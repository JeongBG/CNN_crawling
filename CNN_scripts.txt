COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Bad news it's only Thursday. Good news it's Friday eve and we're going to slay today. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and we have a powerful show for you today. And we start with the ongoing and devastating situation occurring in Nigeria in West Africa. A month ago, the country experienced its worst flooding in a decade. Hundreds were killed as homes and businesses were submerged. Weeks later, the death toll has risen and communities remain underwater, displacing more than one million people from their homes.  Victims of the flood blame the tragedy on the government's response or lack thereof. Government officials say they released flood warnings ahead of the disaster and advised residents to move to safer ground. There is a question as to whether those warnings even reach some communities and experts say proper relief has not reached many Nigerians. Food is scarce in the country and difficult for many to afford. Nigeria's economy is struggling. Inflation hit a 17-year high of over 20 percent in August. This has further strained people's spending power and capacity to relocate. People have lost everything and many survivors are living in terrible conditions in camps and shelters with little to no government assistance. CNN correspondent Larry Madowo has been reporting on this for us on the ground in Bayelsa, Nigeria, where he's seen firsthand the tragic events that people there are facing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Our communities still submerged nearly a month after the flooding began with no end in sight. Boats have become the only way to get around much of Bayelsa State in Southern Nigeria. The streets have turned to rivers, driving entire communities away from their homes.  We have really suffered, she says. Tell the government to help us. UGERE OBI, FLOOD VICTIM:  Again, tell them to come help us. MADOWO:  Everything you own is here under the water and this is your house? OBI:  Yes. Everything. MADOWO:  Some are living rough on the streets, washing with this water, cooking with it and bathing in it. Even people's homes and businesses and livelihoods are already submerged, it's still raining and there is more expected. The Nigerian government is warning this could go until November, so even more of this. This is Nigeria's worst flooding in a decade.  Aniso Handy has remained in this house through it all. ANISO HANDY, FLOOD VICTIM:  Nigerians are used to manage. If not, we would have all died. We have not seen this situation where people are not cared for. But Nigerians care for themselves. We are just like infants that have no father, no mother. MADOWO:  The feeling of abandonment runs deep here. The victims are disappointed with the Nigerian government's response which hasn't declared the flood a national emergency. The floods have affected 33 of Nigeria's 36 states partly due to well above average rainfall.  Bayelsa is among those cut off from the nation with major highways underwater. The situation has been exacerbated by poor drainage infrastructure and an overflowing dam in neighboring Cameroon.  But with a warmer climate causing more intense rainfall, authorities have also blamed it on climate change, angering some Nigerians. In this community though, there are more short-term consequences. It's a tough life to navigate for humans and animals alike, but life must go on.  Larry Madowo, CNN, Bayelsa State, Nigeria. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up today, a debate around driverless cars. Are they safe? Are they needed? Are they helpful?  Well, what do you think?  The technology continues to be tested in various cities around the U.S. and one company called Waymo just announced it's planning to launch robo taxis in one of America's most populated cities, Los Angeles. They've already been tested in Phoenix, Arizona, and San Francisco.  We're talking fully autonomous or self-controlled driverless rides relying on detailed maps and sensors to navigate their surroundings. Proponents say these electric vehicles would provide more eco-friendly modes of transportation, while opponents of safety concerns and say that technology is not quite ready to be taken mainstream. CNN transportation editor Michael Ballaban gives us a glimpse now at a recent experience he had with the full self-driving technology available in a Tesla. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL BALLABAN, CNN TRANSPORTATION EDITOR:  Oh, we've got a situation in front of us. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, no, we're going on the wrong side of the road. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Nope, nope, nope. It wanted to hit the truck.  This is a Tesla model 3. So we are turning on the full self-driving beta. Okay, the car is now officially technically sort of driving itself. Whoa, whoa, that was a really sharp turn the car just tried to make. Oh, we've got a situation in front of us. Whoa. Okay, what we just had in front of us was a UPS truck coming onto our lane. We had a guy in front of us with a cargo bike. To avoid hitting the guy on the bike, the car seemed to want to put us straight into a giant UPS truck. I would prefer not to hit a UPS truck today. So I took over. It does seem to need an interruption every couple of blocks or so. Sometimes if the car is hesitating a little bit I have to intervene. You also have to be ready to take over at any time. Now, this is challenging. Oh, no, we're going on the wrong side of the road. We're not trying to make this car screw up. We're not trying to have a laugh at Elon Musk's suspense. That's not the point. We're really just trying to see how it handles driving in the city.  So far, it's going okay. We're going down a pretty just straight normal road. There's not a lot of pedestrians here and when you're going down a straight road with not a lot of pedestrians, the car actually seems to be doing okay. We're doing right around the speed limit. You know, we're not hitting anything.  The car can see cones. The car can see trucks. The car can see even pedestrians on the other side of the street.  Seeing might not be totally the issue here, it's knowing what to do in challenging situations, stuff that experience teaches you. A lot of people have issues with this being called full self-driving. First and foremost, it's not fully self-driving, I have to sit here. If it was fully self-  driving as promised that would let you take a nap, while you're driving along.  You know, it does seem to be making all the drivers upset. It's the people behind us it's the people honking. Now I'm not saying of truly fully autonomous car will never happen but I think at this point we're still years away. SUBTITLE:  Tesla did not respond to CNN Business' request for comment. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  I like to think of myself as a fun guy, but I've got nothing on these guys. Did you know that mushrooms are the largest life forms on the planet? Yep, they expand and grow underground with interconnected fibers called mycelium, looking for food, often nutrients from soil and trees, alive or dead. In fact, the largest living organism on Earth right now is a single honey mushroom in the Malheur National Forest in Oregon. It's three and a half miles wide about 2,500 acres, and it's believed to be about 2,400 years old. Now, that's a humongous fungus and that's random. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  All right. Halloween is exactly two peace signs days away, and I am loving your costume suggestions that you've been sending me on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok. Lex Luthor, Mr. Clean, keep them coming. I'm @CoyWire there. And speaking of TikTok, 73-year-old sensation Barbara "Babs" Costello has given folks pumpkin to talk about. Carving tips like sprinkling cinnamon in there to treat your olfactory senses. Oh my gord. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBARA COSTELLO, TIKTOK SENSATION:  I'm going to remove all those nasty strings the easier way. SUBTITLE:  This 73-year-old TikTok sensation gave us some hacks on how to improve the spooky season.  In a new video, Barbara "Babs" Costello broke down the do's and don'ts of pumpkin carving.  COSTELLO:  Hi, everybody. It's Babs. Did your mom ever tell you the do's and don'ts of pumpkin carving? SUBTITLE:  1. Carve the pumpkin from your lap. COSTELLO:  Don't stand and carve your pumpkin. Sit. Just put them on your lap. SUBTITLE:  2. Carve from the bottom of your pumpkin. COSTELLO:  Now time to cut the bottom of your pumpkin, not the top.  SUBTITLE:  3. Use a hand mixer to clean out your pumpkin. COSTELLO:  Don't do this. Use your hand mixer instead. Get all those strings cleaned up. Your mixer did the hard work of loosening all those strings. SUBTITLE:  4. Use a red dry erase marker to design the face. COSTELLO:  When designing your pumpkin face, use a dry erasable red marker that you can get rid of the lines after you carve.  SUBTITLE:  5. Carve the design with a rubber mallet and a cookie cutter. COSTELLO:  If you don't want to struggle using a knife to carve your pumpkin, just use a soft-headed mallet and your cookie cutter, and just push it right through. Remove all your red lines. SUBTITLE:  6. Cover all surfaces with Vaseline to keep it fresh. COSTELLO:  Don't let all your work go to waste. Those kids want to enjoy these pumpkins. Take Vaseline and rub it on all the open cut surfaces. We'll keep your pumpkin moist won't dry out as quickly, and it should last about one to two weeks.  SUBTITLE:  7. And finally, sprinkle some cinnamon. COSTELLO:  And if you want a beautifully scented jack-o-lantern, try sprinkling some cinnamon right on the top and over the candle she goes and she smells delicious. Happy Halloween. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. You gorgeous creatures, today is National Civics Day, celebrating the importance of civic education as a foundation for a strong democracy.  And we want to give a strong shout out now, Walnut Cove, North Carolina, Southeastern Stokes Middle School. Rise up and have an awesome day.  It's almost Friday. See you tomorrow.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. It's your boy Coy, and it's Thursday. So, happy Friday eve to you. This is CNN 10. We have an awesome show for you today, so without further ado, let's do what we do. We start today with the latest news out of China. Foxconn, one of Apple's largest suppliers, is racing to control a COVID-19 outbreak at its campus in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou. Trending social media videos show anxious workers reportedly fleeing the lockdown facility earlier this week after experiencing food shortages and difficult living conditions, including mandatory isolation. The city, which has a population of more than 12 million people, identified dozens of COVID-19 cases last month and the Chinese government shows few signs of easing its COVID policies. These events highlight how China's strict zero COVID policy is hurting international business. We'll hear now from my colleague Selina Wang, the CNN international correspondent, reporting on the chaotic conditions at the Foxconn factory. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Chaos at Foxconn, one of Apple's largest suppliers. It's Zhengzhou factory, which is its largest iPhone assembly factory in central China, is trying to contain a COVID flare-up but workers are fleeing the COVID restrictions. Viral videos on social media show masses of workers carrying their luggage trekking long distances across highways. Workers in recent days have been flooding social media with complaints about subpar living conditions, the poor quality of food and the difficulty and getting enough food amid the intense COVID restrictions. The exodus is putting major strain on Foxconn at a critical period just before the holiday season. It's another reminder of how China's zero COVID policy is hurting international businesses. According to analyst estimates, the Zhengzhou factory accounts for as much as 85 percent of Apple's iPhone assembly capacity. According to Counterpoint Research, they estimate that this could jeopardize 10 to 30 percent of the iPhone-14 production if this situation doesn't stabilize in the near term. Now, according to state media, Foxconn is trying to boost capacity production at other sites. The company says it is actually quadrupling bonuses for workers at the Zhengzhou plant in order to incentivize workers to stay. But zero COVID is clearly still having a massive impact on businesses, on people's daily lives, the entire city of Zhengzhou, which is home to more than 12 million people, it's been under lockdown since late October. These constant lockdowns in China are causing global businesses to re- evaluate the reliability of China as a production base. In fact, Apple has been increasing production in places like India in order to reduce its dependency on China. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In Spanish, the word "manta" means what? Blanket, bread, balloon or basket. Manta refers to a type of cloak or blanket which is why manta rays share the name describing the look of the animal's large flat diamond-shaped bodies. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Today is CNN's Call to Earth Day, which aims to highlight the conservation work of organizations and individuals around the world and in connection with that. We have a special feature with marine scientists and Rolex Awards laureate Kerstin Forsberg who's working to protect manta rays in her home country of Peru. I recently had a chance to talk with her about her experience beneath the waves. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KERSTIN FORSBERG, MARINE BIOLOGIST AND CONSERVATIONIST:  The ocean is our source of life. The ocean touches us in every single second. It's, you know, connected with our atmosphere. The ocean provides resources. The ocean provides oxygen in our planet. The ocean provides so many different things to inspire us even on a cultural or emotional level. WIRE:  What made you fall in love with the ocean? Why did you choose this path? FORSBERG:  I was passionate about nature and environment and animals ever since I was a kid. I was always reading about animals, reading about nature. And then I think as I grew up and I decided to start a career in biology, it became really clear to me that the ocean was in real trouble, and that a lot of people needed to really start to think about the importance that the ocean has on our everyday lives. WIRE:  You have designed and developed dozens of environmental initiatives. What are some of the biggest challenges facing our oceans and ocean life right now? FORSBERG:  We're taking all the resources out of it. We're polluting the ocean. We're putting all our waste and dumping all their waste into it. So it's really about thinking of us as our everyday and how we connect to the ocean, and how we can depend on the ocean, but we can also shape the ocean. So, through sustainable seafood consumption, through making sure that we are utilizing our waste properly, and that's how we're going to ultimately stop those challenges which at the end are all about over-exposition, pollution and also climate change and habitat destruction. We started building a network of schools. It's called the Marine Educators Network of Northern Peru. And this network of schools started to grow, in over local schools in northern Peru, connecting between each other with teachers starting to incorporate ocean literacy within classrooms, but then building on that having youth start developing their own environmental projects that benefited their communities. First of all, we work with schools. We partner together with schools and with teachers and we develop an ocean literacy training program in which kids learn about the ocean, learn about how we're connected to the ocean. But even beyond that, they learn about environmental leadership and how to develop their own project. So we're giving them the tools on how to develop a project how to set out goals how to develop your own budget, how to track your progress and in doing that connect kids so we've developing feedback between each other and really developing this sense of global citizenship at the end, right? We all need to start connecting between our ourselves as global citizens in order to move forward and address sustainability challenges. WIRE:  Well, we have a special day, Call to Earth Day. I'm sure you have something up your sleeve or two. FORSBERG:  For Call to Earth Day, we will be hosting an activity in northern Peru, with over 40 different youth. These are local university students and we're partnering with a series of local organizations, including from the regional government and civil society and conservation areas. So, it's really about having everybody together. It's going to be a huge celebration, where different organizations come together, with different youth come together, and again, we're different disciplines, right? Come together, and ultimately, land and sea come together So, that's what it's all about for us, Call to Earth. It's a celebration of our planet that connects us all. WIRE:  Kerstin Forsberg, your -- your smile, your passion are contagious. You inspire us as we aspire to make this world a bit of a better place. Thank you so much for joining us. FORSBREG:  Thank you so much for the invitation. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, we may have bitten off more than we can choo choo. The world's longest ever passenger train took a trip through the Swiss Alps. What ingenuity, this train is 1.2 miles long, made up of a hundred cars, it had to be a slowcomotive, taking about an hour to complete a 15-mile trip, through 22 tunnels, over 48 bridges. The record-breaking event took place on October 29th, the 175th anniversary of Switzerland's first railway. For your news, for some fun, we're here for you train or shine. And so is shout-out time. Mrs. Bush's class at Bosqueville Middle School in Waco, Texas. Think it, speak it, believe it. Did you know that today, November 3rd is National Stress Awareness Day. So, like my four-year-old daughter tells me, smell the flowers, cool the soup. Whenever you feel overwhelmed, don't fret about the future. Don't worry about the past. Just take a deep breath and embrace the power of now. I'm Coy and this is CNN 10. END221103

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey you. You made it to Friday, and you already know Friday's rock. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. And we've got an awesome show for you today. Let's finish this week strong. I have some good news to start your weekend. Many of you get an extra hour of sleep on Sunday, Daylight Saving Time. But could this be the last year of it? Every year on the first Sunday of November at 2:00 a.m., many of us turn our clocks back an hour. On the second Sunday in March, they spring back forward an hour. But where did this idea of shifting time come from and why is it so polarizing? Let's take 10 to break it all down. While Benjamin Franklin gets credit for the first mention of the idea, Daylight Saving Time was first implemented in the U.S. with the Standard Time Act of 1918. A wartime measure with the purpose of adding more daylight hours to conserve energy resources Currently, not all states participate in daylight saving, including most of Arizona and Hawaii. Over 70 countries around the world use daylight saving time with notable exceptions of China and Japan. But earlier this year, the U.S. Senate passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act which would make Daylight Saving Time permanent year round, beginning in the fall of 2023. That bill is currently sitting in the House of Representatives. If passed there and then signed by the president, it would mean no more changing clocks in the U.S. There are, of course, arguments for and against the practice. We'll travel to the United Kingdom now to meet a small group of clockmakers who have a big job of making sure everything is working on time, especially when it comes to the time change. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX JEFFREY, CLOCKMAKER, PALACE OF WESTMINSTER:  I love talking about clocks. I could talk about clocks all day. Not everyone wants to hear about them, but everyone wants to hear about the clocks at the Palace of Westminster. Whether it's Big Ben, whether it's just being interested in such a busy building, working on clocks, doing the time change, maintaining, it's something I take a lot of pride in. REPORTER:  Ian Westworth and Alex Jeffrey are part of a small team of clockmakers at the Palace of Westminster in London. Twice a year, when the clocks spring forward or fall back across the United Kingdom, they have the responsibility of adjusting 2,000 timepieces before lawmakers return to work. JEFFREY:  There's two thousand clocks on the parliamentary estate. There's 500 heritage clocks, there's two days and it's our task to perform the GMT time change. IAN WESTWORTH, CLOCMAKER, PALACE OF WESTMINISTER:  And overnight, we changed Big Ben. The great clock of Westminster and we put that back an hour just to make sure everybody who can now see the dials can actually tell at the right time when they wake up on Sunday morning. JEFFREY:  So, this is one of our heritage clocks. There's around four or five hundred of them, and they're just going to bring the minute hand back to do the time change being careful not to graze the dial, and it's -- in one of the committee rooms along committee corridor where a lot of important meetings happen. WESTWORTH:  We have clocks here that pre-date this palace and some that were designed specifically for this palace. We do actually come across clocks that we've never found before. It only happened the other week. An MP contacted us saying, I've got a clock in my office, it hasn't run for some time. And I'm thinking, I've been here 18 years and I've never been into your office. He said that's probably why it hasn't worked. JEFFREY:  The time changes were put in initially as a mechanism, a practical mechanism to take advantage of daylight hours in the summer. So, it's important I think to keep that tradition. REPORTER:  In the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill championed the concept of daylight saving during the First World War before he became prime minister, believing that the country could save energy by stretching the hours of evening sunlight. The practice has spread across the world. In the U.S. most states observe daylight saving moving clocks forward in the spring. Only Hawaii and most of Arizona don't. In 2022, the Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act, a law which would make Daylight Saving Time permanent across the United States from November 5th, 2023. If passed by the House, the clocks would not fall back again. In the U.K., a 2019 poll showed that a small majority of Britons want to keep changing the clocks. At the Palace of Westminster, its resident clockmakers are responsible for maintaining this tradition. WESTWORTH:  Even with this digital world, you know, everybody's got a computer with a clock at the bottom or they've got a digital watch on. But the MPS and the lords or the staff, who've actually got a ticking clock in their office. One of the first things they look at is the ticking clock and not the one on the wrist. Our job is to make sure that every day, these clocks are working for them. The last clock of the day before doing great clock tonight. JEFFREY:  You know, there's a lot of ground to cover. I left my step count on last year and it was 55,000 steps. It's very time consuming but it's very rewarding. You know, we can say to each other, well done, guys. It's a job well done and when people turn up for work on Monday, they're right on time. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And now it's time for some hero talk. We've been introducing you to CNN Heroes since the start of the school year. Together, we met a woman upcycling old computers to open new worlds for young people in our home country of Kenya. We met a teacher in New Jersey on a mission to hand out free books by the thousands. This week, CNN announced the top heroes of the year. Let's meet them and hear how they are making this world a better place. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  From California when elderly dog owners can no longer care for their pets, Carie Broecker helps them stay together or finds these beloved family members new forever homes. From Nashville, Richard Casper uses art to heal the wounds of war. He's helping fellow veterans share their stories visually and vocally. Nelly Cheboi is bringing technology to young people in her native Kenya, recycling old computers, she provides the tools and education for brighter futures. North Carolina innovator Nora El-Khouri Spencer is training women for well- paying careers in construction while also helping seniors age safely at home. From south Philadelphia after spending five years in prison on drug charges, Tyrique Glasgow is now providing his neighborhood long challenged by poverty and gun violence with safety and opportunity. Alaskan nurse Teresa Gray leads volunteer medics into global hot spots, delivering vital care and support to those in need. Meymuna Hussein-Cattan is helping refugees and immigrants transition to lives in the U.S. with critical resources and support while also sharing their culture with the L.A. community. Aidan Reilly brought together a nationwide network of young volunteers tackle food waste and insecurity they're rescuing tons of excess produce from farms to feed the hungry. From Chicago, Deborah Vines struggled to find support and resources when her son Jason was diagnosed with autism. Now, she's providing services and education to African American families and first responders. And Atlanta's Bobby Wilson is feeding and healing his urban community by teaching thousands of people how to plant grow and prepare their own healthy food. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: American, Bridal Veil, and Horseshoe are features that combine to make what natural wonder? Great Barrier Reef, Niagara Falls, Grand Canyon, or Galapagos Islands. Located on the U.S. Canadian border, these are the names of the three waterfalls that together make Niagara Falls. (END VIDEO CLIP) WEIR:  We're giving this next story an A-plus, a gold star, and a 10 out of 10. Niagara Falls, one of the natural wonders of the world, on the New York and Canadian border, draws visitors from every corner of the planet who come to see its majestic cascading water. Well, there's a tunnel buried deep beneath the falls. It's been off limits until now. It's about seven football fields long it was built more than a century ago on the Canadian side as part of the former Niagara Parks Power Station. And visitors can now venture through the plant down the corridor and onto a waterside platform for some of the most breathtaking views in the world. This has been an awesome week.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  It is Monday and it's going to be the best day because it's the next day. I'm Coy, here with your news, some inspiration and a little bit of fun. Thanks for choosing us to help you start your week strong. We begin today with news on the Mississippi River. This video shows the river at historically low levels from Illinois to Louisiana. Experts say the record low water levels are due to the worst drought in the central part of the United States in at least a decade and that we can expect to see continued decreasing levels in the months to come. Lack of rain or snow over a period of time and atmospheric conditions such as temperature change and changes in the jet stream are all factors that can contribute to drought and low water levels. According to the U.S. drought monitor, half of the United States is covered by moderate drought conditions or worse, with more than 134 million people affected. That's the highest part of the population since 2016. And the Midwest has seen the worst of it. Several inches of rain are possible over the next week near the Mississippi River which could provide some relief but the drought is forecast to continue through January and low water levels have some serious consequences. They could impact crops at a crucial time for harvest and allow for salt water from the Gulf of Mexico to travel up the Mississippi River which could potentially spoil Louisiana drinking water with salt.  And while the Army Corps of Engineers has been dredging or excavating portions of the river's basin to make a path for boat traffic to keep flowing. It's at such a slow pace, hundreds of barges and vessels carrying goods are waiting for the all-clear to be able to pass through the shallow river. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  To navigate this river in the old South, a man would stand on the prowess steam ship and bounce a lead weight on a knotted string off the bottom. If it was a safe 12 feet deep, he'd shout "Mark Twain". Samuel Clemens made that his pen name, of course.  But if he wrote about this river today, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn would spend a lot of time walking on the beach because in too many places, the not so mighty Mississippi is a fraction of a Twain. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're going to look at a few old steamboats, steamboat racks. WEIR:  Mark Twain era steamboats? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah. WEIR:  And the relentless drought across the heartland is exposing all kinds of memories. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It may have caught on fire or sank 50 miles upstream and floated here during floods. WEIR:  As far as water levels go, this is as worse if you've ever seen? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is about as low as I've seen it. WEIR:  From the Missouri down to New Orleans, accidental archaeologists are finding steamboat graveyards and human remains, Civil War ammo and forgotten shipwrecks. And one of the more striking yardsticks is here in Baton Rouge. This is the USS Kidd, a World War II destroyer, and on a good year the Mississippi comes to that first rush strike, about 25 feet above my head right now. And these water levels are so low creating such a catastrophic shipping crisis that this is going to affect your grocery bill, is the price of moving. A bushel of soybeans went up 300 percent and there are thousands of barges full of food and all they can do is just wait and pray for rain. And if they can't get rain, they pray for help. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We've got a difficult stretch of river. WEIR:  From the Army Corps of Engineers, with billions of dollars on the line, they cut channels as fast as they can with working antiques like the Dredge Potter. Built in 1932 but still a workhorse and an endless fight with the river in every kind of weather. You're a professional riverbed redecorator. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kind of, yeah, yeah.  WEIR:  A little of this over here. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's right. WEIR:  Over there. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As long as we can keep barges moving and keep commodities prices down, we're all in good shape. WEIR:  That's your -- that's your mission. It's impressive to see up front. Andy, you know the Ole Miss better than most, huh? You've been doing this a while. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thirty-four years. (LAUGHTER) WEIR:  And how would you characterize what's going on these days? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is a concern, a heightened concern. I don't know that I -- we call it a panic yet, but we are watching the water levels very closely, on an almost an hourly basis.  WEIR:  Is it the kind of thing where if this goes on you can dredge around the problem? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  To a point. In 1989 and then again in 2012, we got to an area where the chan -- to a level where the channel was almost unsustainable. So we had numerous dredges working and there was very little commerce going through. And ultimately, what saved the day was rain. WEIR:  And these days, when you wish for rain, you have to specify not all at once. The Midwest is still recovering from summer flash floods. And if the water cycle whiplashes again, hard rain on parched earth would be another blow to farmers, already struggling to move their harvest.  Fewer and lighter barges on the river means more expensive trains and trucks putting more planet cooking pollution into Earth's system. And on a connected planet where one in eight humans eat something that was moved down the Mississippi, those hearty souls on the Dredge Potter are going to need a lot more help.

But everything from fuel leaks to hurricanes have already stalled the mission. Liftoff is now scheduled for November 14th and Artemis is back on the launch pad waiting for its big moment. But if you can't wait, there may be a way for you to get that moonwalking feeling right here on Earth. A new invention from Shift Robotics aims to make walking faster and more efficient. But will they revolutionize the way we walk? That remains to be seen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) XUNJIE ZHANG, CEO, SHIFT ROBOTICS:  Instead of replacing walking, what if we can augmenting or enhancing walking? REPORTER:  These are not roller skates, they are moonwalkers designed by Shift Robotics, a startup out of the robotics lab at Carnegie Mellon University. ZHANG:  I think the biggest problem is just the walking is too slow, it's super inefficient to get around by walking. So instead of replacing walking, what if we can you know augmenting or enhancing walking? REPORTER:  The company says these battery powered shoes can boost walking speeds up to seven miles an hour. Using a machine learning algorithm, Shift Robotics says the shoes can adapt to a user's walking pattern in real time. ZHANG:  You know, even though it has some elements of roller skate. You never freeloading, you just go -- they only move when you want to move. REPORTER:  Moonwalkers can fit most shoes with flexible straps that can be easily taken on and off with magnetic buckles. With speed limitation tech and braking systems the company claims the shoes are safe to use on on sidewalks or in crowded areas. ZHANG:  Outside the personal commuting or running errand scenes we think they're going to be great on distribution centers supermarket stores like warehouses for example where it's not fully automated but that still require lots of people walking around. REPORTER:  Shift Robotics also claims that users can walk over six miles after a single charge of an hour and a half. The company says it will deliver the first batch of shoes to consumers in March 2023 at nearly fourteen hundred dollars.  ZHANG:  I think at one day, you know, once we achieve economy scales, we will be able to drop the price we will be able to develop newer models that will allow us ultimately to drive the cost down.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is a hoot, a textbook example of parody by a parrot. TV reporter Nicholas Crum was in Chile telling a story about rising crime rates when a parrot pulls off an impeccable heist stealing the headphone right out of his ear. He gone. Crum, he needs to be more careful. He had someone else chase the thief for him so he could continue his report. Apparently, Crum suspected foul play. Well, the whole thing was caught on camera and where it is, he did get his headphone back. All right. Without feather ado, my favorite parrot of the day, I want to give a special shout out to West Side Middle School in Charleston, West Virginia.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, hello. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy. Grateful to be spending part of my day right here with you on CNN 10. Today is the first Tuesday in November and that means election day across America. Millions of Americans head to the polls to cast their ballots but they won't be choosing the next U.S. president. Americans will cast their votes for representatives in Congress and candidates for state and local offices.  Every two years, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for election while only about a third of the 100-seat Senate are up for grabs. These are called midterm elections because they happen two years into a U.S. president's four-year term. The midterms are the first chance for voters to weigh in on President Biden's term, policies and vision for America. All eyes are on Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania, four states that President Biden flipped to Democrat in the election but are now battlegrounds states that Republicans could win back. Issues at the top of mind for voters are, the economy, social issues, immigration, concerns about violent crime and concerns about election security and the election process itself.  This year, early voting has surged in some key states, including Georgia, which shattered records for early voter turnout but rain forecasted across the country today could impact voter turnout on election day. We'll hear more now from CNN's Karin Caifa about today's elections and what Americans might expect as results come in. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARIN CAIFA, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  President Joe Biden isn't on the ballot, but for most Americans, it's their first chance to weigh in on his party and policies. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This election isn't a referendum, it's a choice. It's a choice between two fundamentally different visions of America. CAIFA:  Among states taking center stage in the battle for the U.S. Senate tight races in four that president Biden flipped in the 2020 presidential election, Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania were Biden and former President Barack Obama stumped Saturday. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT:  Democracy itself is on the ballot. The stakes are high.  CAIFA:  And former President Donald Trump also rallied. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT:  This election is your chance to make your voice heard. CAIFA:  Underscoring how 2022 may foreshadow the 2024 presidential contest. Polls indicate most voters are looking at the economy right now as they cast ballots. Democrats touted Friday's October jobs report and unemployment still near a half century low as assigned their economic policies are working, while Republicans point to the highest inflation in 40 years.  SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI):  The inflation crushing our pocketbooks, can't fill up our tank, can't fill up our grocery cart. CAIFA:  Democrats hope the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June will motivate voters, especially women, while Republicans have accused Democrats of being weak on crime especially in major cities.  Both parties eager to drive turnout in their favor. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Name the peninsula in Egypt located between the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea. Sinai, Iberian, Arabian or Yucatan? Sinai peninsula is the answer here and at the southern tip is where you'll find the Egyptian city of Sharm El-sheikh. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  This week and next in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, tens of thousands of world leaders, representatives, negotiators, businesses and citizens will gather for the COP27 Conference. Twenty-seven because this is the 27th year that the global climate summit has been held. The focus of these conferences is climate change. The U.N. says this was a fringe issue when the summits began, but it's now a global priority though different nations have different levels of commitment to it. Carbon dioxide emissions are front and center here. Most scientists say these emissions are harming the global environment by causing earth's average temperatures to rise a smaller group of scientists says that climate change happens naturally and that the earth can absorb human carbon emissions. But the goal of these U.N. summits is for member countries to lay out new plans to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide. Let's take a look now at the history of these COP conferences as nations continue to debate the issues that relate to the health of the planet. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  COP stands for Conference of the Parties. The gatherings are intense technical negotiations brokered by the U.N. Countries are meant to work together to coordinate a global effort to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. But progress at successive COP summits has been limited. RAUL ESTRADA-OYUELA, KYOTO COP3 CHAIRMAN:  This is a very long process. It will take decades. PAULA DOBRIANSKY, HEAD OF U.S. DELEGATION, BALI, COP13:  We will go forward and join consensus in this today. LEONARDO DICAPRIO, UN MESSENGER OF PEACE: Now must be our moment for action. REPORTER:  The first climate COP summit took place in Berlin in 1995, and representatives from more than states or territories attended. Two years later, progress. The parties at COP3 in Japan agreed to the Kyoto Protocol in which 37 industrialized states or territories were legally bound to start reducing their emissions.  But the biggest polluter at the time the United States refused to ratify the agreement because it didn't oblige developing nations like China to cut emissions. In the following years, climate change slipped on and off the global agenda. After 9/11, the world's attention shifted to fighting international terrorism. Climate issues took a back seat. All the while, greenhouse gas emissions continue to soar and without the United States and China on board, the Kyoto protocol began to crumble, successive climate summits produced few results. COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009 was highly anticipated, but fell short.  BUYELWA SONJICA, SOUTH AFRICAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTER:  It's not acceptable. It's definitely not acceptable. It's disappointing. REPORTER:  Then at COP21 in Paris, there was a breakthrough. In 2015, the Paris agreement was adopted by more than 190 parties, including the U.S. and China, and effectively replaced Kyoto. Its ambition was to limit global warming to well below two, but preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But the watchdog Climate Action Tracker shows that all major economies are off track to meeting their obligations to contain temperature rise and as governments lagged in fulfilling their pledges a new wave of youth-led environmental activism was born. GRETA THUNBERG, CLIMATE ACTIVIST:  All what you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you? DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, before Paris, France. REPORTER:  Then, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris agreement, only for his successor President Biden to bring the U.S. back into it.  JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  This moment demands urgency. Good ideas and good intentions aren't good enough. REPORTER:  At COP26 in Glasgow, developed countries pledged $100 billion annually to support developing countries in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting their economies.  But the conference also had its shortcomings. India successfully demanded that the final agreement would commit countries to phase down rather than phase out coal. JOURNALIST:  It's according to science, sir. It's according to science. BHUPENDER YADAV, INDIAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTER:  No, not at all. REPORTER:  Fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas emit heat trapping greenhouse gas emissions. And if we don't cut those emissions dramatically, scientists predict global temperatures could warm by three degrees by the end of the century. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Now for today's 10 out of 10, we're bringing you a tasty story that's going to wake you up. People deep-fry chicken, they deep-fry potatoes. I've even heard of deep fried Oreos.  But coffee? How to even do that? James Hoffman, a coffee connoisseur and author, deep fried the coffee beans for 14-1/2 minutes. And he says it created a soft and buttery cup of Joe rich but not greasy, I guess you could deep fry just about anything. I think my weakness is French fries. I can eat them all day, every day.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Wonderful Wednesday to you. I know we're just halfway through the week, but we're going to keep on grinding and shining because that's just what we do. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10 and we've got a rendezvous with the news. Yesterday was election day in America. Millions of adults all across the country went to the polls to cast their votes for representatives in Congress, senators and state and local officials. The results were still coming in when we produced this show for the latest info check out CNN.com where results are updated in real time. But between early voting which shattered state records in Georgia and absentee ballots and the sheer volume of votes on election day it could be a while before we know who the winners are all eyes are on the results in Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania, battleground states that Biden flipped to Democratic states in the 2020 presidential election. But now, Republicans are hoping to gain control there. Experts say the 2022 midterm results could foreshadow the 2024 presidential contest. Polls indicate that most voters rank the economy as the number one issue on their minds, but women's rights, guns and public safety as well as immigration and election security are also major issues that are important to voters in this election. Let's hear now from chief national correspondent John King in the election center who explains the early signs he's looking for as election results come in. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Let's start in the House. JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Four hundred thirty-five races in all, under new lines because of the census two years ago, the redistricting process. As you know better than anybody, they're not all competitive. So, what we've done is we've identified working with our partners at inside elections, 82 competitive seats heading into election day. And as you can see, they are coast to coast. Another way to look at it, look at this, just to understand Democrats are on defense. It's a Democratic president's first midterm. It's a tough climate, just look down here at the key to these seats. BASH:  Yeah. KING:  Fifty-seven of the competitive seats have Democratic incumbents almost three times as many, almost three times as many of Republicans. There are three new seats here too as you look at the map. So Democrats are on their heels defending much more territory in a tough year. That's one way to look at it. Now let's bring it up, the big question is, who can get to 2018, right? And in our rankings right now, we already have Republicans favored in seats. Now some of those are just barely favored you see the lighter red on the map. But Republicans have a huge advantage going into election day and if you look down and, you know, the race is very well. These toss-up races go coast to coast. BASH:  Let's look at the Senate. Obviously right now, 50-50. KING:  Right. BASH:  It could go so many different ways. KING:  The chess game here, you can game it out. Reasonably, Democrats winning here, Republicans winning there were elections in all. Again, you work with -- we've worked with our partners here to identify the competitive seats. Eight elections of the Senate, we view as competitive. It could be more. Republicans think they could surprise us in some places of these eight. They're evenly divided now between held by Democrats or held by Republicans. Best way to look at this is to come into the balance of power as you come into the control right now. Again, Democrats enter the election, 50-50. The vice president United States breaks the ties. So Democrats can't afford to lose essentially. And so, you have the states on the map if you come in now to how we rank them, the goal or the toss-up states, one is a Republican held state right now, no incumbent Pennsylvania, Democratic incumbent in Georgia, the probably the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent you were just out there in Nevada. BASH:  Yeah. KING:  This is where the chess gets fascinating. BASH:  Yeah. And so many -- I mean, you're saying that these yellow are maybe the tightest, but that might belie what we're actually seeing on the ground, which is a wider swath of really, really tight races. KING:  But it is possible, again, we know these races are competitive right. But we still tilt New Hampshire Democratic, Republicans think they can pick up that seat. We still tilt Arizona Democratic; Republicans think that one is within their reach. They say watch, we still have -- this as likely Dem up in Washington state, in Colorado, Republicans say keep an eye on everything. So you could -- you conceivably could get Republicans to 52 or 53. You can also get the Democrats to 51 or stay status quo at 50. Again, this race could decide the Senate. In the end, does anybody get above or are we going are we going another month? BASH:  Or are we going to be standing here in December? KING:  On December 6th, but you were just out here. This is what Democrats worry about most. They view Catherine Cortez Masto as the most vulnerable Democrat and again think about the math, right? We won't know that one because it's out west, right? The Democrats would love to pick up Pennsylvania as a safety valve an insurance policy against maybe losing out in Nevada. BASH:  It is going to be a long and very exciting night. KING:  Week. BASH:  Maybe week. John King, thank you. KING:  Thank you. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In what sport would you find a gully, sweeper and a wicket keeper? Curling, bowling, cricket or lacrosse? The answer here is cricket in which the only field are allowed to wear gloves is called the wicket keeper. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Our next story involves the sport of cricket but it's about so much more than the intricacies of the game. It showcases a much broader dynamic of sports and highlights the importance of camaraderie, lifting each other up and setting aside differences to work together towards something greater than ourselves. Steffan Nero is visually impaired. He struggled to fit in, but his life changed when he found his squad, and he's gone on to shatter records. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUBTITLE:  Steffan Nero is not your average athlete. Born with two visual impairments, he struggled at school, failing to find a place where he felt he fitted in. After discovering visually impaired sports, Australian Nero started playing blind cricket and found new horizons. STEFFAN NERO, BLIND CRICKETER:  Sport is for me is such a big part of my life. like I can't really understate it, to be honest. I never really connected with other people my age regarding, you know, just obviously other people who didn't have the same obviously sight condition as me. But I usually felt quite lonely at high in high school. Sport, I would say, really changed my life and really pushed me to realize that I do have a lot of potential. I'd say I've flourished in a way. I became much more confident in myself. Part of a family, you're part of a group, you all dealt with the same experiences. You can speak to each other, and that's something that I really needed when I was growing up, because I think without it I've been a much more -- much different situation without those kinds of experiences. SUBTITLE:  Blind cricket differs from the able-bodied version in a number of ways. Players of varying visual impairments bowl a ball with internal bearings underhanded, allowing it to be heard. Nero etched his name into sporting history when he scored a record-breaking 309 not out innings against New Zealand. NERO:  Once I got the 300-mark, I was just like, okay, this is, you know, I can even make history here. When everyone was clapping as well, it was amazing feeling to experience and something I could say I'll never forget for the rest of my life. Obviously, it wasn't just me, but it was the team and my coaching staff, everyone, my parents, everyone. But still my name was said, Steffan Nero has made 309. So still a very special moment. SUBTITLE:  Although the response was overwhelmingly positive, there were still some negative comments around the record. NERO:  Majority of people obviously very crisp of saying, oh, wow, didn't realize this game that I think it can -- it helps to kind of change people's minds a bit about what disability means as well. I did hear a few comments saying oh you know it's just disability cricket. You know that kind of thing. But like I said a lot of people just making jokes about it as well, which happens, you know, that's the way it is on social media. After a while, I stopped looking at the comments and stuff as well and just kind of just ignored it and said, you know what, this is something that I think is really positive for blind cricket, for people with disabilities in Australia as well. SUBTITLE:  As well as furthering the sport, Nero wants to use his position to inspire the next generation. NERO:  I always say, if you try something, you don't like it, then that's fine. Unless you've tried it, you know, you're taking that first step. It probably will be the hardest thing you ever do, but once it happens and you're involved in that kind of group and that community, I think things get much easier and can be quite a really rewarding experience. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10 story might cause an uproar, and I ain't even lying. The Oklahoma City zoo needs names for its litter of African lion cubs, and it's asking the public to pick 'em. Born September 26 at the zoo's lion overlook habitat, these cute baby lions are the zoo's first in 15 years. Before the cubs are old enough to be put in public display though, they need names. But before you toss out names like Santa Claws (ph), Empe-roar (ph), or Kitty Purrie (ph), you have to cast your vote on a pre-approved name on a list on the zoo's website. Shout out time now. High five and a high 10 to Maclay Middle School in Tallahassee, Florida. Hope you all have a happy day. And remember, happiness isn't some idea that we have to chase or find or create. Happiness is right here, right now, whenever we choose to embrace it. Much love and many blessings. I'm Coy and this is CNN 10. END221110

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. I'm Coy Wire. Here to help you jump-start your week with the best minutes in news right here on CNN 10.  let's start today with an update on the midterm elections. Last week, millions of adults across the country went to the polls to cast their votes for representatives in Congress senators and state and local officials Democrats performed better than predicted. They are projected to retain majority control of the U.S. Senate after winning a pivotal race in Nevada.  Now Democrats will hold 50 Senate seats with Republicans currently holding 49. A December runoff election in the state of Georgia could earn Republicans a matching 50th Senate seat but Democrats would still hold a tie-breaking vote in the Senate which belongs to Vice President Kamala Harris. But the race isn't over yet Republicans may win the House of Representatives as votes continue to be tallied from a handful of districts. If Republicans win the House, they could still stop a significant portion of President Biden's Democratic agenda in his medical proposals. Congress makes nationwide laws. The House decides which laws are voted on, while the Senate can approve or block them and confirm appointments made by the president. Let's hear now from CNN's Jessica Schneider, a justice correspondent based in Washington. She has an update on President Biden's proposal to forgive some student loan debt which would need clear congressional authorization to go through. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  A federal judge out of Texas who is actually nominated by President Trump is now saying President Biden just does not have the power to forgive these student loans by executive order and instead, President Biden would need clear congressional authorization to forgive these loans and he would have had to go through more of a process rather than just simply issuing an executive order.  However, we will see an appeal of this decision. The Justice Department has already noticed that it will appeal and this is ultimately a decision that could be determined by the Supreme Court. Of course, President Biden issued this executive order in August. It's estimated that if it goes through, it would ultimately cost about $400 billion.  The program though now in doubt, and it's also been on hold for the past month because of another court decision out of a circuit court that put the loan forgiveness rollout on hold while all these legal challenges play out.  You know, we know that about 26 million borrowers already have applied for this debt relief. The government had already approved million of those applications, but no debt at all will be canceled for the foreseeable future here because of these court challenges. The White House press secretary did however say that the Department of Education will hold on to the information of all of these applicants so it could be processed pretty quickly if the program is ultimately given the green light in court. But we'll have to see how the courts decide this. If it does go all the way to the Supreme Court, it's possible that the conservative majority on the Supreme Court could nix this program as well. You know this has been a majority that's often skeptical of wide-ranging executive and agency action, so this debt forgiveness program could ultimately. Be deemed unconstitutional and if that happens none of these millions of people would get any debt relief. But for now this program is also on hold. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, a film crew searching the Atlantic Ocean for World War II artifacts unexpectedly swam upon something much more modern, a 20-foot long piece of the Space Shuttle Challenger which exploded shortly after liftoff in 1986. CNN's space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT:  It was the space shuttle's very distinctive heat shield tiles that really gave these divers their first clue that perhaps they had found a piece of NASA's old space shuttle Challenger and you can see in the video these white square tiles that are you know partially covered by sand now in the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean and those white tiles would have been used to protect the underbelly of the space shuttle from the very high temperatures that it would encounter as it re-entered the earth's atmosphere.  So the lead team member on this expedition, the guy by the name of Mike Barnett, he had a friend who was a former NASA astronaut. He showed him this video and that made them convinced that this is indeed what they had found. They brought it to NASA and NASA confirmed it, announcing the findings just this week. And so, the big question now is what does NASA do with this? By law, any piece of a space shuttle is NASA property. So NASA is trying to find a way to do something with this 20-feet section to do something that would really honor the memory of these seven astronauts that were killed back in January of 1986, including Christa McAuliffe who of course would have been the very first teacher in space. Kristin Fisher, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which U.S. government agency measures job market activity and working conditions? Department of Commerce, Department of State, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics? The Bureau of Labor Statistics serves as the statistical resource for the U.S. Department of Labor. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  For the past year, the job market has been strong. In October, the economy created 261,000 new jobs. But things may not quite be what they seem. Job hires dropped to a low not seen in more than a year and a half.  We'll hear now from CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich who's finding out why getting a job might not be as easy as some might think, and how some people are getting creative to get noticed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARLY PAVLINAC, JOB SEEKER:  I'm open to all options. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Karly Pavlinac is on stage in a high-stakes competition. The potential prize: a new job. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How do you make sure you're working with the right talent, you're finding the right connections? PAVLINAC:  The biggest thing is just being able to communicate the idea. YURKEVICH:  This is not the first time Pavlinac has done something unconventional to land an interview, since losing her marketing job in September. After she didn't hear back for a position at Nike, she sent them a cake with her resume on it.  PAVLINAC:  I've been applying obviously that hasn't worked yet, so let me throw something new in the mix and see if that you know works. YURKEVICH:  Her resume cake making headlines.  PAVLINAC:  I've since talked to a bunch of people at Nike but still no job. YURKEVICH:  But the economic data tells a different story. The jobs market is strong. There are 10.7 million open positions, labor shortages and hundreds of thousands of jobs being added each month.  Yet some job seekers even with a viral cake moment can't seem to land one. LIZ ANN SONDERS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST:  On the surface, this is still fairly strong labor market. But if you go a couple of layers under, you are starting to see more significant cracks in the surface that suggest we should eventually see it in those more popular headline type labor market readings. YURKEVICH:  Cracks like a slowdown in hiring, as seen in this week's job opening survey. Hires dropping to 6.1 million, the lowest since February 2021, and the tech industry is shutting jobs percent more than last year.  PAVLINAC:  My perception of the job market was there were a ton of jobs out there and it was going to be easy to find a job, and that actually hasn't been the case. YURKEVICH:  Another crack of the 10.7 million open jobs, some companies might be advertising positions they aren't actively trying to fill. PAVLINAC:  I have applied to many jobs that they're still sitting there, that's been a giant question in my head.  YURKEVICH:  It's called pipelining talent. Companies post jobs to develop a pool of candidates. Recruiter Laura Mazzullo says she sees companies do it all the time. LAURA MAZZULLO, FOUNDER, EAST SIDE STAFFING:  Candidates don't know that's what's happening. So they're being pipelined when actually they think they're applying for an active job and this is where we're seeing a bit of a disconnect.  YURKEVICH:  That may mean as the labor market weakens, job seekers can't be as picky. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our goal is potentially to give away two jobs tonight. PAVLINAC:  I have been picking in that sense of where I want to work but I know what I want. I'm still searching, still talking to people. I've come to terms that it is taking longer than I thought. YURKEVICH:  Vanessa Yurkevich, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10 is from Minnesota man James Rasmussen as we head into the holiday season. He's hoping to avoid the terra bowel experience he had last season. He couldn't figure out who-who was cutting his outdoor Christmas lights. Turns out it was the owl who stole Christmas, using the lights to deck its own halls, its nest under Rasmussen's deck. Critters, there's no talon what they'll do. Better luck nest time Mr. Rasmussen. Without further owl do, a special shout out now to Ryan Middle in Fairbanks, Alaska. Wishing you and everyone watching around the world some motivation this Monday.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy. Grateful to be spending part of my day with you right here on CNN 10. We have a great show today, so let's get to it. We're going to begin with the news out of Bali where the G20 Summit is taking place. The global 20 is an intergovernmental forum between countries that addresses major issues related to the global economy. President Joe Biden held a three-hour talk Monday with the president of China, Xi Jinping. The meeting was their first in-person encounter since President Biden took office and an opportunity for both countries to improve deteriorating relations. Dialogue between them hit a new low in August when U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, a choice that upset China. Expectations for major change were low headed into the meeting. The White House said in a statement afterwards that President Biden raised concerns about China's human rights violations, but that the two countries found areas of agreement especially when it came to the war in Ukraine. In addition, the two nations promised to work together on global climate issues, world health and food security, and they pledge to keep communication open. But at the heart of the U.S.-Chinese relations is the Taiwan question. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Will Ripley in Taipei. The capital of ROC, the Republic of China, commonly known as Taiwan. This island is a vibrant democracy of $23 million people and a key ally of the United States, about 100 miles from mainland China. SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  And I'm Selina Wang in Beijing the capital of China, officially called the People's Republic of China. The PRC was founded in by the victorious Communist Party after a bloody civil war. RIPLEY:  On the losing side, the nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek who had ruled since the 1920s, they fled here to Taiwan where the ROC flag still flies today. Two sides both claiming control of one country, a decades-long dispute, halting travel and trade and leaving a lingering threat of war. WANG:  Initially, both the United States and the United Nations recognized Taipei as the seat of the Chinese government. But amid the shifting political relations at the height of the Cold War, that changed in the 1970s. The PRC replaced the ROC at the U.N. and the United States changed diplomatic relations. It moved its embassy from Taipei to here in Beijing. While the U.S. has adopted a so-called one China policy, it has never recognized the communist party sovereign claim over Taiwan. Washington continues to sell weapons to Taipei, but it has remained deliberately unclear about whether it would come to Taiwan's defense in the event of a Chinese invasion. It keeps Beijing guessing. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You know, you hear people saying Biden wants to start a new Cold War with China. I don't want a cold war with China. I just want to make China understand that we are not going to step back. We are not going to change any of our views. RIPLEY:  That looming threat of invasion is only part of China's ongoing campaign to squeeze Taiwan. Decades of diplomatic pressure by Beijing means this island has very few formal diplomatic allies, because any nation that wants to normalize relations with China has to sever formal diplomatic ties with Taipei. The island's Olympic team can't even carry the Taiwanese flag. They have to compete under the name Chinese Taipei. In Singapore, in 1992, the two sides did agree at least in theory to the existence of one China. WANG:  It's impossible to overstate just how important Taiwan is to the ruling communist party and its legitimacy. China sees the self-ruled island as a breakaway province that must be reunified with the mainland, even by force if necessary. Reunification is also rooted in the communist party's goal to reverse China's century of humiliation by colonial powers. That means returning China's borders to something more like that of the Qing Empire. It's the basis of modern China's claims to Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong and Taiwan. RIPLEY:  Putting sovereignty on the back burner gave Taiwan's economy a boost. Cross strait trade, tourism and money moving again. In 2015, the ruling parties on both sides met again in Singapore, a historic summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Taiwan's then President Ma Ying-jeou. One year later, a turning point. Taiwan's 2016 election of Tsai Ing-wen, the island's first female president, leading a longtime pro-independence party. Tensions rising ever since, something Taiwan blames on China's plan to push its power across the Indo-Pacific. Taiwan's young democracy divided on the issue of unification with the mainland. The tide is turning. In 2020, Tsai won a landslide re-election, vowing to defend Taiwan's democracy from she's increasingly powerful and authoritarian China. Cross strait ties plunging to their lowest level in decades. TSAI ING-WEN, PRESIDENT OF TAIWAN (translated):  The broadest consensus among the Taiwanese people and our various political parties is that we must defend our national sovereignty, our free and democratic way of life. On this point, we have no room for compromise. WANG:  With U.S.-China tensions at an all-time high, Washington and Taipei have moved closer. In 2016, then U.S. President-elect Donald Trump broke a decade-long precedent and spoke to President Tsai on the phone. He also elevated official exchanges between Washington and Taipei, a move that infuriated Beijing. RIPLEY:  China's refusal to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine has many here asking, what is Beijing planning for Taiwan, testing the island's defenses, flying scores of warplanes near the island, making President Xi's long-standing calls for peaceful reunification ring hollow? REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  We will not allow China to isolate Taiwan. RIPLEY:  In August 2022, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi became the highest ranking U.S. lawmaker to visit this island in 25 years, a move Beijing call a major political provocation. In response, China launched military exercises beyond the median line encircling the island. During her visit, Pelosi delivered the unequivocal message that America stands with Taiwan. But if the time comes, would the U.S. send in American troops to defend this Chinese-speaking democracy, a democracy with an uncertain future? (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: When compared to Earth, the atmosphere of Mars is? Thinner, thicker, or about the same? The atmosphere of Mars is over 100 times thinner than Earth. And actually, that thin atmosphere on Mars presents challenges for NASA. (END VIDEO CLIP) A new initiative from NASA called LOFTID could be a potential solution and will determine if a giant inflatable shield could protect spacecrafts against the heat of re-entering the atmosphere. The shield can withstand 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit and at feet in diameter, it's also the largest blunt object ever to return from space. The technology would help spacecrafts enter Mars's thin atmosphere because the Martian atmosphere can't decelerate a spacecraft as quickly and coolly as Earth's atmosphere. And we're ending today's show with a bang for 10 out of 10. Check out this massive explosion in western Kentucky. Drop them like it's hot. These three structures are actually cooling towers at a closed coal plant. The towers were 435 feet tall until they weren't. Tennessee Valley Authorities said the blast was done on purpose to clear the land for future use. The dramatic footage shows the towers slowly collapsing to the ground with clouds of dust all around. The Drakesboro, Kentucky, plant was active for nearly 60 years before effectively closing in 2020. And now to my favorite part of the day, I want to give a special shout out to Crown Point High School in Crown Point, Indiana. Go Bulldogs! Thank you so much for watching.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, everyone? It's Wednesday. Are you hanging in there? Let's smell the flowers and cool the soup.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10.  Just a few more days and we are on the Thanksgiving break. So let's rock. We're going to start today though with news out of India, where air quality is an ongoing issue.  New Delhi, India, is the world's most polluted capital according to IQAir, a Swiss company that measures air quality. It's blanketed in smog every winter as the cold air traps dust in the atmosphere above the city.  In March of this year, firefighters battled ablaze in New Delhi at a landfill site. The fire cloaked the area in a toxic haze and smoke choked residents for days. Factories, construction sites and primary schools were ordered to shut down, and Delhi authorities urged people to work from home. There's currently a debate in India over how to handle waste. There's no processing of waste in most Indian cities, according to the government's central pollution board and in some cases trash is simply burned in open dump yards on the roads. Delhi's 24-hour air quality index measures the concentration of harmful pollutants. Anything over 300 is considered hazardous and New Delhi's levels are as high as 470. The government is attempting to take stricter measures to tackle air quality as there are major health concerns for citizens in India.  We'll hear more now from Vedika Sud, a CNN reporter based at the New Delhi bureau who will introduce us to some of the people impacted by the poor air quality and explain the science behind the toxic air. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  Seventy-two-year-old shopkeeper Narayan Choudhary suffers from chronic asthma. He says he almost died in April this year after the landfill behind his house which is the size of a village caught fire.  NARAYAN CHOUDHARY, SHOPKEEPER (through translator):  It was a massive blade. It was difficult to survive. My face and nose started swelling. I was gasping for breath. I could barely drink or eat. SUD:  Choudhary says had it not been for his friend who rushed him to hospital, he wouldn't be here today. It was a dangerous combination of methane, unsegregated garbage and record high temperatures earlier this year that sparked massive fires not only at the Bhalswa landfill but also here at one of Asia's biggest dump sites. Government data from 2019 says this Ghazipur landfill is almost stories tall and the size of s soccer fields. Methane is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas and one company GHGSat found on a single day in March as trash decomposed more than two metric tons of methane gas leaked every hour from the Ghazipur landfill. STEPHANE GERMAIN, CEO, GHGSAT:  When we take all the measurements that we took over a period of about a year, we found that the total emissions were equivalent to emissions from approximately 350,000 U.S. passenger vehicles per year. SUD:  And methane emissions aren't the only hazard. Dangerous toxins from landfills seep into the ground polluting the water supply for thousands of residents living nearby. That's the color of the water, a pale, dirty yellow and we're barely hundred meters away from the foothill of the landfill. In May, CNN commissioned two accredited labs to test the groundwater around the Bhalswa landfill. The result, the groundwater within at least a 500-  meter radius around the wayside is contaminated. According to the labs, it's unfit for drinking.  In the first lab report, the total dissolves solids from all three samples were off the charts. Amid other parameters, levels of ammonia and sulfate was significantly higher than acceptable limits mandated by the Indian government. Results from the second lab report were equally worrying. Also iron traces in the first sample for both lab reports were at least eight times more than the permissible limit. And while authorities bring in a supply of clean water, residents say they're simply not enough for this densely populated neighborhood, and that they must buy and consume purified water.  As part of his Clean India Initiative, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said efforts are being made to remove these mountains of garbage and convert them into green zones. That goal if achieved could stem the suffering of those residents living in the shadows of these dump sites and go a long way to curb the massive amounts of methane being released into the atmosphere.  With more than 3,100 landfills, the task is monumental and so far unrealized. And if decisive action isn't taken soon, the consequences on the global climate fight could be catastrophic and the toll on human life unimaginable. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In what U.S. city would you find the famous museum complex nickname "the nation's attic"? New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles or Raleigh? The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. is home to 19 museums, 21 libraries and is home to over 154 million eclectic holdings. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Up next, we're traveling to Raleigh, North Carolina, to show you how big tech is making that city one of the fastest growing in the United States. Raleigh even gained the recognition as the Smithsonian of the South because of its booming art scene and all the free museums you can choose from. Let's check it out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  If you were to list the great art and educational centers of the U.S., you might think of New York or D.C. But you might be missing one, here, Raleigh, North Carolina. Raleigh has long been a museum Mecca with a vibrant art scene. Now, big companies like Google and Apple are moving into the area, helping to make it one of the fastest growing cities in the U.S. And as the city's grown, Raleigh has gained more recognition as a cultural destination. The area boasts more than locally owned art galleries, over 60 performing art spaces, and 140 pieces of public art in the downtown area, not to mention over 50 historic sites and 17 museums, most of which are free, leading some people to call Raleigh and its abundance of cultural institutions the Smithsonian of the south. VALERIE HILLINGS, DIRECTOR AND CEO, NORTH CAROLINA MUSEUM OF ART:  The state of North Carolina from the 20th century realized what an important thing it was to offer to its citizens free museums, giving everyone an opportunity to learn about and experience different subjects. We opened our doors in 1956. REPORTER:  The North Carolina museum of arts collection stretches across different cultures and eras. It has dedicated galleries to Rodin, Jewish ceremonial art. It even has an infinity mirror room sculpture by Yayoi Kusama, who has been nicknamed the most Instagramed artist in the world. HILLINGS:  As I like to say, all art is once contemporary and all art becomes history. We began to move single artworks around into other galleries, unexpected galleries, that really changed how people saw this collection. One of the Wileys has been a real fan favorite as it's been paired with an earlier portrait of King Louis showing two young men having a great sense of swagger., REPORTER:  The museum also has the largest connected art park in the country, at a whopping 164 acres. HILLINGS:  It becomes like an outdoor art gallery. REPORTER:  The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences is the largest of its kind in the Southeast and home to millions of plants animals gems and to the second biggest earth on Earth. CHRIS SMITH, COORDINATOR OF CURRENT SCIENCE PROGRAMS, NC MUSEUM OF NATURALK SCIENCES:  It's accurate down to the most minute detail. There's a lot of great ways to get close to nature here at the museum and a lot of great ways to learn about what's going on in the state of North Carolina.  One of the main highlights, the reasons to come visit are the whale skeletons. That whale the Smithsonian tried to take it and we were like no, we want it. These are dinosaurs that would have lived in prehistoric North Carolina. This is an eastern glass lizard and very active this morning good to see him out. There are 50 states, North Carolina is the best because North Carolina has a little bit of everything that everybody loves. REPORTER:  Whether you're interested in history, modern art or even Harley- Davidson drag racing, Raleigh's got you covered. HILLINGS:  Many of the things you can see not only in New York but at museums worldwide, you can see here in North Carolina. But also you can see things you won't see anywhere else.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANNOUNCER:  Five, four, stage engine start, three, two, one -- booster's ignition and liftoff of Artemis I. We rise together back to the moon and beyond. (END VIDEO CLIP) COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Happy Thursday, everyone, or as I like to say happy Friday eve. I'm Coy. Thankful to be hanging out with you. Time for the best 10 minutes in news right here on CNN 10. Let's rise together. We start today with the liftoff of the rocket we just saw. Yesterday, NASA launching its long-awaited Artemis moon rocket. The mission was a long time and a lot of money coming. NASA has spent more than billion dollars to date getting Artemis off the ground. But there were scrubbed launches hurricanes and mechanical issues that delayed takeoff for months. But the rocket finally got off the ground. This mission kicks off a key test of America's ability to send astronauts back to the moon. Can you believe the last time humans were on the moon was way back in 1972? That's 50 years ago. But hold on a moon-it, there won't be any humans on the moon just yet. There's no crew for this expedition. The rocket will come within 60 miles of the lunar surface before flying forty thousand miles beyond the moon and then looping back to Earth over three weeks' time. The journey will conclude with a splash when the rocket lands at sea on December 11th. We're going to hear now from CNN's space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher about the first test flight of the Artemis moon rocket. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT:  This is, of course, an uncrewed first test flight for the Artemis moon rocket. It is a SLS rocket, the space launch system rocket, with the Orion crew capsule on top. And so, what we've seen over the last few hours is launch and then the capsule separating from the rocket, and the rocket falling back to earth. And now, this little capsule, the Orion capsule, is now making its way to the moon. It's going to take about five or six days to get there. When it gets there, it's going to fly by very close to the moon just about feet off the lunar surface before then traveling farther out into space than any spacecraft ever designed to carry humans has ever flown, before flying back to earth testing out that all-important heat shield at the base of the Orion capsule before splashing down into the ocean. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia, Thanksgiving themed. What type of food was definitely not present in 1600s New England when Pilgrims first arrived? Cranberries, pumpkin, potatoes or corn? Potatoes which are native to South America hadn't been introduced to North America yet. They weren't established crops there until the 1700s. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Officially, one week away from Thanksgiving now. What's your favorite thanksgiving side dish mashed potatoes cream corn cornbread or stuffing or dressing as some folks like to call it? Whatever you love, be sure to really love and appreciate it this Thanksgiving. Because due to inflation, Thanksgiving dinner will cost 20 percent more this year than last, and that was already considered the most expensive Thanksgiving ever. We'll hear now from chief business correspondent Christine Romans on what you and your families can expect at the grocery store this holiday season. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  On the menu this year for Thanksgiving, rising prices. Overall, prices are up 7.7 percent from last year and grocery prices are more than 12 percent higher than a year ago. Here's what it means for the family grocery bill as you shop for the big day. First, the turkey. Per pound prices for turkey are up 17 percent year-  over-year. An average frozen turkey costs roughly $2.38 cents a pound. That's up from a $1.74. Now you can blame the avian flu outbreaks and hire fuel feed and labor costs because of inflation running near 40-year highs. What about eggs? Eggs cost 43 percent more than a year ago. Butter and margarine are up 33 percent. Flour is up nearly 25 percent. Your pies are going to cost more to make. These higher prices could potentially change Thanksgiving plans. A new Wells Fargo report suggests some Americans may opt to eat out rather than shop and cook at home this year. Dining out also can be cost the report says, but it may be a better value than one might expect. Government data backs that up year over year the cost of dining out rose at a slower pace than the cost of a typical grocery store run. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Speaking of Thanksgiving grubbing, one of the best parts is eating leftovers in my opinion like for days and days, right? But we all know some people get skeezed out by that. Did you know though that the United States wastes 108 billion pounds of food each year? Well, maybe it doesn't have to be like that. CNN reported on the science behind food storage with expert tips on how to best store your food and to keep your leftovers from going bad. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  The kitchen is the heart of our homes and fortress for our fresh food. Taking pride of place, these gleaming apples and bananas might look safe now, but when you open the fridge or cupboards a few days later, you can find your once fresh ingredients in a very different condition. And this often comes down to how you put them away in the first place. BRITTANY TOWERS LEWIS, FOOD SCIENTIST:  A lot of food is wasted. People buy in bulk and then end up not eating it. REPORTER:  So much food in fact that if food loss and waste were a country it would be the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases. To keep food for longer and help the planet and your household budget in the process, there are a few things to keep in mind. LEWIS:  One is time. So obviously the longer you keep something, it will eventually go bad. Oxygen, there's a lot of reactions that happen if you've heard of oxidation. That kind of causes apples to go brown, for example when you cut them. Moisture can increase microbial growth, which is something that we want to prevent because obviously bacteria, molds, light can also cause foods to spoil a little faster. Like potatoes, they're exposed to light. They can turn green. They produce sprouts for example. REPORTER:  So, to avoid waking up to potatoes like this, you should keep them in a cool dark place, in a breathable bag to avoid moisture, and away from fruits such as bananas. This is because bananas are climacteric foods which means they produce a lot of ethylene. LEWIS:  Ethylene, very fancy term. It's a gas that causes fruits and vegetables to ripen. That's why a lot of times when people are like, hey, you want to ripen something put it in a bag with a banana, because bananas produce a lot of ethylene. So, it'll cause it to ripen faster. REPORTER:  Salad leaves are another victim of bad storage, resulting in this all too familiar kitchen scene. LEWIS:  If you notice kind of your leaves aren't lasting as long a really great way is to rinse them off and make sure they're completely dry. Vinegar not only will help kill or monitor bacteria but it's also very acidic. So, most bacteria also don't like acidic environments. REPORTER:  And remember the role moisture plays. LEWIS:  Bacteria love water and that's what they use to grow. So, the more water you try to take out, the longer that they last. So, if you put a little paper towel in, keep it in your refrigerator, that will help keep the lettuce a little longer. REPORTER:  But when it comes to herbs, a little H20 used correctly goes a long way. LEWIS:  If you cut the bottom stem part off and kind of put them in some water, in your refrigerator, that can help keep them a little longer. They're like a living plant. So, they're in their little water and they're drinking it up, instead of in like a bag from the grocery store that kind of just like harbors just bacteria because everything's like stuck together. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10 is fantastic. Scientists discovering never seen before deep sea creatures at the bottom of the Indian Ocean near the Cocos Islands, an Australian territory. These fish are freaky. There's a deep-sea batfish looking like a baby Yoda thingy. And then this previously unknown species of blind eel. I mean, it makes me wonder what else could be down there or do we even want to know? All right. All my so-fish-ticated folks, it's about that time. I want to give a special shout-out to Marianna High School in Marianna, Florida. We see you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. We made it to the weekend. Friday's rock especially when they lead into a nice long holiday vacation. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and we are pumped to be right here with you to finish this week strong. We're starting today by concluding our months-long coverage of the midterm elections. Let's reflect. On November 8th, Americans cast their votes for representatives in Congress which consists of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, and they also voted for candidates for state and local offices. The elections are called midterms because they happen in the middle of a president's four-year term. After a close race and days of counting ballots Democrats retained the Senate, while Republicans won the House of Representatives. This means Republicans can stop a significant portion of President Biden's Democratic agenda. Remember, Congress makes nationwide laws. The House decides which laws are voted on. The Senate can approve or block them and confirm appointments made by the president. The candidates who won their position will take office this January so we won't see any changes until then. Pretty soon, the next batch of candidates will start campaigning for the elections in 2024 where the big race will be for president of the United States. We'll be here through the whole process updating you on the latest with no opinion or slant, just the facts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What country will host the 2022 World Cup? Japan, France, Qatar or Australia? The Middle Eastern nation of Qatar will host the 2022 international soccer tournament which kicks off on Sunday. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  The World Cup, it's one of the most popular sporting events of all time. Every four years, the best players from across the planet represent their nations in an epic soccer tournament. The world cup kicking off this Sunday in Qatar is the men's tournament. The women's is next year, and more than one million people are expected to travel to Qatar. That's more than a third of the nation's entire population. This year's tourney has been described though as the "World Cup of chaos". For the first time ever, it's not being played in the traditional summer months because for the first time ever, it's in the Middle East where the Qatari desert would have been scorching hot during that time. So, players in top leagues across the world are having to play this World Cup in the middle of their club seasons, meaning they'll be exhausted. Also, the country of Qatar has been criticized for its human rights record. More now from CNN anchor and correspondent Isa Soares. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEPP BLATTER, FORMER FIFA PRESIDENT:  The winner to organize the 2022 FIFA World Cup is Qatar. ISA SOARES, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The sports world was stunned when FIFA awarded the World Cup to Qatar. Controversy took center stage and football risked becoming a sideshow. Why was Qatar, a tiny desert state with no football pedigree, chosen to host FIFA's showpiece event? Even the disgraced former chief of football's governing body has since described the decision as a mistake. BLATTER:  I was right at a certain time to say it is -- we should not go there. SOARES:  That move, 12 years ago, provoked unprecedented anger, accusations of corruption, and sportswashing. Qatari officials strongly denied the allegation that bribery was involved in their bid. Before a ball is kicked at the year's tournament, attention has focused on Qatar's human rights record. Its stance on same-sex relationship, and most damaging to its reputation, the treatment of overseas workers drafted in to build essential infrastructure. Amnesty International claims authorities failed to properly investigate the deaths of thousands of migrant workers despite evidence linking premature deaths with unsafe working conditions in the searing heat. Qatari officials say they investigate all reports of abuse and exploitation and are committed to holding unscrupulous employers to account. When the final whistle goes at Qatar 2022, the legacy will be judged not only over 28 days of football but in the years that lie ahead. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, this is a sad and uncertain time for many people across the tech industry. Many workers are scrambling to seek new opportunities. Fears of recession, rising interest rates and a shift to pre-pandemic lifestyles have all dealt major blows to the tech industry. More than 35,000 tech workers across 72 companies have been laid off just this month, for a total of 120,000 tech jobs lost this year. We'll hear now from CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich who has more on the future of the industry. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In three weeks, the tech industry lost tens of thousands of jobs. Historic layoffs at Twitter, Meta, Lyft and Amazon. Layoffs.fyi, a crowdsourced layoff tracking site, puts it at more than 35,000 layoffs so far this month. ROGER LEE, FOUNDER, LAYOFFS.FYI:  That's the highest month since the pandemic. So that beats April 2020, which was 17,000 employees laid off. YURKEVICH:  Meta cut its workforce by 13 percent. CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying he's taking accountability and apologizing to those impacted. New owner Elon Musk slashed half of Twitter staff with founder Jack Dorsey tweeting: The company grew too quickly, I apologize for that. And Amazon is laying off ten thousand workers this week, citing an unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment. NELA RICHARDSON, CHIEF ECONOMIS, ADP RESEARCH INSTITUTE:  There were big investments made during the pandemic time while the rest of the economy for example was plummeting by 3.4 percent. Tech grew by four percent. YURKEVICH:  But in a post-pandemic high inflation world, consumer behaviors and spending habits are changing, with the threat of recession on the horizon. RICHARDSON:  I take this as a sign that maybe companies got over their skis at some point right and they're trying to kind of sit upright again. YURKEVICH:  Roger Lee founded layoffs.fyi as the pandemic unfolded. Recently, he's been digging deeper into the numbers. LEE:  There have been many companies who have been letting go half or more of their recruiting HR teams just because they're not hiring as many people anymore. YURKEVICH:  Aaron Backman, a recruiter at a tech company, was one of those layoffs. What did that feel like for you? AARON BACKMAN, LAID OFF FROM TECH COMPANY:  It was a really awful feeling. We were told really early in the morning an email saying layoffs are coming today. And if you get a call, it's going to be you. And I sat there for six hours on slack and watched my colleagues get laid off one by one. YURKEVICH:  Then he got the call. BACKMAN:  It's depressing. YURKEVICH:  As American workers watch tech giants shed jobs at a rapid clip, many in other industries are asking, am I next? Should they be nervous? RICHARDSON:  First of all, the tech economy are just two percent of the labor market. Tech is an important part of the economy but it is not the whole of the economy. The rest of the labor market is looking pretty good. The economy is adding jobs at a pretty healthy clip. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's out 10 of 10 is quite relephant to what we do here at CNN 10.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, everyone?  Hope you had an awesome break and had some time to reflect on the things for which you are thankful, something for which I'm grateful is all of you and I am pumped to be right back at it so we can finish 2022 strong together, just 34 days remain in this year. We start today with news out of China. Protests have erupted all across the country, citizens taking to the streets in an unprecedented challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping's zero COVID policy. Hundreds of people in China shouting the phrases "Step down, Xi Jinping. Step down, communist party", and "Don't want COVID test, want freedom". The Chinese government has faced mounting anger at its zero COVID policy which attempts to isolate every case of COVID in the country and shut down the surrounding areas. Even almost three years into the pandemic, COVID tests, incessant lockdowns and quarantines have plagued the country. The protocols have kept China's infection rate lower than countries like the United States. The government, though, faces complaints about the economic and human cost as citizens are isolated for weeks at a time with limited access to food and medicine, while the country suffers economically.  A deadly fired an apartment block in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, killed 10 people and injured nine more on Thursday. After the event video suggested that COVID lockdown measures delayed firefighters from reaching the victims. The incident has been a further catalyst to the widespread anger and defiance against the government, which is rarely seen in China, a country where the communist party cracks down on all dissent. We'll hear more now from CNN international correspondent Selina Wang based at the network's Beijing bureau with more on this movement. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Anger is rising and tragedies are mounting but China shows no sign of budging on zero COVID. Authorities are clamping down with more lockdowns, mass testing and quarantine, and people are getting more and more frustrated. Adding to the anger is a fire that broke out in the capital of China's far west Xinjiang region on Thursday night. Ten people were killed and nine were injured in a fire at an apartment building in Urumqi.  Most parts of Xinjiang have been under lockdown for more than a hundred days. The deadly fire sparked nationwide outrage because widely circulated videos which have now been censored in China show that COVID measures, COVID lockdown measures very likely delayed firefighters from getting to the scene.  Now, state media claims that people in the compound were allowed to leave the building, that it was considered a low-risk COVID area. But video shows fire trucks unable to get close to the scene because the compound entrance was partially blocked. The video shows it's blocked with fences tents and metal barriers that are normally used as part of COVID measures.  The videos also show smoke and flames coming from a high floor of the building but the water failing to actually reach the fire. What adds to the tragedy is that those who died in the fire likely spent their last three months largely confined to that building if not entirely.  The fire really struck a cord with the public here because we've seen scenes of tragedy and suffering play out over and over again since the start of the pandemic. Countless stories of people struggling to get enough food daily necessities and emergency care and lockdown three years into these draconian policies, frustrations are more frequently turning into public protests which are normally rare and authoritarian China.  Last week, in the southern city of Guangzhou, some residents revolted during lockdown by tearing down barriers and marching through the streets. There were violent clashes at the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou this week. But still, there's no end in sight to zero COVID. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What type of star is the sun? Yellow Dwarf, Neutron Star, Red Dwarf, or Supernova? According to NASA, the sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old Yellow Dwarf star, at the center of our solar system. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next up, we'll hear how Heliogen, a renewable energy company in California's Mojave Desert, is using concentrated sunlight to power more than just your home. This new tech startup wants to replace fossil fuels with concentrated sunlight. But unlike traditional green energy suppliers, this startup is able to store fuel to create power even when it's dark outside or cloudy.  But while the company has major financial backers, it's not a perfect solution. Stock prices are low and some question whether Heliogen can execute on a large scale. We'll hear now from CNN business producer Jon Sarlin. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JON SARLIN, CNN BUSINESS PRODUCER (voice-over):  In California's Mojave Desert, renewable energy company Heliogen is working to harness concentrated sunlight for more than just powering your home. Using artificial intelligence, these mirrors can produce the extremely high temperatures needed to make things like concrete, steel and green hydrogen. So behind you are these mirrors reflecting light. Tell me what they're -- what are they doing? BILL GROSS, FOUNDER AND CEO, HELIOGEN:  We're taking a field of mirrors. Each one of them being moved precisely by computer algorithms to reflect the sunlight to a single spot up on the tower behind us. At that single spot, we're achieving temperatures that are almost a third the temperature of the surface of the sun.  SARLIN:  What do you turn what these mirrors are projecting into? GROSS:  The end result is we get very high temperatures so we can make steam for heavy industry, we can melt aluminum, we can melt steel, we can make concrete.  SARLIN:  It's the algorithm that separates Heliogen from other concentrated solar power ventures. Heliogen doesn't need complex mirrors. Instead, they use cameras and computing power to align their mirrors to reflect sunlight onto a refinery tower. This process creates temperatures of about a thousand degrees Celsius and all of that heat is directed and stored in big thermos-like containers. GROSS:  So the energy continues after the sun goes down or even on cloudy days. We hold enough energy for a week of no sunshine, so that industry can run 24/7.  SARLIN:  Concentrated solar power is a renewable energy resource that's been around for decades to generate power, but with mixed success. Its primary disadvantage has always been the hours of the day the sun isn't shining.  Heliogen's process solves this problem by storing its heat and making green fuel like hydrogen that can be used to fuel electric generating stations. Okay. So you have this concentrated light source. You're using it for power, for industrial uses, and for what else? GROSS:  Because we have continuous electricity. We can make hydrogen. So hydrogen is a miracle substance. It's the most common element on earth.  SARLIN:  Heliogen is using the thermal energy it creates to make hydrogen. Ironically, most hydrogen is made using fossil fuels, which has limited its production. What Heliogen is doing is making the process of creating a clean fuel clean. GROSS:  We already moved a molecule all over the earth in the form of oil and gas. Hydrogen is also a molecule which we can transport. So why is that so important? The United States can be an energy exporter, a renewable energy exporter. SARLIN:  So are we there yet? GROSS:  We're there. This is happening. Where we really need hydrogen is for trucks, for airplanes, for long distance transportation. All the places where hydrogen is made right now in a dirty way, we're going to make it in a clean way.  SARLIN:  So the question though is if we can do it, we can do it in the lab. But can we do it on scale? GROSS:  We are doing it at scale. That's what you're looking at here. SARLIN:  At scale? GROSS:  At scale. This is a scale technology with a multi-acre field gathering the sunlight from multiple acres, concentrating it, and using that high temperature energy to split water and make hydrogen. SARLIN:  The company has major backers like Bill Gates. But still, Heliogen has faced obstacles. Your stock price has faltered over the last year. Is the business at where you want it to be? GROSS:  Absolutely. In all businesses, your timing has to be perfect. So what's happened in the last year or so that makes the timing perfect? Well, fossil fuel prices have tripled. So all of a sudden, you can go to business and say, I'm going to install a system for you that takes away the volatility, you'll have control over your own energy production and I'm going to meet or beat your price and with zero emissions.  The sun is a resource that no one owns. It gives us ten thousand times more energy than the whole humanity needs and it's available for everybody. So the innovation can happen everywhere.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. And we've got a rendezvous with the news, so let's go. We're going to begin with news on the economy regarding the most wonderful time of the year, the holiday season, traditionally a big season for shopping as well. This year, many shoppers are returning to their pre- pandemic routines, going back nearly three years now. Shoppers are expected to shop big around some key dates like Black Friday last week, but they're also predicted to make major purchases later in the shopping season, hoping to land deals.  This year, inflation has limited many shoppers budgets though. But retailer experts say that customers are pulling back on discretionary spending like furniture and electronics and are being more selective about what they buy. Many Americans are dipping into their savings accounts and racking up debt to make purchases as well. They're also utilizing services like buy now pay later, which is a type of installment loan people might use instead of a traditional credit card. Let's break it down by the numbers. Online, Black Friday sales in the United States topped a record-breaking $9 billion this year, and were over two percent higher compared to last year. U.S. shoppers spent a record $5.29 billion on Thanksgiving Day, up nearly 3 percent from a year ago.  Experts are predicting that American shoppers spent more than $9.5 billion across Saturday and Sunday, and that Monday will be the biggest online shopping day again, growing more than five percent from last year to $11 billion. But some of that growth reflects higher prices, not necessarily higher volume, due to inflation this year. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSIENESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  On this year's holiday shopping menu, more sales but with a healthy side of inflation. DENISE SALLETTE, HOLIDAY SHOPPER:  Cutting off your circulation. I'm going crazy. YURKEVICH:  Denise Sallette is in the middle of her holiday shopping at Willowbrook Mall in Wayne, New Jersey.  SALLETTE:  This is for my mom. And then I got stuff for my kids and my niece and, oh my God.  YURKEVICH:  This year, the wish list is looking a little different. Last month, inflation cooled but was still running hot at 7.7 percent year-over-  year. SALLETTE:  I've had a cutback on shopping because things are too expensive. I mean, I do have three girls. They do understand that, you know, times are hard right now and it's just me being a single mom. YURKEVICH:  Despite high inflation, the National Retail Federation estimates that nearly 8 million more people will shop between Black Friday and Cyber Monday and spend up to eight percent more this year than they did last year. MATTHEW SHAY, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL RETAIL FEDERATION:  We're looking at records in all categories. It is remarkable in the face of the cost and the price pressures that consumers are still finding a way to increase their spending power the economy, drive economic activity. YURKEVICH:  Last month, retail sales beat expectations, up 1.3 percent in October. But this month, consumer sentiment fell. Still, higher prices haven't stopped some people from shopping. Has that impacted the way you're going to spend this holiday season? CYNTHIA PENDELTON, HOLIDAY SHOPPER: For me, not really because I try not to overspend anyways. So even before this is going on, I try not to exceed what I can do.  YURKEVICH:  And according to the National Retail Federation, while online sales are expected to increase this year, a return to in-store shopping will make up a larger portion of all holiday sales. PENDELTON:  I kind of like in person more. YURKEVICH:  You do wise up. PENDELTON:  I don't know. It's just more of the feel of being able to touch it, being able to see it, being able to try it on for the stores that you allow to, and then being amongst everybody else. YURKEVICH:  It's that holiday nostalgia that Willowbrook Mall says will help this year's shopping season return to pre-pandemic expectations. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What group of islands is the most isolated population center in the world? The Galapagos, The Solomon Islands, Hawaii, or The British Isles? Answer is Hawaii. Surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the U.S. state is over 2,000 miles from California, nearly 4,000 miles from Japan. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Up next, the world's largest active volcano. The Mauna Loa in Hawaii, it's erupting for the first time in nearly years. The eruption is prompting an ash fall advisory for Hawaii's big island and surrounding waters.  The good news, there's no evacuation notice at this time. Lava flows are contained in the summit area and are not threatening to harm downslope communities according to the Hawaii Volcano Observatory.  The bad news is asphalt from the volcano could damage vehicles and buildings, contaminate water supplies, disrupt sewage and electrical systems. It could even damage or kill vegetation.  Mauna Loa has erupted 33 times since 1843 and covers half of the island of Hawaii and it's only 21 miles west of one of the most active volcanoes in the world, Kilauea, which is also currently erupting. When it erupted in 2018, it destroyed more than 700 homes. All right. From lava to dragon eggs. There's new drone technology that's improving an effective technique used to prevent wildfires, right? But it might not be what you think, not a soaring fire extinguisher or a water dropping drone. They're drones that drop fire in the form of, quote, dragon eggs to perform something called prescribed burning or starting a fire in order to avoid one later.  But some experts say that the technique is dangerous for firefighters. CNN business producer Jon Sarlin is here with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JON SARLIN, CNN BUSINESS PRODUCER:  This fireball-dropping drones are improving one of the oldest and most effective ways of preventing extreme wildfires, prescribed burning. CARRICK DETWEILER, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, DRONE AMPLIFIED:  Prescribed fires basically work by doing a very low intensity burn that will burn up the dead leaves and sticks that would cause major wildfires when they dry out later in the summer. We can reduce these huge wildfires by using more fire when it's safe to do so. SARLIN:  Many experts say prescribed burning should be used more often but it can be dangerous for firefighters.  DETWEILER:  They're often hiking out into the middle of mountains with a drip torch or they're riding an ATV and then you have helicopters with the whole crew on board flying really low and slow over the fire about a quarter of all while then firefighting fatalities are related to aviation. And for me, this really was a motivation to get these systems into the hands of firefighters. SARLIN:  Robotics researcher Carrick Detweiler started his company Drone Amplified to make prescribed fires safer, easier, and less expensive. DETWEILER:  Our system doesn't cover the amount of area that a helicopter can, but you can deploy tens or hundreds of our systems for the same cost as a helicopter. SARLIN:  On a 50-pound drone, Carrick secures a device that can carry 400 fireballs that ignite when they land on the ground.  DETWEILER:  We call these dragon eggs. They have potassium permanganate when you mix it with glycol, it starts a chemical reaction and a fire. SARLIN:  The drones allow firefighters to work at a distance from the flames and areas difficult to reach due to terrain or visibility. DETWEILER:  And this is really doubling the amount of time that firefighters can fight the fire when it's dark, when it's smoky, when other airplanes can't be out there. You can drop the balls in specific locations and this lets you do much more precise burns. SARLIN:  Precision is important, because even though prescribed burn escapes are extremely rare, the outcome can be devastating.  Two recent controlled burns in New Mexico led to the state's largest wildfire on record. DETWEILER:  Our system can help prevent escaped fires through the use of thermal cameras. You can see through smoke and look for any fires outside of the fire boundary. Our app also allows the firefighter to put in geofences to precisely control where the fire is starting and this lets the firefighters actually control the intensity of the fire. SARLIN:  Carrick says a hundred of their drone systems are now working for clients like the U.S. Forest Service and other federal agencies. But in the future, they envisioned similar systems in the back of every firefighter's truck. DETWEILER:  When firefighters are widely deploying these, we'll really be able to get up to doing more prescribed fire that's needed to mitigate these wildfires. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, we're taking a journey to the far side of the moon, and it all starts with a selfie. NASA's Orion spacecraft snapped a selfie as it approached the moon. The spacecraft was eight days into its and a half day mission at the time. The journey will go more than forty thousand miles beyond the far side of the moon and if Orion completes its journey, it'll be the farthest a spacecraft intended to carry humans has ever traveled. This selfie was snapped with a camera, on one of the capsule's solar panels. Pretty cool if I do say so myselfie.  And now on to my favorite part of the day. Special shout out to Calhoun Middle School in Denton, Texas. We see you.  Today, November 29th is Giving Tuesday. Every year on a Tuesday after Thanksgiving, people take time to give back.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, everyone? It's Wednesday. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and you are awesome. We're going to start today with a follow-up on the World Cup being played in the Middle Eastern country of Qatar. Yesterday was a huge soccer match between the USA and Iran, not just because it was a win or go home match for USA or that it was a win or draw or go home for Iran, but because of the political talking points surrounding the match. Some World Cup teams have been showing solidarity with anti-regime protesters in Iran who are fighting for women's rights. Some Iranian players even refrained from singing the national anthem ahead of their first match to show solidarity with protesters. But things really got heated when the U.S. Soccer Federation altered the Iranian flag on one of their graphics online, removing the Islamic emblem from the center of it. As a result, Iran called for FIFA, the World Cup organizers, to ban Team USA from the World Cup. That didn't happen, all this adding attention ahead of the match. Players from both sides while they do care about issues outside of sport, they really want to just focus on the game and their dream of playing in a World Cup. On Tuesday, the match finally arrived, and CNN correspondent Andy Scholes was at a watch party to take in the action. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDY SCHOLES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The party is on here in the U.S. at Fado Irish pub in Atlanta, Georgia, as Team USA is moving on. They had only scored one goal since June and that was against Wales last week, in their opening game of the World Cup. The fans here tense, waiting for the goal because they had to win the game. A tie wouldn't cut it this time around. And into the 38th minute, this place just exploded when Christian Pulisic came through with that goal to give the USA the 1-0 lead. They would hold on to win by that final score and they are now moving on to face the Netherlands. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was incredible. I thought we played the first half brilliantly. Towards the end, I was a little scared when we went defensive. But in the end, it all worked out. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So proud, so ready to the next round. I think we're going to kill it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This team is young, they're hungry, they don't 90 stop minutes strong. We got through it today. So happy, unbelievable win for the USA. Let's go baby all the way. SCHOLES:  And, Coy, as you can see this win meant so much for Team USA and their fans. And, hey, the good news is we get to do it all over again on Saturday. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. As we mentioned yesterday, the world's largest active volcano, Mauna Loa in Hawaii, has erupted for the first time in nearly years. Its neighbor, the Kilauea volcano, sits just 21 miles away and it began erupting more than a year ago. So, this rare dual eruption is expected to attract visitors from all over the world actually. Next, we're traveling to Hawaii with senior national correspondent Sara Sidner who recently flew over volcanoes in Hawaii to get a better understanding of the changing landscape and the science behind and under volcanoes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA SIDNER, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  As the sun rises each morning here in Hilo, Hawaii, it reveals destruction and creation happening simultaneously at the heart of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. I witnessed this from new heights with pilot and volcano expert Samantha Hanson. From up above, the full scale of volcanic activity is clear. SAMANTHA HANSON, PILOT:  If you look out here across the horizon, you see all these like little mini mountains out here, and these are all cinder cones. So, they're almost like many volcanoes right on the side of the big volcano. This whole thing right here that we're flying over right now, this is Mauna Loa. This is the largest volcano on the planet. SIDNER:  You really see how the lava spread out. HANSON:  Yeah. SIDNER:  I mean, it's very apparent. HANSON:  If you were to cut the island in half, it would look like Swiss cheese. It's just riddled with these lava tubes. As the island gets bigger and bigger, right, there's lava tubes, kind of, you know, build on each other. SIDNER:  But most of the volcano isn't what you see here. It's underwater where eruptions can and do occur, like the massive explosion in the waters off Tonga, just one of the over potentially active volcanoes worldwide, capable of creating earthquakes, tsunamis and entirely reshaping the landscape. One of the most devastating eruptions in Hawaii happened here in 2018 at Mount Kilauea where we joined volcanologist Kendra Lynn. KENDRA LYNN, VOLCANOLOGIST, U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY:  This was most significant collapse event that's really been recorded and observed since Western visitors arrived at the volcano. SIDNER:  Lava at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit crept across the island oozed over homes and roads and burst out of fissures. The eruption went on for over 100 days, destroying more than 700 homes and forcing thousands to evacuate. That one event dramatically changed the landscape. LYNN:  Here at the summit, almost daily, there was a magnitude earthquake as all of these rocks just started to collapse in on themselves and create the new crater. Which are kind of larger. SIDNER:  And the destruction brought a new course of exploration for Kendra, the study of rocks and how they form. LYNN:  We often looked to the rock record and the different types of rocks that are preserved around the volcano to understand past behavior. We look for patterns that might clue us into how the volcano will behave in the future. SIDNER:  Is there any prediction as to when the next eruption might be or what it's going to look like? LYNN:  It's difficult to say when, but we do know for sure that it will happen again someday. SIDNER:  Scientists are working hard to determine just how catastrophic that eruption might be. MICHAEL NEWMAN, PARK RANGER, HAWAII VOLCANOES NATIONAL PARK:  What's really remarkable about Hawaii is that it's a living landscape. It's a place where the volcano breathes. We can see the steam breathing from the crater. We can feel the movement of the earth. We can see land being created as we speak, and it's a place where we can really become in touch with nature. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these American retailers started in 1886 as a watch company? Sears, Target, Big Lots, or Costco? Considered to be the Amazon or Walmart of its day, Sears went on to become one of America's biggest retailers. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Once America's largest retailer and business employer, with an extensive retail network, Sears has struggled in the 21st century. It had more than 350,000 employees in 2006. But today, there are only 15 full-line Sears stores still open across the country and the company filed for bankruptcy years ago. We'll hear now from CNN's Rachel Crane on the slow demise of the iconic chain and how it was once both the Amazon and Walmart of its day. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RACHEL CRANE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Sears is in trouble, closing thousands of stores and losing billions of dollars. But once upon a time, Sears transformed the way Americans shopped. Back in the late 1800s in Minnesota, Richard Sears was spending his days as a railroad station agent, until one day, he sold some watches from a local jeweler and realized he was really good at selling. So, in 1886, he started a mail order company, the RW Sears Watch Company, and eventually hired a watchmaker Alva C. Roebuck. And in 1893, Sears Roebuck and Co. was born. Sears then became a very successful mail-order catalog company. This business model broke the mold. Remember, most Americans were living in small towns with access to only a few stores. They often made their own clothes and furniture or did without. Sears early catalogs only featured watches and jewelry. But soon these catalogs were more than 500 pages long, people could buy anything, from shoes, wagons, stoves and musical instruments. Sometimes, people even bought their homes directly from Sears. And because Sears bought in bulk, the company was able to charge customers lower prices. In 1925, Sears opened its first retail location in Chicago, and it wasn't just retail. Sears had a radio station, a mortgage business, a credit card. Sears was everywhere. Annual sales hit one billion dollars in 1945. The next year, sales doubled. Once Americans started to move to the booming suburbs after World War II, Sears began investing to help build malls. By 1970, Sears was considered untouchable by its rivals. But not all stories have a happy ending. As the 20th century came to a close, so did Sears' reign. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, check out this house.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Can you believe it's December 1st already? I swear it feels like it was just November yesterday. But no, just like that, only one month remaining in this year, so let's make it great. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we're starting with news out of China today, where protesters are taking to the streets in a rare display of defiance against the country's ruling communist party. The people are rising up against the zero COVID policy, a strategy that China has been using to limit the spread of COVID. But while the policy has kept China's virus levels lower than other large countries, it's placed millions of people under lockdown and quarantine, limiting their access to food medicine and family. It's also hurting the economy and restricting travel. Anger boiled over last week when a fire in an apartment building killed at least 10 people. Some believe the tragic deaths could have been prevented were it not for the anti-virus restrictions that may have prevented first responders from arriving more quickly. The authorities aren't messing around when it comes to shutting down the demonstrations and acts of defiance online as well. Hundreds of armored vehicles have been deployed to the streets. Authorities have vowed to, quote, strike hard if necessary. The number of people detained as a result of the resistance is not known at this time but the punishment for protesting in China can be severe. Senior international correspondent Ivan Watson has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  China's police state strikes back, flooding the streets of Beijing and Shanghai with police, an unmistakable show of force after a weekend of unprecedented protest in at least 15 cities across the country. In the eastern city of Hangzhou Monday night, police arrested people in a central square. And an eyewitness tells CNN police searched people's phones on the Shanghai subway, looking for apps that allow users to circumvent Shanghai's strict Internet censorship. The communist party's domestic security committee ordering officials to resolutely strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces, as well as criminal activities that destabilized social order. No compromise for peaceful protesters to voice their opinion. Meanwhile, health officials striking a slightly softer tone, calling for shorter lockdowns in the Chinese government campaign to eradicate COVID-19. CHENG YOUQUAN, CHINESE CTR. FOR DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION (through translator):  We need to minimize the inconvenience to the general public because of the anti-COVID-19 measures. As for the high-risk regions, we must have rigorous control. But at the same time, we should spare no effort to provide services to meet people's basic living needs and medical needs. WATSON:  A carrot and stick approach from different parts of the Chinese state, after the biggest nationwide display of discontent that this tightly controlled country has seen in a generation. Ivan Watson, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, we're going inside a cryptocurrency mine. Unlike the dollar, the euro, yen, franc or pound that you can put in your pocket, cryptocurrency is completely digital. It's created with encrypted computer algorithms. Many experts are quick to point out the issues with crypto, though, including market instability bankruptcies lawsuits and how it can actually harm the environment because the computers give off massive amounts of heat. That's why they're stored in crypto mines. We'll go now to northern Sweden with CNN reporter Anna Stewart who's found a mind that may be more sustainable for the environment if their plans to use the heat to grow things we can eat come to fruition. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER:  Well, this is what a crypto currency mine looks like the frozen rows of computers, in fact, there are 116,000 here. As you can hear, it sounds pretty noisy, and I can say that it feels really hot up close to these machines. There's about a 30 degrees centigrade difference though between here and here under one of the big bends where you're getting the cold air from outside. So, you can feel the energy that is coming out of these lots of power a small city, one of the reasons crypto mining can be just so controversial. But that is why Hive Blockchain Technologies have set up shops here in the north of Sweden. Come take a look why. Outside, some 500 meters along the River Lulea is a hydrogen power plant, a source of abundant cheap and renewable energy. JOHANNA THORNBLAD, PRESIDENT, HIVE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES:  This is the energy that is powering the Boden community and our data center that is located just nearby so this is also one of the main reasons that Hive has decided to bet on the Boden community. STEWART:  Given Europe is in an energy crisis, there will be people that think this is renewable energy. Should it be used for crypto mining? Shouldn't it be used to power people's homes and industry, keep lights on in hospitals? What do you say to them? THORNBLAD:  There are not enough inhabitants or companies to use all the energy that is available, so the community of Boden was inviting data centers to come to use this renewable stranded energy really. STEWART:  One crypto mining company is not just turning a profit in the midst of a crypto winter but also trying to forge a greener future, there are nearer term plans to turn the excess heat from the crypto mining into something more fruitful. THORNBLAD:  In the spring, we're going to support a Swedish company called Actira (ph). So they're building a huge, big greenhouse just at the back of our data center. And so, we will have tomatoes and cucumbers grown all year round in the very north of Sweden. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What is the geographical region at the base of South America which covers parts of Chile and Argentina? Colombia, Patagonia, Marmot, or North Face? Patagonia is your answer here, a nature lover's paradise where you could hike the Andes Mountains. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next, we head to Patagonia on the Chilean side, home to some of the most tantalizing topography and wondrous wildlife on the planet. The remote and rugged coastline region in south America is known for its gorgeous glaciers, beautiful lakes and rivers. But this region may be in danger. We'll meet Vreni Haussermann now, a marine biologist studying the wildlife in the region. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VRENI HAUSSERMANN, MARINE BIOLOGIST, SAN SEBASTIAN UNIVERSITY:  For me, Patagonia is the most beautiful part of Chile. It's a very remote, very wild and rugged coastline. Full of green forest, temperate rainforest, has lots of glaciers, rivers, lakes and the coast is very steep. The marine life came from deep waters but also from adjacent areas and so the diversity we find in fjords is elevated compared to other coastlines. My name is Vreni Haussermann. I'm a scientist working at the University of San Sebastian and I'm studying the marine biodiversity of Chilean Patagonia. Diving in Patagonia, we found many species that haven't been described before. The coastline is more than 100,000 kilometers, which is twice around the world. Only a handful of scientists working there. So even if we studied all the main areas, there are still most parts that we don't know yet. Chilean Patagonia was free of human impact for a long time, but in the '80s when aquaculture moved in, it started to be impacted. Life in the fjords has been reduced in abundance. There are species we hardly don't find anymore. By impacting an area where we know very little about, we always have the risk that we are damaging ecosystems and the equilibrium of the ecosystems is lost. I hope that humanity understands the need of protect our planet. I hope humanity understands the need of protecting the oceans and our lives and the lives of all future generations depend on a healthy ocean and a healthy planet. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, a reminder that it's never too late to right a wrong. In Minnesota, a library book was finally returned after being checked out 47 years ago. For decades, a Mercedes-Benz repair manual was missing from the shelves but earlier this month, it was mailed back with 200 bucks and an anonymous handwritten note saying that the sender had been fixing their car and although they probably couldn't afford the late fees maybe the library could buy a new book instead. Hope that dude finally got his car fixed. And you know I went to a bookstore the other day and saw a book called "How to End 50 Percent of Your Problems". So, I bought two. Shout out time now. Hanover Online School in Ashland, Virginia, thanks for subscribing typing and commenting on our YouTube channel. And thanks for all the love, @CoyWire on Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok. It is Thursday. So happy Friday eve people. My team and I are already working on a plan to finish this week strong with you right here on CNN 10. END221202

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. What a wonderful day. It's Friday and you already know Friday's rock. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, where we break down big news stories and easy to understand explanations with reporters all over the world, no opinion, no slant, just the news and we love having some fun with you. Starting with some good news today. Hurricane season is officially over in the United States. The hurricane season runs from June 1st to November 30th. And this season was notable for several reasons. One, it was calm the first half of the season. No hurricanes from July 3rd to the end of August, for the first time now since 1941. But the second half, three destructive hurricanes did hit the United States. Here's a breakdown: despite the slow start, there were 14 named storms, eight hurricanes, two of them major, registering category 3 or higher. Hurricanes Ian, Nicole and Fiona were among the most notable. Hurricane Ian made landfall as a category 4 storm, killing nearly 150 people, destroying homes and businesses. Tropical storm Ian also caused more than $50 billion in estimated damage. Several hundred Florida Keys residents marking the end of this hurricane season by gathering on Wednesday to celebrate. They burned hurricane warning flags. Some people though are still cleaning up damage left behind, mourning loved ones taken by storms. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In which of these U.S. states would you find a zip code that starts with a number 1? New York, California, Texas or Florida? Zip codes starting with a one represents New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next up, I want to introduce you to a very special principal who's empowering her students and defining her school's sense of pride. Principal Lisa Caldwell Linder from Brownsville neighborhood in Brooklyn came from what some would consider a rough neighborhood. But she always believed that she could rise above any of the negative aspects surrounding her and she did. Over time, she coined a phrase: "I am not my zip code". And she's using that phrase now to empower her students at her school and make them realize that they too can rise up higher than others might assume as possible. Meet Principal Lisa Caldwell Linder. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATHALY WARNER, FORMER ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL:  Ms. Linder sees natural abilities within people. KADIR ELLISON, FORMER STUDENT:  That's what I loved about her, that she just kept us on the right track. TRISTAN MILLS, JR., FORMER STUDENT, ASSISTANT BAND DIRECTOR:  Ms. Linder honestly gave me a safer environment. LISA CALDWELL LINDER, PRINCIPAL, PS/IS 184 NEWPORT:  My favorite phrase is "don't let the zip code fool you", because a lot of people do that. I am a product of Brownsville. My zip code growing up was 11212, and I'm sure if we Google one, one, two, one, two, all of the negatives will be exposed. I want our students to feel good regardless of their zip code. PS/IS 184 is a haven for learning. Attendance might be a challenge for a lot of our students because a violent crime may have been committed in the -- in the neighborhood, may have been committed in their complex, and there's some level of fear. Hence, that's why we try to create the safest environment internally. SUBTITLE: In order to improve attendance, Principal Linder created arts programs to encourage students to come to school. LINDER:  When I came here, I was a big advocate of the arts. Whole classes would just go to this one art teacher and no other arts offerings were made available. We instituted the following year where students were provided with an option to select which elective they would go to. So, to date, and we have the only marching band in district 23, we have added dancers to go along with the marching band. Broadway Jr. is like the creme de la creme of 184.  This year, we're doing Willy Wonka. So, you can see the difference. Students want to be present in school because we're rehearsing for Broadway Jr. We're performing for the Christmas showcase, right? So, I have to be present. So, we recognized by doing all of those things, it supported us with improving our attendance. Since the 10 years I've been here, we've seen sort of a roller coaster, I'll be honest, right? But we knew that we had to add and provide more. As a community school, we have a community resource director who identifies the gaps, what's not here. WARNER:  We are pretty much the hub of the community. Yeah, so when our parents are in need, they can come. LINDER:  How many parents are taking their children for exams? We're going to have the eye exams right here on site. WANDA SPEEDE, COMMUNITY RESOURCE DIRECTOR:  Today, as you can see, we had our food distribution of fresh produce, because we go into the supermarkets in the area, we will notice that there's a dearth of fresh natural foods. So, our book distribution, these are books that we've accumulated over the years, we've used them as class sets. We actually distribute those for free to families. So, we're excited that we can do this for the community. LINDER:  I will be retiring after 30 years with the New York City Department of Education. I felt like I had left an indelible impact on the school community and all the other communities I have worked in. AUBREY NICHOLSON, FORMER STUDENT:  Ms. Linder is an amazing person, and I would say that the school definitely, you know, started to thrive, I mean, when Ms. Linder got into the principal's office, definitely. MILLS:  Ms. Linder is like my second mother. ALIYAH BASKERVILLE, STUEDENT:  And thank you to Ms. Linder that she made that she's the main one who made this school and who made us feel powerful and brave. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. All of you powerful and brave people, your 10 out of 10 story today is about two friends from France who went to the World Cup in Qatar. Why? Because they traveled roughly 4,300 miles by bike. We're talking 13 countries, flooded woodlands in Hungary, a scorching desert in Saudi Arabia, dozens of flat tires. Their goal was to see their beloved team France, the defending World Cup champs. They told us, we're the kind of people that have big ideas and we don't want to have any regrets. Let's meet them. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MEHDI BALAMISSA, TEAM FRANCE FAN:  This crazy idea of going to Qatar from Paris by bicycle to attend the World Cup. GABRIEL MARTIN, TEAM FRANCE FAN:  It was under 7,000 kilometers, three months, 13 countries. We went from Paris to Istanbul. Istanbul, we went south was Jerusalem. Third of our adventure, weather in Saudi Arabia. BALAMISSA:  And we actually went through all kinds of landscapes, from Europe to the mountains of Turkey, and in the desert in the Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia. First stages in the desert were especially very hard because it's a very -- like it's such a hostile environment. And compared to what we experienced in Europe for example, there is just nothing around here. MARTIN:  We had a lot of surprises, but I think the most important but how hospitality is a world, a universal world. You know, in each country, we are received by people, giving us some food, even giving us some water, sometimes welcoming us at home. Arriving in Doha was incredible. There were so many people welcoming us especially from the French community based in Doha. We had the French national team here. They made the surprise to work on us, to take picture with us, and to offer the French national jersey with all the players signatures. BALAMSSIA:  So, we will fly back to Paris, but this doesn't mean bike trips are over the lifestyle that we actually loved, and I'm sure that we will want to go back on other adventures. We were actually very happy to document our trip and share with our followers on social media. And so, we also realized that this was a way of telling people that, look, you can take your bike and live adventures. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, lovely people. We made it. There ain't no mentum like momentum. So, let's finish this week strong and power right along into the weekend. First, though, a shout out to Lakeview Junior and Senior High School in Campti, Louisiana. Remember, you are more powerful than you know. I'm Coy. This is CNN, and it's been a blessing to spend this week with you. END221205

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. It's your boy Coy here, starting with some Monday motivation for you and me.  I challenge you to say the alphabet backwards -- Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T, S, R, Q, P, O, N, M, L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, G, A. Like that. And I want you to challenge me to work a unique word of your choice into tomorrow's show. Follow me @CoyWire on Insta, Snapchat and TikTok and put your challenge words in a comment, and I'll choose one fun one to work in tomorrow's show. All right. It's time for the best 10 minutes in news for you. CNN starts right now. We're going to start with the news out of Hawaii. On Sunday, huge amounts of lava continue to flow from the Mauna Loa volcano, the world's largest active volcano, which has been erupting for over a week now. It turns out the lava is creeping closer to a key highway that connects the east and west sides of the big islands of Hawaii. As of Saturday morning, the lava was just two and a half miles from the DKI highway. It had been moving around feet per hour over the last hours.  For now, the highway remains open and it's even attracted sightseers who have flocked the area to see the historic lava show. The volcano is erupting for the first time in almost four decades. The flow of lava is unpredictable. Its direction is expected to change hour to hour and day to day, making it difficult to estimate when or even if the lava flow will impact the highway.  In the meantime, Hawaiian officials say they have a plan to shut the highway down if the lava gets close enough to become dangerous. Now, while it may seem scary and potentially destructive, some people see it as beautiful. After all, the islands were formed as a result of volcanic eruptions. So without lava flow, there would be no Hawaii at all. CNN's David Culver is on the scene with the latest.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The nighttime glow of Mauna Loa's oozing lava -- well, you just have to pull over and properly admire it.  It's basically the middle the night and you guys are out here, why?  PIILANI ZYCH, OAHU, HAWAII RESIDENT:  Well, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to be able to experience this. And we decided to come early in the morning so we didn't have to sit in traffic.  CULVER:  Having hopped from Oahu to here, the big island, this family, three generations, came to respectfully honor the Hawaiian eruptions.  ZYCH:  It's all beautiful to us. So, we pay huge reverence to this. It's very culturally significant for us as well. So, it's a big deal.  CULVER:  A site made even more luring with the side of sunrise, which brought the crowds to old saddle road. Officials turning this stretch into a one-way street, allowing passersby the chance to stop and let the views seep in.  And that keeps drivers from pulling over and stopping on this, what is one of the main highways connecting one part of the island to the other. USGS and state officials warned, the lava flow, while slowed in recent days, is inching closer to cutting off this highway. It is within three miles now.  The other worry, not here on the ground but up in the air. What looks like plumes of smoke, experts say those are acid gases. Officials monitoring the levels, warning it could become tax toxic for residents and visitors of the big island.  Mauna Loa is the second of the big islands five volcanoes currently erupting. Kilauea is still rumbling after destroying more than 600 homes here in 2018.  But many Hawaiians see the potential path of destruction as simultaneous creation, surfacing from this, the world's largest active volcano.  And with the eruption continuing at its current pacing, officials feel like they should be able to give folks up to two days notice should the lava make its way onto that major thoroughfare cutting off that highway. But they also warn when it comes to the flow of lava, there is no forecasting. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Who conducted the first spacewalk, which took place in 1965? Alan Shepard, Yuri Gagarin, Ed White, or Alexei Leonov? While Ed White was the first American to space walk, the first to ever do it was Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  On Saturday, the International Space Station got powered up. NASA astronauts Josh Casada and Frank Rubio got suited up and floated outside the station to install a solar array or panel on the outside of the space lab. Their mission lasted seven hours. There were two solar arrays installed back in June of 2021, but now, the plan is to add a total of six more to hopefully boost the space station's power generation by more than 30 percent. The original solar arrays were only designed to last 15 years, but they've been supplying power for more than 20 years. They still work but they're definitely showing some signs of wear and tear after that long-term exposure to the environment.  When it comes to office views though, this one might be the best one in the world or the best out of this world. (MUSIC) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, a fresh look at a game of golf on the moon. Astronaut Alan Shepard will forever be remembered for becoming the first American in space in 1961. Putt in 1971, as commander of the Apollo 14 moon mission, he left viewers and even folks back at mission control stunned when he pulled out a club and ball to take a celestial swing on a fairway 230 miles away.  His moon game is now being seen in a whole new light after a NASA specialist dedicated over 10,000 hours to restoring flight film of the Apollo missions. Now here's teeing up for us right now. Roll it. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUBTITLE:  Over 50 years ago, Alan B. Shepard Jr. played a game of golf that was "out of this world".  Almost 240,000 miles away from Earth, Shepard hit two golf balls on the surface of the moon. Despite being so far away, he found a way to connect with the people back home. BRIAN ODOM, CHIEF HISTORIAN AT NASA:  I think it resonates with people because it's just a very human activity, a very, you know, a cultural thing that's taking place on the moon. So I think that's why it really resonates with folks. You can talk seismometers and all of this stuff all day long really of what they're doing on the moon, but you talk hitting a golf ball in the moon and people like, oh, yeah, right. Shepard obviously was the first American in space and he'd been grounded for a long time. So, you know, he thought he may never get to go back into space. So when he finally gets this, you know, his health works out and he gets this opportunity to go back, you can kind of see him thinking what's something fun and cool I can do to put my own stamp on this program. And, you know, sneaking things onto the capsule and hitting a golf ball, that seems to be pretty well in line with the Shepard we know. SUBTITLE:  Former property developer Andy Saunders found a new calling in enhancing poor quality NASA archive footage.  It was the lack of high-quality pictures of Neil Armstrong on the moon that started him on this path.  ANDY SAUNDERS, NASA DIGITAL RESTORATION EXPERT:  I wanted to see Neil Armstrong in the moon, he first person on another world, this monumental moment in history. Since childhood, I was obsessed with anything that could fly really from boomerangs and paper airplanes. Rockets were the ultimate, and it was also that added fascination with the moon. At one stage, I was kind of a semi-professional photographer, probably is about as serious as I got. And it's kind of uniting those two things, those two interests that led me to take on this, this particular project. SUBTITLE:  Like Armstrong, there was limited coverage of Shepard's feat, and it was Saunders' job to change that.  SAUNDERS:  They had TV footage of him swinging the club, live TV footage that was being back very, very, very low quality. But you couldn't see them and the ball disappeared off screen.  In the low res images, everything just looks like small rocks. But in a higher resolution scan, I could zoom right in, enhance it and find something which looked very much like a ball. SUBTITLE:  In February 2021, Saunders found the second golf ball and was able to accurately measure the distance traveled: 40 yards.  SAUNDERS:  When he said, oh, it's gone miles and miles and miles, I think he knew deep down that they didn't quite go that far. So 40 hours, that's terrible, but you know, they have these visors, they built your spacesuit. They could barely even see their feet. So visibility wasn't very good because of the restrictive suit, he had to hit it one-handed.  So to even make contact I think was pretty, pretty impressive. SUBTITLE:  Why do Shepard's actions resonate so much? ODOM:  It's the human side of this. It's, you know, that's the thing we can't forget. When it comes to a human activity, something that's done just for the joy of being alive, that's something that people can appreciate. SAUNDERS:  You know, a lot of people know that someone play golf on the moon but not a lot of those people would know that it was on Apollo 14. That there was even wasn't Apollo 14. So, you know, those human moments resonate forever, and that -- and that's one of the few. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  That's all we have time for, for now. We hope that that story helped to capture your i-moon-gination in this marvelous Monday.  Our shout-out today goes to a school of innovation. The Franklin School of Innovation in Asheville, North Carolina.  Our goal is to shout out all of your schools lunar than later. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire and this is CNN 10. END221206

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. As the ancient philosopher Confucius once said, we have two lives and the second begins when we realize we only have one. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. With just 86,400 seconds in this day, let's get going and let's make the most of them. We're going to begin with the latest out of Indonesia where Mount Semeru, a very active volcano, erupted on Sunday, blanketing roads and homes in volcanic ash and promoting evacuations of nearly 2,000 residents in the East Java province. The volcano spewed thick columns of ash, nearly 5,000 feet into the sky and as far as 7.4 miles away. Villages and nearby towns blanketed with falling ash, blocking out the sun but thankfully no casualties have been reported. On Monday, improved weather conditions allowed rescuers to resume evacuation efforts in a search for possible victims. The area of eruption is the most densely populated island in Indonesia, nearly 2,000 people escaped to emergency shelters at several schools. Indonesia's officials warned residents to stay at least miles away from the volcano's eruption center. But many felt they had to return to their homes Monday to protect their property. The eruption in East Java on Sunday following a series of earthquakes on the west of the island, including one last month that killed more than 300 people, and many residents are still traumatized after more than 50 people were killed, and thousands more displaced when the same volcano erupted just last year. We'll continue to follow this story as well as the Mauna Loa volcano eruption in Hawaii. Let's hear more now from my friend, CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice-over):  Ash fills the skies in Indonesia, forming a thick caustic cloud over Mount Semeru on the island of Java. Video from the country's ministry of environment and forestry captured the explosive eruption on Saturday a burst of ash shooting 15 kilometers into the sky, a sign for people living in the volcano's shadow it's time to go. This man, escaping on a motorbike, the ash caking on his face. He says he doesn't know where he's going just somewhere out of the volcano's reach. Authorities say nearly 2,000 people have been evacuated from the slopes of the volcano which is located about kilometers southeast of Jakarta. The roads in the area are packed with vehicles rushing to outrun the volcanic ash that is still raining down. Emergency workers are directing people out of the danger zone, handing out masks and urging them to go to shelters. INDAH AMPERAWATI MASDAR, LUMAJANG DISTRICT DEPUTY CHIEF (through translator):  We have readied some nearby schools and village halls. We will prepare them until the observatory post declares it's safe. CHINCHAR:  The damage has already been done to some areas. Rooftops are singed and the ground is covered with smoldering soot. Authorities are telling people to stay at least eight kilometers away from the eruption center, but there are fears the hot ash could drift further. So far, many people are heeding the warnings, a lesson learned last year when more than people were killed in a previous eruption and thousands were forced from their homes. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which U.S. state nickname was inspired by the sticky sap of its pine trees? California, Montana, North Carolina, or Alaska? With vast pine tree forests, North Carolina is nicknamed the Tar Heel State. Power outages in North Carolina are causing so much concern that the FBI is investigating. Officials believe intentional attacks on substations are causing power outages in Moore County near Fayetteville. But at this time, they haven't named any suspects or even motives. Forty thousand customers were in the dark as of Sunday. The investigation turned into a criminal investigation when utility crews found signs of potential vandalism to equipment at several different sites, including two substations that were damaged by gunfire. We're talking millions of dollars in estimated damage. In order to protect residents, property, businesses and public services, the authorities announced a mandatory curfew from 9:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m. in the county. The curfew which started Sunday will continue nightly until there's an emergency declaration. This outage is impacting the community in all sorts of ways as you can imagine. All schools in the county were closed on Monday. There was no church on Sunday. Traffic lights are out. Many businesses are closed, with a few stores using generators to open their doors. Authorities opened a shelter which is running on a generator. According to local officials, the damage is significant and rerouting power just isn't an option. As of Monday, an FBI manhunt was underway. But whoever is responsible remains a mystery to the community. We'll keep you updated in the coming days right here on CNN 10. Next up, CNN business producer Jon Sarlin is introducing us to BlocPower, one of a handful of companies looking to make clean energy affordable for everyone. The Brooklyn, New York-based business wants to help companies prioritize helping the climate, while also lowering utility bills and saving money. The company also targets dense and low-income neighborhoods where significant cost savings can help the most. They've reached nearly 1,200 buildings in New York so far. Let's learn more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JON SARLIN, CNN BUSINESS PRODUCER:  From eating locally to buying an electric car, being eco-friendly can be expensive especially when it comes to making our homes greener. In 2020, residential and commercial buildings accounted for 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. But the cost of buying and installing green technology can cost tens of thousands of dollars. DONNEL BAIRD, CEO, BLOCPOWER:  Greening buildings can be really difficult, complicated and hard and a little scary and expensive. SARLIN:  But what if it wasn't expensive, and you could make your building green without paying any upfront costs. A company called BlocPower is one of a handful of companies trying to make that possible. BAIRD:  Our job is, okay, how do we make clean energy affordable for everyone? A lot of building owners and property managers might not care about climate change as their top priority, but they definitely care about reducing their costs because that's money that can go in their pocket. SARLIN:  BlocPower leases and installs equipment like solar panels and heat pumps, energy efficient devices that both heat and cool buildings and use about 50 percent less energy than furnaces or baseboard heaters, all of which means lower bills. According to BlocPower, installing a heat pump can lower utility bills between 20 and 70 percent a year, the company is able to make back its money over time by taking a portion of the building's savings. LINCOLN ECCLES, BUILDING OWNER:  It looks very clean and very sleek. I like I like how you guys did this. This system it's quiet, it's clean. I've literally had tenants come up to me and tell me that they see a real savings in their actual electricity use. NOAH, BROOKLYN RESIDENT:  Right, so that we had a radiator system, the radiator was either just hot, extremely hot or non-existent, so my bill has significantly been a lot cheaper. SARLIN:  Greening buildings has become more competitive with companies like Sealed also offering retrofits with no upfront costs. BlocPower says it prioritizes greening dense, low and moderate-income neighborhoods where buildings are often outdated, and cost savings are needed most. BAIRD:  I grew up in a low-income apartment building. All the buildings were overheated. The tenants had opened up all the windows and we're burning energy that was like floating out of the window. And so, I was like man, there's a massive problem here. SARLIN:  Since 2004, Brooklyn-based BlocPower has upgraded over 1,200 buildings in New York, and they're partnering with cities around the country to help them hit carbon goals. With investment from the Bezos Earth Fund, they're currently building proprietary software that they say will help them identify greening opportunities for millions of buildings. BAIRD:  The most rewarding part of working at BlocPower for me is I'll be able to look my kids in the eye and say I did everything I could to prevent the climate disaster. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10, an Illinois 8th grade hooper hitting legendary status with an epic buzzer beater. Milton Pope down just one with just seconds to go and the opponent misses a free throw, but Cooper Thorson snags the rebound dribbles around, he heaves it, and you better believe it. Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Cooper hitting the nearly full court shot but dropping it like it's hot. The whole moment was caught on camera, creating the perfect viral moment. CNN highlight reel. Take that chef Steph Curry, this is Cooper's kitchen. And that kid is eaten. And now on to our favorite part of the day, I want to give a special shout out to Foxboro High School in Foxboro, Massachusetts. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one, going out and make someone smile today. Remember that kindness is not what you do, but who you are.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. I'm Coy Wire, ready to make this a wonderful Wednesday with you. But before, I start I must say I am bumfuzzled by the amount of creativity and passion with which you accepted my challenge to pick a word for me to work into yesterday's show. It was supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, if you didn't notice. And don't worry, I'll challenge you to another one next week. We start today with the latest on the economy. If you've watched the news in the last few months, it's likely you've seen concerns from consumers and experts about the economy or headlines featuring layoffs especially in the tech industry. However, this month, the economy showed a continued demand for workers, and new jobs were added to the market. This is despite the Federal Reserve's push to curb inflation which was predicted to impact the economy and the job market. Let's break it down by the numbers. Employers added 263,000 jobs this month. That's only a slight drop from 284,000 added in October and the unemployment rate was unchanged this month at 3.7 percent. We'll bring you now to Christine Romans, CNN chief business correspondent and anchor of "EARLY START" who will tell us more about the state of the economy and consumer concerns. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Behind all those headlines of tech layoffs, sour consumer confidence, inflation anxiety, it's an economy showing resilience. Surprising strength in the economy in the third quarter, 2.9 percent annual growth from July through September, a sharp bounce back from a contraction in the first half of the year -- you know, it's a pace that would have been considered very strong before the pandemic.  The job market remains strong, too. Another 263,000 jobs added in November. It's the fewest in months but it's more than economist forecast.  This year, a stunning 4.2 million jobs added. Stripping out the pandemic, it's the most jobs added in years. And inflation, while still too hot, is showing signs of cooling.  The fed's favorite inflation gauge, the PCE price index showing signs of peaking, and gas prices are falling. They're below where they were when Russia invaded Ukraine.  Call it the yes-but economy. Yes, consumers feel like the economy is bad, but they keep spending. After all, it was a record Thanksgiving shopping season. So, why the foul mood and the sometimes conflicting headlines?  Well, COVID broke the economy and putting it back together has been hard to measure. Remember tens of millions of jobs were lost overnight, schools closed, factories shuttered, more than a million lives lost. More than two years later, we're still struggling to gauge the strength and durability of the recovery. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia, which of these animals is part of the Canidae family? Grizzly bear, golden retriever, gopher, or goldfish? Often referred to as canines, dogs, including golden retrievers, are part of the Canidae family. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Up next, we're introducing you to a very special organization called Canine Companions. They're the oldest and largest organization in the U.S. that provides service dogs. They provide service dogs for children and adults with a wide range of needs, including both physical and emotional support. These pups are uplifting and they're pretty doggone cute, too. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELINDA SOWERS, VP, CANINE TRAINING AND CLIENT SERVICES, CANINE COMPANIES:  We're in Orlando, Florida. We are at the southeast region campus of Canine Companions. We are the largest and oldest organization that provides service dogs for children, adults and veterans with disabilities. And we work really hard to transform lives. At Canine Companions, we offer several different types of dogs. One of the types of dogs that we offer is a service dog. The service dog works with someone to mitigate their disability. They can pick up items, open and close doors, drawers, refrigerators. The dogs can know over 40 commands. We want the dogs to love the work they do. SUBTITLE:  Canine Companions places dogs who can help with more disabilities, PTSD, emotional support and physical therapy. SOWERS:  Since 1975, we've placed over dogs. We currently have over 2,600 graduates that are out there working with service dogs to our organization, and over 1,400 puppy raisers who are raising puppies for us. SUBTITLE: Dogs are trained from puppyhood for over two years before being placed with people in need. The service animals are matched with their new recipients during a process called "team training".  SOWERS:  Team training is just a magical time.  It's for so many of them, the moment that they have been waiting for.  IZZY & ALANA SHERMAN, CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA:  So, we applied I want to say a year and a half ago. We just knew that this was the right thing because as he's been in and out of hospitals because of brain cancer, and all the facilities we've been in have therapy dogs and they just bring so much joy to the kids. The ability to give her not only a companion but a skilled companion that can help with some of the challenges that we face daily. SUBTITLE:  Canine Companions breeds Labrador and golden retrievers for their temperament and work ethic.  SOWERS:  We provide all of our dogs free of charge just thanks to amazing donations.  SHERMAN:  I mean our medical bills are quite high. So it's really a gift to our family. SOWERS:  We want to make sure that anybody who needs a service dog or a facility dog is able to get one. SUBTITLE:  To increase their supply of service dogs, Canine Companions partners with Duke University's "Puppy Kindergarten," a program designed to identify strong service dog candidates.  Aurora attended Duke Puppy Kindergarten before finishing her training at Canine Companions.  SOWERS:  And then at the end of that team training class, they'll have a graduation ceremony where they will graduate and go home. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Today is Canine Companions national graduation day. Instead of a diploma, our graduates today will be handed a leash. SHERMAN:  You know, it isn't the unknown. And the unknown brings questions. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Congratulations. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, we're going to meet a voice that might be familiar to you if you've ever been on TikTok. I was pretty blown away actually when I found out this voice was actually a person and not a computer.  Let's meet Kat Callaghan, the real life woman behind TikTok's text to speech feature and one of the most popular influencers online. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAT CALLAGHAN, VOICE OVER ARTIST:  Songs that made artists famous.  If you have an air fryer, you need to try this. Would you sit in this seat? My name is Kat. I work with TikTok on TTS and other projects. You're probably sick of my voice. I am sick of my voice. SUBTITLE:  Kat Callaghan, the voice behind TikTok's "Jessie" text-to-speech feature, recently revealed herself on her TikTok account. CALLAGHAN:  I understand people are a little bit freaked out that have never heard my voice before in association with a human being. I've had interviews for the last several weeks with people going, okay, I can't -- I can't look at you, because I think you should say, I can't look at you when you're talking. And you don't hear it in my regular voice all the time but once I hit that upper inflection, you know you can hear it. SUBTITLE:  Callaghan, a radio host in Canada, is still getting used to the fact that her voice is TikTok famous.  CALLAGHAN:  People are recognizing me as the voice of TikTok, and also as a radio person. I was walking down the street and a car stopped and said, "Voice of Kat", which is my which is my TikTok handle is "Voice of Kat". And I'm just like, oh, yes, hello. SUBTITLE:  However, reactions from the revelation haven't been entirely positive, with users mocking Jessie's text-to-speech feature limitations.  CALLAGHAN:  The way I say law. Definitely not a perfect technology. I'd like to have fun with the fact though that Jesse mispronounces words.  Why do you say emoji like emoji? It's one of the funniest things to be honest with you is people commenting, say this, say that, or why do you pronounce it this way? So I plan to just continue to have a little bit of fun with that. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. We are so grateful to spend part of our day with you. To get your shout out, remember to subscribe to our YouTube Channel CNN 10, and leave a comment with your school, name, city, state and mascot, and the pronunciation if necessary. Chandler Academy in Charleston, West Virginia, thank you for showing the love. We're showing it right back at you. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire and this is CNN 10. END221208

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. It's Thursday. So happy Friday eve. It's your boy Coy, Mr. Clean, but I keep it cleaner. Let's keep crushing it this week each day aiming to be a little better than the day before. This is CNN and it's time to fuel our minds. We start with an update. China is scrapping some of its most controversial COVID rules, moving away from their strict zero COVID policy which have caused people mental and emotional stress and strain. Earlier this month, protesters took to the streets in a rare display of defiance against the country's ruling communist party. The people are reeling from the effects of the government placing millions of people under lockdown and limiting access to loved ones, food and even medicine. All this on top of the economic strain it's caused. China's zero COVID policy has kept the nation's infection rate lower than countries like the United States by isolating every case of COVID and shutting down the surrounding areas. But easing restrictions now marks a significant step in the government's plans to reopen the country. This week, the Chinese government announced 10 new guidelines that loosened restrictions, most notably allowing people with COVID to quarantine at home instead of being taken to an isolation facility, a practice which previously frightened its citizens. The government is also dropping mandates that required proof of a negative COVID test to enter public places. These are some of the significant steps which should offer relief to China's residents after nearly three years of disruption to their daily lives and economic futures. But there's still concern. Twenty-five million people in China have not received a coronavirus vaccine. If there's an influx of new cases, it could overwhelm the hospital system, leading to a potentially tragic situation for citizens. Our Selina Wang has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  This is the kind of line Beijingers stand in, outside in the cold to get their COVID tests. A 48-  hour test is required to get into most places. But there aren't many places to go. Much of Beijing is still closed down. This is one of the most popular tourist places in the city. But the restaurants are largely closed, and the malls are pretty empty. So, this McDonald's is still open but for takeaway only. But even to get takeaway, you've got to prove that you're clear of COVID. Here's how I do it. I open up the health app on my smartphone, I scan the QR code. So, it says, I've got a green code, and I've got a recent COVID test, so I'm good to go. This code dictates all of our daily lives in China. Green means good to go. Red means I may have to isolate at home or go to a mass quarantine facility. This allows China to track the movements of virtually all 1.4 billion people in the name of contact tracing. I've got to scan my code to get into a taxi, a public park, a mall, or a coffee shop. Even a public bathroom. (voice-over):  I ran into a group of delivery people on the street. They've got to do COVID tests every single day to do their jobs. This woman tells me the pandemic has been hard on her. I ask her why. She says it's because she's scared of the virus. Getting COVID in China is unlike anywhere else in the world. You and your close contacts all get sent to a quarantine center. This is a convention center in Beijing that's been turned into a massive quarantine facility with thousands of beds. But some of these facilities in the country, they are in very run-down and unsanitary condition. And then your whole building or community could go into lockdown. I spoke to a man who's been in and out of quarantine six times already just this year. He tells me his whole building of more than 200 families went to a quarantine facility last month, because they were considered close contacts. He says he's not scared to get COVID because omicron is less severe and his whole family has been vaccinated. I approached a few people just released from this mass quarantine center here. I ask if they had tested positive for COVID. Yes, the man nods and says they have recovered. "How many days did you spend in there?" I asked. "Seven days," he said. Unprecedented protests recently erupted across China. They are chanting that they don't want COVID tests, they want freedom. Authorities swiftly cracked down on the protesters. But they are finally softening their stance on zero COVID. Some cities are lifting lockdowns, changing COVID testing requirements. Under some conditions, people can now quarantine at home if they have COVID, which is a huge deal. But this country has already built up a whole infrastructure around zero COVID, spending all of its resources on quarantine facilities and COVID testing. So it's going to be a long and slow exit from zero COVID. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In the animal kingdom, oysters are classified under what phylum? Mollusca, arthropoda, chordata or porifera? Oysters are soft-bodied invertebrates belonging to the phylum mollusca. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Did you know that scientists estimate that oysters have been around for 15 million years and they're far more valuable than the beautiful pearls that they can produce. The reefs that take shape as they grow together create a shelter where hundreds of other species can flourish. They're also crucial for ocean health, filtering the water around them. One oyster can filter gallons of water per day. Let's hear now from conservationists who are hoping to be successful in restoring Hong Kong's famous oyster reefs in CNN's Call to Earth. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Tucked away in the northwest corner of Hong Kong with the high-tech Chinese mega city of Shenzhen in sight is a rich habitat that is home to mangroves, soft, muddy shores and oyster reefs that date back centuries. For over 700 years local farmers cultivated oysters here in the mud flats of Pak Nai and recent decades, traditional oyster farming has declined due in part to coastal reclamation and over harvesting. But conservationists like Marine Thomas have discovered that reintroducing oysters to the abandoned reefs can boost biodiversity and strengthen these shores. MARINE THOMAS, SENIOR CONSERVATION PROGRAM MANAGER, THE NATURE CONSERVANCY:  Usually, people will associate oysters with food but less known is that oysters and other shellfish create habitats. They create reef habitats. In fact, just like coral reefs, they will bunch together and create these hard structures that you can actually walk on. STOUT:  In a survey of the city's coastlines, researchers from the Nature Conservancy at the University of Hong Kong discovered existing reefs like these old farms could potentially act as a source of oyster larvae. They also found that a single Hong Kong oyster can filter up to 30 liters or 8 gallons of water an hour, one of the highest filtration rates recorded for the species. Another finding, the reefs host six times more species and bare mud flats as the piles of shells provide shelter for worms and small crabs, attracting a variety of animals including birds like this little egret. And yet another benefit is mitigating the effects of climate change, so how does the humble oyster do that? THOMAS:  So the humble oyster will also help us fight climate change if it's in a reef structure so if it's in a hard reef structure that is creating a barrier, think of it as a natural sea wall then it's going to be creating friction on the sea bottom that will attenuate wave action and therefore also flooding at the back of it. STOUT:  Since 2020, Thomas and a team of volunteers have been at work restoring this abandoned oyster farm. They dry old shells in the sun before returning them to the water to form a base for oyster larva to attach to. They hope to introduce millions of oysters to help revitalize the area over the next few years. ASHLEY HEMRAJ, MARINE BIOLOGIST, THE SWIRE INSTITUTE OF MARINE SCIENCE, THE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG:  One of the biggest things that always amazes me and makes me happy is seeing all the number of crabs here, especially here as you walk, the crab walks away. It's -- if you fix on it, it's quite amazing to see this. It is really, really beautiful. STOUT:  As new oysters grow, they clean the water, provide shelter and food for wildlife and join forces with the mangroves as a coastal buffer. A spectacular sunset descends on Pak Nai as these small briny creatures work to build an ever more vibrant ecosystem. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, if you're a jogger and you're claustrophobic, this race is not for you. Hundreds of jolly old joggers in a Santa run in Michendorf, Germany, jingling all the way, dressed in red from head to mistletoe, look at all those Santas go. Talk about spreading Christmas cheer, this is the 14th annual race. One Santa said that even if you finish last, it's being there that counts. They ran in near freezing temperatures, maybe getting fit to deliver those gifts, Santa even without his sleigh still slays. It's slay-NN 10, the most wonderful time of the year and the most wonderful part of this show: you. Special shout out to all the teachers today. Keep up lifting, informing and inspiring students. Going up and dap your teacher up give them a handshake or a high five. Let them know that you appreciate them. Also getting a shout out, Holdrege Middle School in Holdrege, Nebraska. Keep shining. I'm Coy Wire. I'm headed to Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love. So I'll see you from there tomorrow. END221209

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people, and welcome to the city of Brotherly Love, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, my home state. I'm standing in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and you may recognize those steps, the iconic rocky steps. We're here for one of the greatest rivalries in all of sports. Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. Eastern, it's the 123rd edition of the Army-Navy football game and it's so much more than a game. Dating back to 1890, the traditions, pageantry, passion and respect make the Army-Navy game the greatest rivalry in American sports. The game is so big, 10 sitting U.S. presidents have attended, from Theodore Roosevelt in 1901, to Donald Trump two years ago. It is humbling to watch this rivalry. It's said that this is a game where everyone playing is willing to die for everyone watching. That's powerful stuff. This is America's game. If only all of us could have the perspective of these individuals representing the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York. They stand their ground against the opposing side, but afterwards, they walk across the field and embrace each other as brothers and sisters because they never forget that in the end, they're all on the same team. But don't get me wrong they play hard for bragging rights that'll last a lifetime. Navy leads the series 62-53-7 all time and to paraphrase the 34th president of the United States Dwight Eisenhower, the Army and Navy are the best of friends 364-1/2 days out of the year. But on this one Saturday afternoon, they are the worst of enemies. The rivalry is also loaded with traditions, like when Army West Point's marathon team runs the ball about 150 miles through the night and through the elements, from West Point to Philly. There's also a flyover before the game during the national anthem, and there isn't a dry eye in the stadium. Later on in the show, I'll tell you about some of the fun pranks associated with the rivalry. But first let's take a look at some of the headlines of today. WNBA star Brittney Griner was released from a Russian prison yesterday. In February, she was arrested on drug smuggling charges when traveling through the Moscow airport. In August, she was sentenced to nine years in a Russian prison. Griner's release on Thursday was part of a prisoner swap between Russia and the United States. A convicted Russian arms dealer Victor Bout was released from a U.S. prison. He was previously sentenced to 25 years on charges of conspiring to kill Americans and providing weapons to terrorist organizations. The swap did not include another American that the state department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whalen. Here's what President Biden had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We never forgot about Brittney. We've not forgotten about Paul Whelan who's been unjustly detained in Russia for years. This was not a choice of which American to bring home. We brought home Trevor Reed when we had a chance early this year. Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul's case differently than Brittney's. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul's release, we are not giving up. We will never give up. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next up, scientists say they have now confirmed why we get more colds in the wintertime, and they say it's a major breakthrough. According to a recent study, it turns out that the cold air damages the immune response occurring in our noses. When we're exposed to cold air the temperature in our nose can drop by as much as 9 degrees Fahrenheit and that kills nearly percent of the billions of virus and bacteria fighting cells in our nostrils. It's enough to essentially knock out all of the immune advantages that our nose has to offer. More research is needed to understand how this research could be used to prevent illness in the future. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these prehistoric animals was a marine reptile? Allosaurus, Plesiosaur, Diplodocus or ankylosaurus? While the others on this list were all land dinosaurs, the plesiosaur was a marine reptile and an intact skeleton of one was just discovered in Australia. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUBTITLE:  This 100-million-year-old intact plesiosaur skeleton was discovered in Queensland, Australia. Amateur paleontologists known as the "Rock Chicks" uncovered the remains of the 19-foot-tall reptile in August. Researchers say the finding may provide vital clues about prehistoric life. DR. ESPEN KNUTSEN, SENIOR CURATOR OF PALEONTOLOGY, QUEENSLAND MUSEUM:  So, usually, what we find is that when we're digging these things out of the ground is that we'll find bits of the body, no head, and very, very rarely, we'll find just ahead, but unfortunately with no body attached. So the fact that this guy had both allows us to close that gap where they have this overlap between the body and the head that will unravel a lot of the species diversity, of how many species of these long neck pieces also swimming around here in this outback ocean 100 million years ago. SUBTITLE:  Plesiosaurs are not classified as dinosaurs as they did not have gills and had to surface to breathe. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Okay. Now to those pranks I was telling you about. As I mentioned at the top of the show, there's so much tradition associated with the Army-  Navy game but some of it is all in good fun. Exhibit A, this year, Navy flew over the Army's campus and dropped a bunch of ping pong balls that said, go Navy, beat Army. But every year, the Navy has to protect their beloved mascots, their goats, because the Army tries to steal them. A while back I got to interview the goats and their protectors. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Preparations for the Army-Navy game can be intense. You have the game plan, the playbooks and the practices. But perhaps one of the most important facets of pre-game preparations here in Annapolis has nothing to do with the players, but rather mascots, goats, and more specifically protecting the goats. Can you tell us where you keep the goats? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I can't tell you that.. WIRE:  We won't tell anyone. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, afraid I can't do that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We don't want Army to come and steal it, like we know they're not capable of doing it, but just for a precaution measures. WIRE:  So, we're talking maybe confidential, secret or the location of the goats. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Above top secret. So, we're -- this is a whole separate classification. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They're kept at a pretty secure location though. They have a guard dog. WIRE:  So, there is a guard dog? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There is, and he is massive and scary. WIRE:  You think if I ask a goat, maybe they would tell me where they're kept. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You could definitely try but they've been briefed heavily, and let's just say they probably won't give you anything either. WIRE:  Can you tell us where your hideout is? Are you aware of the Army's hype video that they released? It alludes to an elaborate plot to steal the goats this year. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Confirm the role of Billy the Goat is the head of Navy spirit group. WIRE:  Does it make you nervous? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It does not. I've seen our security measures and especially the dog once again is I don't think anyone could get past him. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We feel the goods are pretty secure, and not many people know their location, and even if they did, they'd have a hard time stealing them. UNIDENTIFIED MALES:  Fear the goats, beat the Army. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. For today's 10 out of 10, the Oxford Dictionary just announced their word of the year. Drum roll, please. It's -- wait, what? The word is goblin mode, technically two words. It's a slang term that became popular during the pandemic, and it means someone that is unapologetically self-indulgent and loves being lazy. This way of life rejects all social expectations. Yeah. I know, we're not talking about anyone in this group, right? Yeah, sure. All right. We are going to switch from goblin mode to beast mode. All right, being that we're at one of the most popular tourist destinations in all of Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, you know I had to take you on a run with me up the iconic Rocky steps from the 1976 film "Rocky". Thousands of people flock to these steps every year to mimic one of the most famous movie scenes in the world. Rocky Balboa finishing a morning run at the top of these steps, a symbol for all the underdogs out there. Now, we're going to give a special shout out to New Hope Middle School in Columbus, Mississippi. Rise up. And for all of you underdogs out there, keep working everyone every single day. Keep believing in yourself, so that you can make your dreams come true, too. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. Yo, Adrian! END221212

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone.  I'm Coy Wire, and welcome to a special edition of CNN 10. You likely don't know this but the program you're watching right now started all the way back in 1989 when CNN launched a news program designed for the classroom. And today, we're going to look back at one of the most influential stories from that year. It involves protests in China's Tiananmen square that changed the course of history. Tiananmen Square is located in the center of the Chinese Capital of Beijing. In 1989, after several weeks of demonstrations by students and other citizens calling for a more Democratic government, Chinese troops entered the square on June 4th and fired on civilians. It's estimated that several hundred to thousands were killed, and as many as 10,000 people were arrested. Accounts of the massacre are still censored in China today. We now have a special report of CNN's coverage from on the ground that year and as you'll see after the Chinese government pulled the plug on the broadcast, CNN had to report by telephone and use video that was snuck out of the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NARRATOR:  Fifteen years ago, China was still almost totally isolated from the rest of the world. Today, the encouragement of private enterprise, free markets, foreign investment, and the introduction of western products and ideas has made this country the pioneer in the communist world search for reform. But now, China's reform program has run into trouble. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Inflation officially has been at the 20 percent level in recent months. Corruption has grown a great deal. NARRATOR:  These dislocations caused by an economy that is only half reformed, neither communist nor capitalist, have generated widespread public discontent. SUBTITLE:  CNN was in Beijing as public discontent led to demonstrations and one of the darkest moments in China's history. NARRATOR:  In the dead of night, 2,000 students marched through the streets of Beijing, calling for democracy human rights and the resignation of the Chinese government. Their destination: Tiananmen Square in the city center. SUBTITLE:  Tiananmen Square is the government's ceremonial center and one of the largest plazas in the world. NARRATOR:  It was here that the students placed a huge banner honoring the memory of Hu Yaobang, who died on Saturday in political disgrace purged by communist party hardliners two and a half years ago for his liberal views. To the students however, Hu represented hope for reform and change, hopes that to many Chinese have been dashed by recent government efforts to scale back economic and political liberalization. There has never been a challenge to the leadership of communist China like this one. In cities all across the country, crowds taking to the streets to demand democracy and freedom. In commemorating Hu's death by demanding the implementation of the progressive policies he advocated, the students have put the government on the defensive, most notably by using tactics such as the peaceful sit-in that the authorities here have never seen. PROTESTERS:  Long live freedom! Long live freedom! Punish corrupt officials! Punish corrupt officials! Freedom of the speech! Freedom of the speech! SUBTITLE:  Chinese leadership was divided on how to respond and attempted to limit the public's awareness of the demonstrations. However, some journalists were sympathetic to the demonstrators. NARRATOR:  The students got a big boost when several official Chinese newspapers defied government orders and published accurate accounts of the events of the past week. SUBTITLE:  As public support grew; student activists encouraged the general population to join the call for reform. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  If you're going to have a student movement, you must seek support from the workers and peasants. Only if they understand can we succeed. NARRATOR:  Again and again, the badly outnumbered police were overwhelmed and pushed aside. SUBTITLE:  On May 4th, nineteen days after the protests began, tens of thousands of demonstrators converged on Tiananmen Square. May 4th was the anniversary of the 1919 student movement that led to the communist revolution. REPORTER:  This was the demonstrator's destination, Tiananmen Square, the heart of Beijing, the seat of the government. NARRATOR:  The scene at Tiananmen showed the depth of public discontent here now, over inflation, corruption and the lack of political freedom. SUBTITLE:  One month into the demonstrations, The students sang the Internationale, the international communist anthem. NARRATOR:  On the eve of Mikhail Gorbachev's visit, China's rebellious students up the stakes in their confrontation with the government, adopting a new set of tactics to force a faster pace of reform. Two hundred students started a hunger strike, marching through Beijing to downtown Tiananmen Square, vowing to stay without food until the authorities agreed to recognize their illegal students' federation. SUBTITLE:  China's leaders were scheduled to meet in Beijing with Mikhail Gorbachev to mend years of strife between the communist republics. NARRATOR:  With Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union's pioneer of political reform due here on Monday, no one in the Chinese leadership wants him to have a reception like this. SUBTITLE:  The number of hunger strikers quickly grew. REPORTER:  This is now the third day in which about a thousand students have been carrying out a hunger strike to press their demands for democracy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Gorbachev's reforms have been extremely successful. So we hope his visit will help accelerate political reform in China. NARRATOR:  A growing number of those in the square are not students but journalists professional people and especially workers impatient for change. For China's leaders, there could not be a more embarrassing or frightening set of circumstances. BERNARD SHAW, CNN ANCHOR:  Now some thoughts, I came to cover a summit. I walked into a revolution, a massively peaceful statement by the people but still a revolution. SUBTITLE:  By May 19, an estimated 1.2 million demonstrators had gathered in Tiananmen Square. NARRATOR:  Huge crowds again serves through the center of Beijing, people from all walks of life, workers, taxi drivers, shopkeepers, even some peasants from the countryside while lending their support to the hunger striker's demand for freedom and democracy. At the same time, over a hundred thousand people demonstrated in Shanghai where 300 students had begun their own hunger strike. SUBTITLE:  Government leaders visited the students to ask them to end their hunger strike. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You have every right to criticize us. I'm also not here to ask for your forgiveness this time. NARRATOR:  Communist Party Chief Zhao and Premier Li visiting Tiananmen Square to appeal for an end to the student hunger strike. Late in the evening, Premier Li appeared on nationwide television to announce that the situation was out of control and that the army was being called in to restore orders. LI PENG, PREMIER OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (through translator):  The situation in Beijing is getting worse and it is going to bring out a nationwide riot if we don't really do anything to crack to stop this situation. NARRATOR:  Communist Party Chief Zhao, a liberal who had sympathized with the students, being enforced to resign. REPORTER:  There is word authorities decided he had to go because he refused to agree to use force against the students. LI:  For a month, the government has taken very calm and tolerant attitude towards the students' demonstration. We did this because we love our students. SUBTITLE:  Premier Li Peng claimed that the students were under the influence of a few troublemakers, and those on hunger strike were 'hostages". The People's Liberation Army was ordered in to clear the square. REPORTER:  Masters of demonstrators marched out of Beijing and rode in cars to the west. Before dawn, more than one hundred thousand were on the outskirts of the city, taking the confrontation to the troops, not waiting for the army to reach town. SHAW:  The People's Liberation Army blocked by the people. The troops cannot move to clear Tiananmen Square. ANNOUNCER:  This is CNN's Prime News. And in Beijing, Bernard Shaw. SHAW:  Let's go quickly to Jeanne Moos in Tiananmen Square -- Jeanne. JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Bernie, we don't have any real hard information down here. The same announcement keeps coming over the PA system. It's an official announcement signed by the premier of China, according to the announcer. And it talks about martial law being imposed here in Tiananmen Square. It was a night of tension, a break of celebration in the morning of uncertainty. SHAW:  Jeanne, Jeanne? MOOS:  Yes, Bernie? SHAW:  I'm being told that the government officials are coming into the CNN control room now. This man with a piece of paper in his hand. I'm certain that is not a party invitation. Okay, let me quickly tell you what this official is saying: if you do not obey the orders, you will not be allowed to come home. This official on the right side of your right side of your screen saying to CNN, if you do not obey the -- NARRATOR:  The Chinese government ordered all foreign media to stop broadcasting. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You have him call us properly and explain to us what is happening here. If you cannot give us an explanation. UNIDENTIIFIED MALE:  Moment, please? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Fine. SHAW:  We're told that President George Herbert Walker Bush is watching what's happening. President Bush is saying, quote, word of the news blackout is very disturbing. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our government led me to tell you now stop your transmission. SHAW:  These characters being written on this legal pad in effect are saying that this government is telling CNN to end its transmission. (END VIDEOTAPE) END221213

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. We have a rendezvous with the news. I'm back from Philly, feeling refreshed, ready to crush this week with you. We start with a rocket ship returned. After a 25-1/2-day mission around the moon, NASA's historic Artemis I mission made a successful splashdown on Sunday. The uncrewed test flight was meant to pave the way for future missions, which could take astronauts back to the moon, The Orion spacecraft pulled off a record-breaking mission including two lunar flybys, one with an 80-miles of the lunar surface, more than 1.4 million miles traveled in all before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean, just west of Baja, California. After landing, the capsule spent six hours in the ocean with NASA collecting additional data and running some tests before the rescue team moved it, a fleet of recovery vehicles were waiting nearby. The landing was key to making sure that the Orion spacecraft is ready to fly real astronauts next time and then eventually to Mars. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  And here we go, the lead-up to the Artemis I launch might have been a bumpy ride after a series of delays due to technical glitches and bad weather, but NASA says once its mega rocket got off the ground it's being smooth sailing. MIKE SARAFIN, ARTEMIS MISSION MANAGER:  We got to witness the world's most powerful rocket take the Earth by its edges and shake the wicked out of it, and it was quite a sight. BLACK:  After three and a half weeks in space filled with engine burns, lunar flybys and stunning views of the earth and the moon, NASA's Orion spacecraft is home. But before it's splashed down a critical test, in one of the most nail-biting times of the re-entry process, the Orion capsule will separate from its service module then complete a skip maneuver off the edge of the Earth's atmosphere, which will bring it closer to its landing site and cut down on the G-forces that future astronauts will have to endure. After that, all eyes are on the heat shield as Orion blazes back to earth at temperatures twice as hot as molten lava. NASA says the heat shield has been tested more than a thousand times and making sure it can take the heat is one of the primary goals of this mission. From the outset, the uncrewed Artemis I mission has been a dry run to make sure the spacecraft is safe enough for astronauts to fly on board. BILL NELSON, NASA ADMINISTRATOR:  We are stressing it and testing it in ways that we will not do to a rocket that has a human crew on it. BLACK:  If Artemis I is a success, it will be followed by Artemis II, which like the first mission will fly around the moon, but this time with a crew. That will be followed by Artemis III, which intends to return astronauts to the moon's surface, including the first woman and person of color. Later missions will aim even further with the goal of sending astronauts to Mars. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE (voice-over):  Ten-second trivia: The equator runs directly through which of these countries? Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria or Ethiopia? All of these countries are close to the equator but only Kenya is crossed by it. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  We have introduced you to several of our CNN heroes this year but on Sunday night, Anderson Cooper and Kelly Ripa announced the CNN Hero of the Year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  The CNN Hero of the Year is -- KELLY RIPPA AND COOPER:  Nelly Cheboi! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Congratulations to Nelly Cheboi. She creates computer labs for school children in her native Kenya. In 2019, Nelly quit her software engineering job to create her non-profit TechLit Africa. Since then, she's provided thousands of students with upcycled computers in a way to connect with the world. Voters online selected Nelly from a list of CNN's Top 10 Heroes. As CNN Hero of the Year, she will receive one hundred thousand dollars to expand her work. Her story is incredible. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NELLY CHEBOI, CNN 2022 HERO OF THE YEAR:  I never forget what it was like growing poor. I never forget what it was like my stomach churning because of hunger at night. I would have to go and scavenge for food at trash bits. We grew up in a tin roof house. It was full of potholes. I used to look at the different light bouncing from the holes from the roof, and then just imagine what we look like to sustainably fix poverty. I was a very hardworking student even though I wasn't in school often, and even though I was the most hardworking person I knew, I still did not know what a computer was. I am from Mogotio which is a small village in rural Kenya. And there isn't much of an economic activity here. I got a full-ride four-year scholarship in America at Augustana College in 2012. I got a job as a janitor cleaning bathrooms. I discovered computer science in my junior year of college just out of accident. I needed to take an introduction to java for my math major and I just fell in love with it. I just knew this was what I wanted to do and also bring it to my community. Every three years, companies are upgrading their IT. Most of these computers are ending up in landfills. Well, we have kids here, myself included back in the day, who don't even know what a computer is. And so, what we're doing is that we're working with institutions, colleges, companies, even individuals and then we bring it to the schools. We refurbish them. We install our own custom operating system that is geared towards teaching our kids self-efficacy, troubleshooting and Internet skills. All of you are going to be graphic designers today. The kids that we are working with are actually from four years old all the way to 12. And there's also vectors, it doesn't matter how much you zoom, it's still perfect, it's still a line. We have people coming in and just inspiring the kids. They can go from doing a remote class with NASA to music production, video production, coding, personal branding and so on. Right now, we're working with 4,000 kids. My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, their families and themselves will not need aid because they can make money online. That money will support their families. Their money will support themselves. I can't even describe just how dehumanizing poverty is. Just getting crushed over and over again. My mom was working really hard and I was still going to bed hungry. I was still living in a house that was flooding. But the world is your oyster when you are educated. The thing that was really fascinating me growing up, not seeing change, not seeing hope, not even seeing progress. I feel like with this kid, I can see a path like, I can see a way where they can make a living online. And that is really like why we're doing this work. My life is bigger than myself. If I have the power to change anything, I have to do it. I have to give it my all. I can keep doing it. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, Mother Nature is up to snow good. Areas in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California were pummeled with up to three to four feet of snow over the weekend. Snow my goodness. Combine that with strong winds and even hail, and look out, don't get in that ski lift. It's about that time of year I guess whenever all that snow melts, it'll be thaw-some. If high fives, hugs and handshakes were snowflakes, I'd be sending you all a blizzard. Thank you for all the love. We're sending it right back to you. Shout out to Patrick Henry Middle School in Woodhaven, Michigan. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. END221214

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. It's your boy Coy. Wonderful Wednesday to you. Last week, so many of you accepted my challenge. You are giving me a unique word of your choice to work into the show. We had a lot of fun responses so we're doing it again. It's your word Wednesday. Follow me @CoyWire on Insta, Snapchat and TikTok, and put your challenge words in the comment section of my most recent post, and we're going to choose one fun word to work into Friday's show. All right. It's time for the best minutes in news because it's with you right here on CNN 10. We start with news on a winter storm. This week all across the country, winter storm warnings, winter storm watches and winter weather advisories have been issued by the National Weather Service. The strong start to the snow season is in place for an area that extends as far east as the upper Midwest, northern Great Lakes and interior parts of the Northeast. In fact, 25 million people from Texas to Mississippi are under threat of severe storms. In the south, two tornado watches are in effect. One in the Dallas area, the other in southern Oklahoma and about 15 million people largely in the north central U.S. are under winter weather warnings or advisories including fears of intense snow, ice, hail and freezing rain. These storms are leaving a trail of damage especially in parts of Oklahoma and Texas where buildings were wiped off of their foundation and homes and businesses were seriously damaged. In addition, roads were closed in traffic was delayed. This remains a developing story we're going to keep you updated right here on CNN throughout the rest of this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: in science, what is occurring when two atoms slam together to form a heavier atom? Combustion, fusion, fission or oxidation? Answer here is fusion. When two or more atoms are joined together to make a larger atom. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  This week, scientists with the U.S. Department of energy have reached a breakthrough in nuclear fusion for the first time ever in a lab setting, researchers say they generated more energy from a fusion reaction than they use to start the process. We're talking two or more atoms being fused together to form a larger one, and if scientists figure this out, fine tune it and harness this capability, we could potentially power our entire house from essentially a glass of water forever. This could help end dependence on fossil fuels. Talk about a game changer in the future of clean energy. We'll go now to CNN national correspondent Rene Marsh for more of the science behind the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RENE MARSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, scientists at a Department of Energy lab in California have figured out how to successfully produce a nuclear fusion reaction with a net energy gain. That means they've succeeded in taking two hydrogen atoms and using 192 powerful lasers to force those atoms to fuse together, unleashing the same kind of energy that powers the sun and stars. Until now, that has been incredibly difficult to replicate here on earth. The key is though that they've been able to release more energy from the reaction than they use in the fusion process itself and that's critically important. For anything to be a viable source it needs to have a higher energy output than the energy input used to generate the power. So this is a huge moment mostly because the discovery could eventually unlock an unlimited cheap, clean power source for the world. Now, this discovery has also proved this is a viable energy source and no longer a hypothetical scenario. But as major as this is in the quest to pivot away from dirty energy sources like fossil fuels, we're still a far away off from powering our homes by way of nuclear fusion it's estimated it could take two even three decades before this energy source is widely used. Rene Marsh, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  When hurricane Ian pummeled Florida in late September, it brought over $50 billion in damage to the state and tragically took lives of 148 people. It also had an unexpected consequence. It destroyed Florida's bee colonies. The colonies are used to pollinate the nation's agriculture. CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir spoke to Florida beekeepers about what this could mean. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Now you going to get a handful of bees. BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT:  Really? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes. WEIR:  OK. (voice-over):  I'm not usually in the habit of accepting a handful of stinging insects. But Keith Councell has a 40-year professional relationship with honeybees. And you never really wear a veil or gloves or anything? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't really need to. WEIR (voice over):  And these days, they need all the love they can get. Hurricane Ian arrived at the worst possible time for this business. Just as beekeepers from around the country were set up to catch the autumn bloom of the Brazilian peppertree. The storm drowned and crushed hundreds of thousands of hives, killing countless millions of bees. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's gone. You have to come back, right, nothing left. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You could actually see a water line where it came up to here. WEIR:  And because Ian blew away so much vegetation, those that survived are starving. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Some of these bees have going to get three shots of feed and that's a gallon. So you're talking about 36 pounds of feed already and you can still go back after they suck the feed down and it looks like they never were fed at all. WEIR:  They're just starving. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They're just starving. Yes, it's nonstop. So it's just an added cost and you're just trying to do the best you have to make that tough decision of really is it worth the money. The financial costs to try to save it or do you just have to walk away and take your medicine. WEIR:  This is all bee food. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This will be used for liquid bee food. Yeah. WEIR:  At Mann Lake Bee and Ag Supply, they're mixing sugar water as fast as they can. And while some bee farmers filed for federal relief, the Greater Good Charity is giving away a quarter ton of pollen substitute. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have donated meals to food pantries for humans. We've donated animal supplies to animal shelters. And now, we're donating this bee pollen substitute to these farmers here. WEIR:  Can't forget the bottom of the food chain, right? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, can't forget what helps get all the other food to the table as well. WEIR:  But even if their bees recover, the whole business depends on the health of the almond crop in California now shrinking under mega drought. If the drought takes out the almond crop in California that -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The whole beekeeping industry is going to be in trouble and there's no feral bees. There's no -- wild bees can't survive on their own. WEIR:  He explains the pesticides development and invasive pests have made it impossible for bees to survive without deliberate human care. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And if all the beekeepers released all of their bees, every beekeeper in the country, if they just released all their bees into the wild, we estimated about two to three years; the poor bees would just collapse. These are the most important farmer. They're the most forgotten as well. And that's why we just need the entire public to really continue to get involved in bees and a little -- two bee hives makes a big impact. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They went totally underwater, somehow made it. WEIR:  In the meantime, all Keith can do is pick up the pieces and focus on the survivors. Like the hive, he found drowned inside a water meter box near Fort Myers Beach. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's a different feeling and you have bees walking all over you. WEIR:  It really is. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And nobody's getting stung. Yes, they're doing their thing. WEIR:  Maybe they can sense we're rooting for him, you know? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, and that's part of the thing you have to treat him with respect. When you get down to it, the bees are the pillars to all agriculture. They're the pillars to our whole civilization. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: And up next, an adorable story for our 10 out of 10. The Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control has strict rules about what types of animals people can have in their yards but they were hit with cuteness overload when they got a letter from a six-year-old Madeline asking if they'd let her keep a unicorn in their backyard if she's able to catch one someday. Well, knowing that unicorns are notoriously difficult to find in Los Angeles the department went ahead and gave her a stuffed unicorn in the meantime along with a permanent unicorn license. Good luck, Madeline. All right special shout out to Valley View Junior High in Jonesboro, Arkansas. Go Blazers. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. Can you believe that we're fewer than three weeks until 2022 is over? Well, I can't wait to celebrate the New Year with you. I'm Coy Wire and this is CNN 10. END221215

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. It is Thursday. So, happy Friday eve. I'm your host Coy Wire. Grateful to be right here with you on CNN 10.  We're here to break down some top storylines in an upbeat and easy to understand manner. This is our penultimate show before we take a long holiday break just today and tomorrow. So let's make the most of them. First up, government officials in the United States are preparing for a surge of migrants along the country's southern border with Mexico. A December deadline to terminate a public health authority known as Title 42 is coming up. The policy was created at the start of the coronavirus pandemic and allowed officials to quickly turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border due to concerns over the spread of the virus.  Well, an end to that restriction is expected to lead to an increase in border crossings and members within both Democrat and Republican parties are raising concerns over whether officials should consider a new policy. President Biden's administration is already asking Congress for more than $3 billion in assistance as it prepares for the end of the Title 42 policy. And the influx of migrants has already started. U.S. border officials have been contending with thousands of migrants crossing the border daily and expect those numbers to increase in the coming days and weeks. Let's break this story down by the numbers.  Over the weekend, U.S. border authorities apprehended more than 16,000 people. In a single section of the border in El Paso, Texas, more than 2,400 migrants crossed into the United States each day. Many officials speculate that the end of the title policy could overwhelm an already strained system.  We'll hear now from CNN national correspondent Ed Lavendera in El Paso, Texas, with the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  As the sun fades away over El Paso, a large group of migrants stand on the borders edge waiting to be processed by border patrol agents. While a few others tiptoe across a short path through the Rio Grande.  These migrants are part of a major surge of border crossings seen in El Paso in recent days, and it is happening as the projected and of a Trump era restriction draws closer, ending the policy to swiftly expel migrants at the U.S. land borders.  U.S. border authorities interacted with more than 2 million migrants in the last year, up from the previous year. But in recent days, an average of almost 2,500 migrants a day have been moving across this border, between Mexico and the U.S. through El Paso.  CLAUDIA RODRIGUEZ, EL PASO CITY COUNCIL MEMBER:  Title 42 is only going to make that situation worse, they're going to have more apprehension, so we are going to see a lot more releases into the community, and we're not prepared for it.  LAVANDERA:  Just three weeks ago, according to Customs and Border Protection, the seven-day rolling average was fewer than 1,700. Thousands of migrants are now coming from Central and South America as well as Cuba, according to U.S. immigration officials.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm helping them get food, whatever they need. This is not even about politics. It's about humanity. These people are here and they are cold.  LAVANDERA:  Some have been camping out across the border in Ciudad Juarez, in Mexico, raising concerns they will cross in mass if Trump era border restrictions end about a week.  Still, others have already been boarded into buses to be processed or turned around under the provisions of Title 42.  JAKE SULLIVAN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  We are taking steps to be able to manage the expiration of Title 42 and to put in place a process that will be orderly and humane. We believe that in doing so we can protect our national security concerns.  LAVANDERA:  Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas arrived in El Paso today, and says he is meeting with Customs and Border Protection, local officials, and organizations.  For now, the immediate problem is housing, and managing a large influx of migrants.  RUBEN GARCIA, DIRECTOR, ANNUNCIATION HOUSE:  If the court cases get resolved, and the courts allow Title 42 to be lifted, we are going to see thousands of refugees for whom there isn't shelter.  LAVANDERA:  The director of a local El Paso shelter says border patrol recently dropped a busload of migrants at his doorstep. And he is worried he will soon have to turn people away.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're going to have to say no, not because we want to, but simply because we don't have space. The reality is, there's just too many people.  (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What is the most populated country in the world? Russia, China, United States or India? With an estimated 1.4 billion people, China edges out India as the most populated country in the world.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  As we've discussed, China is reopening its doors after three years of its zero COVID policy, the last country on the planet to do so. While the policy did keep spread of the virus low, it stressed the daily lives of citizens inside the country, with mandatory tests and quarantines. But now that many of the restrictions in China have been removed, by many accounts, the streets feel more empty than when's restrictions were there. Why? Because fear of the virus remains, in large part because coronavirus is spreading quickly in China. More now from CNN international correspondent Selina Wang who's on the scene in Beijing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  China is starting to unravel its zero COVID policy. But instead of crowds out celebrating, this is how reopening is going in China -- close shops, empty streets, people avoiding each other because for the first time since the start of the pandemic, COVID is spreading like wildfire in Beijing. People now either have COVID or they're scared to get it. So I just spoke to the shop worker in the store and he told me that he's the only employee without COVID which is why he can still come to work and he says, I am the only customer who has come into this store all day. The only crowds I'm seeing in Beijing outside of hospitals like this and pharmacies.  So he says his fever's gone down but he still has a cold, hoping to buy medicine but he's worried they don't have any stock because there's these long lines forming outside of pharmacies across the country people are trying to stock up but stuff is selling out.  You know, for years, China has been demonizing COVID, playing up the risks of long COVID and now suddenly state media is publishing headlines every day saying COVID is not a big deal. It's whiplash for a lot of people because just weeks before, if you got COVID, your whole community would have gone into hard lockdown. This is such a major and sudden change.  So China is finally opening up. How do you feel about it?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I feel is pretty great. I wish they could have opened up earlier. WANG:  Has business been very slow or difficult? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, you can see, there -- there are not that many customers. A lot of people just got the virus. WANG:  Are you scared about getting COVID? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm worried about my parents and my grandparents a little bit. WANG:  People are relieved though that you no longer have to go to a quarantined facility if you get COVID. Getting sent to one of those rundown facilities was such a big source of anxiety before. And these health QR codes that have been used for years to track and dictate where we can go -- well, the government is now saying that you don't need them to enter most public places. So I don't need to scan my code. It feels surreal though that I can literally just walk in. So she said I can only do online delivery. So you can't even sit inside or order inside in Shake Shack.  So outside the Starbucks, they have a sign saying you need to show a 40- hour COVID test, even though the national rules don't require it, in Beijing, you still need a recent PCR test in order to enter restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues. There are way less places now to get COVID tests in the city, and the lines are short because most people are just staying at home. But just a week before, at this exact same location, this was packed with people waiting in line. So behind me is a graveyard of COVID testing booths. It's like almost overnight in Beijing, they removed all of these testing locations and here's the remnants. After years of harsh lockdowns, the government is finally letting people manage their own health. But people don't feel ready and experts say the country isn't either. The country hasn't vaccinated enough of the elderly population and has it improved the health care capacity enough. So this reopening it's going to continue to be messy and uneven. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, a family from Gretna, Virginia, is an enlightened bunch who really know how to conduct themselves at Christmas time. Mike Clay says he used more than 30,000 lights to decorate his house and it lights up the entire street. Inspired by the movie "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation", he says he decorates in memory of his grandfather. His light bill jumps up by a hundred dollars though during the month but he says it's total really worth it. If loving Christmas is wrong, Mr. Clay don't want to be light because he loves Christmas a lots. Shout out to Clark Middle School in Anchorage, Alaska.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. You made it to Friday, and you already know Friday's rock. Now, this is a last show of 2022, and one thing making it extra special is that you helped write it. See if you can find your word that you sent me via social media sprinkled somewhere within.  I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. Let's finish this week's strong. We start with news on the economy, specifically the labor force. Employers need workers and that's good news. There's nearly two job openings for every job seeker. The shortage of workers in the United States has many employers ready to fight to retain talent. This is especially good for previously untapped labor populations where traditionally it was difficult to get a job.  And it also seems particularly good news for job-seeking women. The last jobs report revealed that 62 percent of the job gains last month went to women, narrowing the gap in labor force participation rate between men and women.  New data this week shows that middle-aged men ages 35 to 44 have been slow to rejoin labor force recently the participation rate for men ages to 30 to 44 is lower than it was before the pandemic. Economists say there are many reasons the male labor force participation rate is down, including changing needs and interests in the post-pandemic world.  We'll hear more now from CNN reporter Vanessa Yurkevich who has reported extensively on the labor market. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID SHNITZLER, AT-HOME DAD:  Good morning, Winston. Let's start the day.  YURKEVICH (voice over):  It's a typical day in the Shnitzler household. Seventeen month old Winston is up and parents David and Allison (ph) are getting ready for work. Winston is fed, there's some play, and then the morning good-byes.  ALLISON SHNITZLER, FAMILY PHYSICIAN:  Bye-bye. D. SHNITZLER:  Say bye-bye. YURKEVICH:  They're off to work. A. SHNITZLER:  Bye-bye. Have a good day. YURKEVICH:  Allison, a family physician, and David, an insurance underwriter, now an at-home dad.  D. SCHNITZLER:  Caring for Winston, tending to the house, playing with him, all of that comes first.  YURKEVICH:  Last year the Schnitzler's made a significant life change.  D. SCHNITZLER:  We made that decision to have me stay home.  YURKEVICH:  David quit his job to take care of Winston full time so Allison could continue her career.  D. SCHNITZLER:  We're happy with the roles that we're in. It's phenomenal.  YURKEVICH:  And in recent months, more men ages 30 to 44 have been dropping out of the workforce according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The labor force participation rate for men in that age group is lower than it was pre-pandemic.  RICHARD V. REEVES, SENOR FELLOW, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION:  I don't think it's a secret that many of us rethought our whole work life balance, what were we doing, who's raising the kids, how do we want our family to work? That's a question that a lot of families have been asking themselves. YURKEVICH:  And more women in recent months ages 30 to 44 are participating in the labor force and at a higher rate than pre- pandemic according to Labor Department data. And they're moving into more male dominated industries.  REEVES:  The fears of a she-cession turned out largely to be unfounded. Women are returning to the labor market. It's becoming increasingly common to see women, for example, having project management roles or generally management positions within construction.  YURKEVICH:  Women like Ava Sedaghat.  AVA SEDAGHAT, PROJECT ENGINEER:  I knew I wanted to work in construction management.  YURKEVICH:  Sedaghat joined the construction industry two years ago as a project engineer. Today, women make up just 14 percent of the construction industry, but it's the highest on record.  SEDAGHAT:  I think it was definitely intimidating. My only knowledge of the construction industry was that it was pretty heavy and male dominated. But the more that I started working in the industry and the more people I came into contact with, I think I realized pretty quickly on that there's a place for everyone in construction.  (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia:  The term "metaverse" was coined by: A science fiction writer, the founder of Facebook, a programmer at Google, or a college professor? In 1992, the term metaverse was coined by sci-fi writer Neal Stephenson.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ever since its inception, the metaverse has had many people flummoxed, even flabbergasted. Is it simply like a video game or could it evolve actually into a common way of life?  In the metaverse, you can virtually be transported from your couch to a classroom, from a living room to a work luncheon. You could walk alongside a hippopotamus on safari or wear a spinny hat and get rambunctious with friends at a concert by Bieber, Drake in the weekend, and you wouldn't even have to leave your room. While this technology is catching up with fantasy, it's still being built and is constantly evolving. CNN reporter Anna Stewart has more from Dubai. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN CORESPONDENT:  Remember this movie? The concept of a virtual universe is rooted in science fiction and for years, it's been just that fiction. But now, technology is beginning to catch up, bringing the idea of the metaverse to reality.  It's home to concerts, expensive digital real estate and hugely popular games. But what exactly is the metaverse? What does it do, and why should you care? Let's break it down. NEAL STEPHENSON, AUTHOR, SNOW CRASH:  It means a virtual environment. STEWART:  This is Neal Stephenson. He came up with a term metaverse back in 1992. For his book "Snow Crash". Back to you Neal. STEPHENSON:  Where large numbers of people can get together and interact with each other, not as they are but through avatars, which are kind of the three-dimensional representations. STEWART:  For so long, our experiences with the Internet have been 2D, it's been something we look at. But the metaverse gives users the sense of being transported into the Internet like this.  Oh hi. ANDREW BOSWORTH, CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER, META:  Hello. STEWART:  Meet Andrew Bosworth, also known as Boz. He works at Meta, formerly named Facebook. Great.  Do we shake hands? How does this work? BOSWORTH:  We can do a high five.  STEWART:  This is Horizon Workrooms, the company's foothold in the metaverse. It's just one of the many ways into the metaverse that are currently available. In these virtual worlds, you can play games, do business and dance with strangers that turn into friends, except that this friend could be on the other side of the world. BOSWORTH:  Is it as good as being together? No, and it probably never will be, but it's the next best thing. STEWART:  This all sounds exciting, until you realize that the technology for building this new iteration of the Internet is -- well, still being built. For now, it's this place where you can be whoever you want and immerse your virtual self into this alternative world that pushes past physical barriers, to collaborate and interact with other virtual avatars, objects and environments.  As promising as it all may sound, we still have a long way to go before we're living like this.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello from Buffalo, everyone. It's your boy Coy and we have missed you. We hope the start of your New Year has been full of love and positive energy. I know we're feeling it now that we are back. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start with a remarkable story that has transpired here in Buffalo, New York, this past week. Bills' player Damar Hamlin was tragically injured, suffering cardiac arrest in the first quarter of their game last Monday. And in an unprecedented move, Bills players and head coach Sean McDermott refused to play on. In the past, games have always played on, but these NFL players prioritize their mental health over the outcome of the game.  Hamlin spent the following days in critical condition but eventually showed enough progress to surprise the team with a video called days before their final regular season game. The team said that's all they needed. The game was magical. Bills head coach Sean McDermott said it was going to be a celebration of life, the power of three, Damar's jersey number was everywhere. Then, powerful moment, the medical workers and training staff who pounced in with poise and precision to save Damar Hamlin's life walk to midfield getting an ovation as big as any we've ever heard. Then, game time. And on the opening play, the Bills first since the tragic injury goosebumps, when Nyheim Hines took the kickoff back for a touchdown. It had been three years and three months since the Bills had done that before. Bills star quarterback Josh Allen said it was spiritual, bone chilling, and Damar Hamlin watching from the hospital tweeted: God behind all this no coincidence. Buffalo would go on to win 35-23. Here's star offensive lineman Dion Dawkins on what he's learned through all of this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DION DAWKINS, BUFFALO BILLS:  No second, no breath, no event, no situation is promised. It could be a drastic this or this at any moment. And I have truly learned to be a better father, to be a better partner, to be a better person. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Remember lovely people, we can find strength through our struggles, find heroes through heartache. The world has come together to support Damar Hamlin. His GoFundMe charity to raise money to buy toys for kids originally set out to raise twenty five hundred dollars. It has skyrocketed to more than $8.5 million so far. All right. Next up, we're bringing you to Washington, D.C. with an update on what's happening in the U.S. Congress. Every time a new political party gains the majority in the House of Representatives, a new speaker of the House is elected. The speaker is in charge of the House's legislative agenda, its committee assignments, and deciding on voting procedures.  Democrat Nancy Pelosi stepped down from her role as speaker of the House in November following the U.S. midterm elections where Republicans won back control of the House. This week, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy was elected speaker, but it wasn't easy. McCarthy made numerous concessions over the course of many days before he finally earned a majority and was elected on the 15th round of voting.  To secure the gavel, McCarthy and his allies overcame opposition from a group of conservative critics within the Republican Party. It was the longest contest in 164 years. Many Republicans fear this may make it harder to govern in the future while Democrats who voted unanimously for their candidate, the minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, were happy to see what many called chaos for the opposing party. More now from politics reporter Eva McKend who has more on the proceeding from the nation's capital. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER:  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy securing a victory at long last by picking off his detractors one by one, doing so through making some key concessions. Namely, it will require only one member to trigger a vote that could potentially lead to ousting the House speaker. Take a listen to what McCarthy had to say after the vote. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Don't judge us on how we start, watch how we finish. And I think by having the disruption now really built the trust with one another and learned how to work together. What we're going to have to find in our mindset is that we have to front load that we have to think about and work on the bills with a microcosm of the conference before we even start writing it and that's really what we learned here. MCKEND:  So you can hear McCarthy there really striking in optimistic tone Republicans have done so as well, arguing that this week really illustrated that this is what democracy looks like. That sometimes it is messy -- well, Democrats, they have a different view. They say that the chaotic episodes that played out on the House floor time and time again really illustrate that Republicans are not prepared to govern.  They will face another key test. This new Republican leadership on Monday when they have to vote on a House rules package. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Okay. Yesterday, President Joe Biden made his first trip in office to the U.S.-Mexico border where he visited El Paso, Texas. This follows a major immigration policy announcement by the president who visited the border Sunday for a first-hand view of the border enforcement operation. Biden has faced backlash in recent months from both Democrats in his own party and Republicans who believe he has not managed immigration issues well while in office. Democrats condemn recent immigration policies as human rights violations while Republicans say the president has not done enough to limit border crossing amid recent surge.  We'll hear now from Arlette Saenz, a CNN White House correspondent based in D.C. who has more on the details of the visit. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  El Paso, Texas, a city that has seen a surge in migrants in recent weeks. Officials here at the White House say the president wants to see get an assessment of the border security situation on the ground there, and he will meet and hear from officials with Customs and Border Protection. The president will also be joined on this trip by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.  And officials have also said he the president wants to learn more about the efforts to stem fentanyl flow into the country.  Now, this all comes as the president has faced pressure not just to visit the border but also address these issues regarding the border, as it has quickly become a political liability for President Biden. The Texas governor, a Republican, Greg Abbott, said that it's about time that President Biden paid that visit down to the U.S.-Mexico border.  But on the other hand, the president has also accused Republicans of engaging in demagoguery, saying that they need to come to the table to pass comprehensive immigration reform which this White House says is the only way to fully ease these issues relating to the border.

Answer is: the smallest and shallowest ocean on earth is the Arctic Ocean. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next up, a snowy owl normally found in the Arctic tundra shows up 3,000 miles away amid palm trees and beaches of sunny southern California. The extremely rare sighting has transfixed a California community, but as for how the owl arrived there, who-who could know? Maybe CNN reporter Jeanne Moos. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It's a head scratcher, all right, how did a snowy owl that normally lives in the Arctic tundra end up amid the palm trees of southern California? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I consider an honor to be able to see the bird. MOOS:  Bird lovers are flocking to Cypress, California, to get a peek. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That's so exciting. I see a bird that does not belong here. MOOS:  Yeah. Well, not everyone is excited. JARET DAVEY, WETLANDS AND WILDLIFE CARE CENTER:  There were all these crows that were just dive bombing it and trying to like scare it away and the owl was just unfazed. MOOS:  Not so unfazed, the birder who posted this video Nicholas Belardes admits, "I teared up". A marine biologist told "The New York Times" it's like seeing Santa Claus on a beach.  Wildlife experts are watching the owl like a hawk, even to the point of climbing up a ladder to retrieve a pellet regurgitated by the raptor. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh so a treasure right away. MOOS:  The birds expel the indigestible parts of their meals, so the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center decided to check on the owl's taste in California cuisine. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This looks like the skull. Yeah, look at that, the skull of some kind of rodent. MOOS:  We know what it ate but we don't know how it got here. Is it an escaped illegal pet? Or did it hitch a ride on a freighter from up north? Or maybe it just got disoriented and flew too far south? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It looks nice and fluffy. MOOS:  Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, still here in Buffalo, New York. Yesterday, I told you about the remarkable story of the Buffalo Bills who rallied in their final game of the regular season for their injured teammate Damar Hamlin who suffered cardiac arrest during their game last week. Well, I am happy to report that Damar has been released from the hospital in Cincinnati and is back in Buffalo. So some encouraging news to start our day. All right. We've got a big show for you but only 10 minutes to do it, so let's get to it. We start with the latest news from Brazil. Political unrest gripping the streets of Brazil this week. Supporters of the country's former president, Jair Bolsonaro, storming official buildings in the capitol to protest what they believe was a stolen election. The election was narrowly won by former Brazilian President Lula da Silva, who first served in the role from 2003 to 2011.  But Bolsonaro encouraged supporters to question the country's electronic voting system. Over one thousand people were arrested for protesting. Bolsonaro supporters have been camping out in tent cities ever since the election back in October.  The new president will face major challenges early on as divisions in the country feel profound. More now from CNN's Rafael Romo, a senior Latin American affairs editor of CNN worldwide.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR:  Brazil boiling over. Supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro stormed key buildings in the country's capital Sunday breaching security barriers and temporarily occupying the country's Congress, presidential palace and Supreme Court.  Masses of protesters flooded the country's seat of power, many dressed in the colors of Brazil's flag yellow and green, fueled by anger and distrust over Bolsonaro's defeat in a runoff election last October where he lost by less than two percentage points to current President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva.  Protesters threw objects and scaled the roofs of buildings, while clashing with police who responded with tear gas. At least one protester was seen sitting at the desk of Brazil's congress president.  CNN Brazil reports the floor of the Congress building was flooded after the sprinkler system activated when protesters attempted to set fire to the carpet. By evening, police began dispersing the rioters from buildings and arrested hundreds of people who were detained in buses before being taken to the police station. President Lula Da Silva who was inaugurated just a week ago described the events as barbaric and vowed to punish the people responsible. LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Those people that we call fascists. We call them everything that's abominable in politics. They invaded the government headquarters,. and they invaded the Congress like vandals, destroying everything in their path. ROMO:  President Lula da Silva also blamed his predecessor for the lack of security in the capital where Bolsonaro's supporters have been camped out for over a week. Bolsonaro who is currently in Florida denounced what he called the depredations and invasions of public buildings in a tweet, adding that peaceful and lawful demonstrations are part of democracy.  But critics say Bolsonaro may have stirred up the crowds by repeatedly saying without evidence that he questioned the integrity of the country's electronic voting system. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: After China, India, and the United States, which country has the highest population? Pakistan, Russia, Indonesia or Mexico? Home to over 275 million people, the fourth most populated country in the world is the archipelago of Indonesia. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next, we're traveling to the province of Bali, Indonesia, where Bali is facing a water crisis. Once clean water is dirty from tourism development, population growth and water mismanagement. While Bali sees a lot of rain, water shortages are already impacting Bali's culture and the people's quality of life, and experts warn the situation will worsen if water control practices aren't properly implemented. Let's go now to Bali to learn more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The Indonesian province Bali is known for its rich culture, breathtaking natural beauty and rain, lots of rain. But while tourism took a hit during the COVID-19 pandemic, a five-month rainy season doesn't stop millions from visiting the island in a typical year. And for those who live here, the seasonal deluge serves as a reminder of an ongoing water crisis. In fact, one innovative local school has made the stuff of life the centerpiece of its curriculum. LESLIE MEDEMA, HEAD OF CAMPUS, GREEN SCHOOL BALI:  We chose water as a theme for last year and this year because despite what everybody thinks, there's a water shortage in Bali. We have rains for months and months and months, and they fill the reservoirs but very, very quickly those reservoirs run dry. WEIR:  More tourists and residents take a dramatic toll on the island's natural water resources, but that's not the only concern. MEDEMA:  Just in the last 10 years, many, many villages have been noticing their once clean water has turned very, very dirty, and no longer usable. We've noticed a very serious water crisis arising in a place where that really shouldn't be the case. WEIR:  Tucked away in a forested patch miles inland from the southern beaches, the Green School Bali was built to create the next generation of problem solvers. MEDEMA:  Currently on campus, there are student-led projects that have been activated. WEIR:  Built from bamboo and other sustainable material, the impressive open-air facilities were designed to inspire imagination and creativity, each structure a base for what the school's founders call a living curriculum. MEDEMA:  The point is to be part of reimagining education, to be something that inspires action-based learning now all across the globe.  WEIR:  We are cultivating an optimistic, thoughtful and positive approach to climate and climate action. We want them to feel hopeful. We want them to feel like they have the skills, they have the ability to engage proactively in the world. After a group of students became fascinated with biofuels, the school created a network of bio buses, each running on used cooking oil refined by science. MEDEMA:  You're looking at a really wide-ranging learning experience from enterprise to marketing to management because it became its own company and the largest biofuel transportation company in Indonesia. WEIR:  Dipta is an 11th grader driven to find solutions by the desperate need close to home. DIPTA, STUDENT, GREEN SCHOOL BALI:  It starts off personally, right? The problem comes off from my hometown Kintamani, we didn't have enough water and then after that realizing that also a lot of other people don't have access to clean and drinkable water. He launched Liquify, a non-profit with a mission to provide sustainable filtration systems, help residents build recharge wells that replenish aquifers, and water catchment systems to collect rainfall for other uses.  DIPTA:  The innovation hub that we have at green school gives me the tools to create what I need to create, what I want to create, and to help me help other people as well. The Green School Bali opened in 2008 and now includes locations in New Zealand, South Africa and Mexico. MEDEMA:  Our mission is a community of learners making our world sustainable. And so when you put community back at the center of a school, you end up being more accountable for the actions that you take and I think that's a good thing. It's the full spectrum of local to global action-based environmental learning. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEIR:  And for today's "10 out of 10", a family in Plainville, Connecticut, could barely believe what they discovered in their backyard. Their dog started acting all nervous one day and they soon learned a black bear was hibernating under their deck.  After contacting their local environmental agency for advice, the family decided to do the bare minimum. They're going to grin and bear it and have a backyard slumber party all winter, just let the big fellas news I guess and hibernate. And around mid-March though, old sleepy is going to wake up and the first thing bears typically do is they search for food so look out doggy. All right. Dad joke alert: what do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear. All right. Time for our special shout out today. Madison County High School in Madison, Florida. Go Cowboys!

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. I wonderful Wednesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we've got a rendezvous with the news. Still here in Buffalo, New York, outside of Buffalo General Hospital, and yet another positive update on Bills player Damar Hamlin who suffered cardiac arrest during a game last week. Hospital officials have told us doctors are optimistic that Damar could be well enough to go home in the coming days and his parents are here in Buffalo reunited alongside their son. So wonderful, wonderful news. Next up today, a prominent research group in Washington recently conducted a war game simulation of a possible conflict. It's one that's preoccupied military and political leaders in Asia and across the world. The scenario would be an invasion by China against Taiwan. Taiwan is a democratically ruled island of 24 million people that the Chinese Communist Party believes belongs to their sovereign territory. The Center for Strategic and International Studies ran the program as software that it claims is one of the most extensive war game simulations ever conducted on a possible conflict over Taiwan. The company believes the project was necessary because previous government and private company war simulations have focused too narrowly on the possible way events in an invasion might unfold and weren't specific enough on how to help the government and policymakers try to prepare for how a potential conflict may play out. Let's go to Washington now to hear from CNN Pentagon correspondent Oren Liebermann who has details from the results of the simulations. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Taiwan is perhaps the most sensitive flash point between the U.S. and China. Some experts are warning that Beijing's use of force to claim what it sees as its rightful territory is drawing closer. Chairman Xi Jinping has made it a priority for Beijing which hasn't ruled out the use of force, a decision that could cost thousands of lives for China, Taiwan, and America. A war game from the Center for Strategic and International Studies begins with a Chinese missile barrage against Taiwan's military in 2026, destroying much of its air force and navy, followed by an amphibious across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwanese forces fight back using advanced U.S. weaponry -- Patriot missiles for air defense, anti-ship missiles and torpedoes for sea defense, and its ground forces to defend the beachheads. The top U.S. general says the key to avoiding conflict is deterrence. GEN. MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF:  As long as we remain number one, then we will deter the war that people worry about, a great power war between China and the United States. LIEBERMANN:  Crucially, this war game doesn't ask the question of what would happen to make China decide to use military force to invade Taiwan. That remains an open question. But it's a crucial one to understanding the situation, especially given the West's reaction to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, sanctions that have crippled Russia's economy. Would China run the same risk given its own imports and exports, given its industrial economic power, or would it use those powers to try to control Taiwan without using its military? And that is a critical question. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: "Flindrikin" and "unbrak" are words used in Scotland to describe what? Food, snow, hairstyles or movies? There are over 400 words in Scotland for snow with flindrikin, meaning a light snow. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE: Right now, those words for snow aren't being used much and that's because it's shorts weather across large parts of Europe right now. Thousands of temperature records were shattered in an historic winter warm spell. In fact, temperatures are 18 to 36 degrees higher than average this month. In Poland, it's up to about 66 degrees, parts of Spain about 77 degrees. This is good news for the economy but bad news for Russia who hoped cutting energy exports to Europe would cause the economy to suffer. But it's not all good news. Many Alpine ski resorts have closed or at least partially shut down because of a lack of snow, and there's also concern about what this higher than normal weather means for the environment. Up next, we'll hear from CNN anchor and correspondent Isa Soares who's on the ground in Europe with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The New Year may have only just begun, but temperatures are already heating up across much of Europe. At least eight countries smashed their winter weather record, having recorded their warmest day ever in January. As the world rang in New Year's celebrations this week, climatologists were busy tracking extreme temperatures and found countries including Poland, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Lichtenstein and Belarus all reached alarmingly warm temperatures on January the 1st. Meteorologists say it's too early to attribute the extreme heat to climate change but do say the driving force is a warm air mass from Africa's west coast moving across Europe. It may look warm in the Spanish city of Bilbao, but locals are noticeably wearing winter coats, basking in the winter sun. EUSEBIO FOLGEIRA, BILBAO, SPAIN, RESIDENT (through translator):  It's not normal for Bilbao to have such good weather. It always rains a lot here. It's very cold, and it's January. And it feels like summer. SOARES:  And what would normally be covered in snow, this ski resort in France is now starved of it, forcing businesses to shut their doors to customers until conditions improve. GREGORY ROMANO, RESTAURANT MANAGER (through translator):  Sure we are, of course, a little bit sad about having to close. We had a good Christmas holiday season, which matters. SOARES:  Over in war torn Ukraine, with much of the country's energy infrastructure damaged or destroyed, millions of Ukrainians were without power over Christmas. The cities across the country, including Kyiv, broke weather records in January, which may have helped reduce energy consumption. As Ukrainian advisor Anton Gerashchenko put at it, even the weather is on our side. Just before the year came to an end, the U.K.'s Met office said last year sweltering heat, which ran rivers dry and caused a drought in parts of England, was the country's hottest on record. Though January's mild temperatures might provide some relief to the cold, meteorologists warn it could offer a glimpse of a concerning and possibly even warmer future. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, a vast array of new cutting edge technology and some just plain strange technology were shown off by companies at the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas last week. Many inventions offered a new twist on old problems and global challenges. CNN international anchor Lynda Kinkade has the story and as you watch, think about what your favorite gadget is and let me know why @CoyWire wire on social. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LYNDA KINKADE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Thousands of emerging startups and global brands are showcasing cutting edge gadgets and gizmos designed to help solve some of the world's greatest challenges from the day to day to the life-saving by taking the guesswork out of testing the ripeness of an avocado relieve anxiety with a therapeutic cat pillow that wags. SHUNSUKE AOKI, PRESIDENT & CEO, YUKAI ENGINEERING:  The more you cuddle, it -- the more excited it gets. KINKADE:  Health innovations are prominently featured, trying to brain scanning helmet that claims to detect early signs of dementia and Parkinson's. Rest your head on a pillow designed to give a better night's sleep, and watch a demo of an at-home defibrillator, a device that the company says saved 17 lives last year. JOHANN KALCHMA, CEO, LIFEAZ:  But we have developed the first life-saving defibrillator made for the home, so anyone can have it at home. It's extremely simple to use. It's portable; you can have it at home. You can have it in your backpack when you do the gym, when you go on vacation. KINKADE:  Glide past the booths on a remote controlled pair of electric rollerblades that can go about 30 kilometers an hour. And check out an autonomous wheelchair that hopes to soon transport travelers to their gate at the airport with a click of a button. JUSTIN GAGNON, VP OF SALES AND MARKETING, WHILL, INC.:  So it's an autonomous wheelchair, so passenger will get into the chair, select what gate they're going to be going to and then the chair just takes them directly to that gate. They don't need to drive it. They don't need to tell it where it needs to go. It'll just take them right there. KINKADE:  Cars have become a big part of CES, with major automakers and others showcasing cutting edge advancements and nearly 300 exhibitors expected. It will be one of the largest auto shows in the world. This year there will also be a lot of talk about web 3 and the Metaverse. So as with most of what you'll find, it will take a while before all these gadgets become widely available. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, we have a story that's going to rocket your world. Check out this rocket ride high into the skies above.

OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Hope your Thursday is off to a fantastic start. I'm Omar Jimenez, a CNN national correspondent based in New York, and I'm filling in for the one and only Coy rest of the week. We're going to be covering extreme weather in California and looking at the potential impact of social media on teens.  But first, we're going to start with news from the sky. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a short ground stop yesterday of all domestic planes after there was an outage to a system that provides pilots with notices they need before flying. Now normal operations resumed later yesterday morning, but delays from the ground stop continued into the day.  When we recorded our show on Wednesday, there were more than flight delays nationwide. The airports in Chicago, O'Hare International and Midway International Airports, were especially impacted and they continued to have a ground stop for all inbound and outbound flights into the day on Wednesday.  Now, the specific system experiencing the outage is called the notice to air missions which alerts it's about closed runways equipment outages and potential hazards along a flight route or at a location that could impact flight. The Biden administration and secretary of transportation, Pete Buttigieg, are looking into what caused this disruption and if you saw over Christmas, Southwest Airlines canceled thousands of flights stranding tens of thousands of travelers. The federal government is zeroing in on Southwest and their system to figure out how to prevent future issues like these. All right. Ten-second trivia:  Name the third largest U.S. state whose state motto is eureka.  Is it Texas, Alaska, California, or Montana? And meaning "I have found it", eureka is the state motto of California. Up next, we're headed to California where residents across the state are recovering from deadly storms that brought area rainfall totals 400 percent to 600 percent above average. The storm meant heavy downpours and strong winds forcing thousands of evacuations. Response crews were responsible for clearing flooded neighborhoods and crumbled roadways and at least people have died as a result.  Also, more than million people are under flood alerts this week and it's not over yet. Another round of rain is on the way. It's the first of four more atmospheric river events. But what does that mean? Atmospheric rivers are long, narrow regions in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles. They're expected to hit California in the next 10 days. So we'll hear now from Kyung Lah, a national correspondent for CNN based in Los Angeles. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  During recent historic droughts, California prayed for rain, but not like this.  Two days of torrential rain, thunderstorms, and wind gusts are pounding California, causing mudslides, overflowing rivers, and triggering extensive flooding.  LYNDA HOPKINS, SUPERVISOR, SONOMA COUNTY:  We've got trees down. We've got mudslides. We've got actually folks trapped in areas where we have major road failures.  LAH:  At least 17 people have died as a result of the storms, after more than 18 inches of rain fell in parts of southern California. And high wind advisories were issued on the central coast.  In San Francisco, a rare hailstorm in Haight-Ashbury. And throughout northern California -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The rain hammered here pretty bad.  LAH:  -- the rushing river has flooded, following torrential downpours. Some residents have been without power for a week. In Santa Barbara County, mass evacuations, after that storm saturated the ground. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was pouring, the wind was whipping.  LAH:  Following years of extreme drought and fires.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On the mountainside here, the debris started coming down, filling up to four feet or so. Pretty much buried the truck, and now it's starting to flow.  LAH:  More than 30 million people are under flood alerts, and across southern California, flash flooding trapped drivers. Firefighters here rescued a motorist stranded in rushing waters. And mud and rockslides creating havoc for residents.  TYRONNE MCGRATH, RESIDENT, CASITAS SPRING:  A 800-pound rock just smashed the house, it just hit the wall and blew everything out.  LAH:  In northern California, the rain flooded roads, and vineyards, it almost doubled the snow pack in local mountains, offering hope that these storms may somehow ease California's historic drought.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're riding through it. Yeah, it could be a lot worse.  (END VIDEOTAPE) LAH (on camera):  It's hard to think about drought when this is what southern California is dealing with. I'm standing on a roadway that goes back behind, me you cannot see it because of all the debris on this road. This came from this mountain, this hillside five years ago burned in a wildfire. And with all the rain and lack of vegetation, it all came down onto the street and into these yards.  The concern now is what happens in the upcoming days, with rain in the forecast.  JIMENEZ:  Up next, we'll hear from Vanessa Yurkevich, a CNN business and politics reporter, who recently took a look at social media, specifically TikTok's impact on teen brains. Her reporting focuses on social media usage and the rate of depression especially among Gen Z users. Her research comes as more than a dozen state governments have actually banned TikTok on government-issued devices and at least 22 states have taken some sort of action on TikTok since 2020.  So let's hear more about her research in the teens she speaks with on the ground. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS REPORTER (voice-over):  In just five years, TikTok has amassed more than one billion global users. Eyeballs around the world glued to the endless content and viral videos. How long do you think you spend on TikTok every day? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Two to three hours. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Three to four hours. YURKEVICH:  But last month, the U.S. government, along with more than a dozen states, banned TikTok on most federal devices, citing national security concerns over its Chinese parent company and the possibility it could pressure TikTok to hand over personal data.  There is no public evidence the Chinese government has done that but there is evidence of another risk, social media's impact on mental health particularly among Gen Z. DR. JEAN TWENGE, PSYCHOLOGIST:  Teen depression started to rise after 2012. So did self-harm. YURKEVICH:  Dr. Gene Twenge says as smartphones and social media grew, so did the rate of depression among teens, nearly doubling between 2004 and 2019. By that year, one in four U.S. teen girls had experienced clinical depression according to Twenge.  TWENGE:  What the algorithms trying to do is get people able to use the app for longer because that's how the company makes more money. YURKEVICH:  TikTok in a statement said, quote, one of our most important commitments is supporting the safety and well-being of teens and we recognize this work is never finished. We continue to focus on robust safety protections for our community while also empowering parents with additional controls for their teen's account through TikTok family pairing. Users of TikTok spent an average of an hour and a half a day on the app last year, more than any other social platform. What is it that keeps you scrolling even if you know maybe you've spent one two hours on it? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Once you watch the one video, you're like, well, time to watch another. So you just keep doing it's like a cycle you don't realize that the time is passing.  YURKEVICH:  That's exactly what happened to Jerome Yankee (ph). UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I've definitely done all-nighters on TikTok before I had just been scrolling until the sun came up. YURKEVICH:  He says he lost sleep. His grades suffered. He lost touch with his friends. He lost his sense of self. In 2021, he deleted the app. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Getting disappointed by my own life is never something I want to be doing, especially when I have the power to change it but I just wasn't because I was spending hours on this app. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have like a lot of cool resources that we give to our audience for free. YURKEVICH:  But Hannah Williams (ph) proves the positive side of TikTok, allowing her to create a business, Salary Transparent Street, providing paid transparency to her new nearly million followers. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think TikTok definitely helped just because they have such audience reach potential. YURKEVICH:  She hopes TikTok's algorithm works in her favor. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Helping people in marginalized communities is the only reason I am doing this. It's my entire mission. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ:  Up next for today's 10 out of 10, we're showing you a volcano that's erupt to no good. Yeah, even I've got to get in on the puns here. Come on. Check out this time lapse video of the Kilauea volcano erupting in Hawaii the time lapse shows smoke and lava flowing all captured by the U.S. geological survey there's something truly so beautiful about this, so hot, the temperature. As you can see the lava cooling on the surface and forming crustal plates it's fascinating science happening right in front of our eyes. Last up on the show today, you know, we got to do it. I want to give a special shout out to Kennesaw Mountain High School in Kennesaw, Georgia. That's where I went. Go Mustangs. It's been amazing hanging out with you all today. I'm Omar Jimenez. This is CNN 10. Have a great Thursday. END230113

OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. I'm Omar Jimenez, filling in for Coy Wire today. We made it to Friday. It is Friday the 13th, but Friday nonetheless. And you already know Fridays are amazing. This is CNN 10 and I'm so excited to be right here with you. Let's finish this week strong. Now, we're going to start today with the news in Washington. Classified documents belonging to President Joe Biden have been found in areas that are not authorized to store classified files. The documents which have classified markings were found at two locations inside his home in Wilmington, Delaware. Now, the files were found along with personal and political papers. The search for these documents started after similar classified docs were found at a private office of the president back in November. Now, the paperwork is from his time as vice president in the Obama administration and Biden said the documents were in a locked garage, that he was cooperating fully with the Department of Justice. Now some of the classified documents were top secret at the highest level. They were found within boxes that also contain unclassified papers that fall under the Presidential Records Act, but key questions remain unanswered about the nature of the material, including who brought these documents and what's contained in them. Last year, more than 335 documents were found at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residents, 60 of which were top secret. Republicans in Congress have accused Biden and the Justice Department of a double standard. Now, Donald Trump is under investigation for obstruction of justice for refusing to return the documents or at least turn them over. As of Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to look into an official Biden documents probe. Now, we're going to hear from CNN senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid who has more details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  People know I take classified documents -- classified information seriously. PAUL REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  President Biden Tuesday denied any prior knowledge of classified information uncovered late last year in a space he used while working for the University of Pennsylvania before he became president. BIDEN:  We want this to be a gathering place. REID:  CNN has learned that among the items discovered were 10 classified documents dated between 2013 and 2016, including U.S. intelligence memos and briefings materials that covered topics including Ukraine, Iran and the United Kingdom. CNN has reported that some of the materials included top secret files. BIDEN:  I was briefed about this discovery and surprised to learn that there are any government records that were taken there to that office. REID:  They were found in three or four boxes that also contained unclassified papers that fall under the Presidential Records Act, a source tells CNN. The vast majority of the boxes held personal Biden family documents, including materials about Beau Biden's funeral arrangements and condolence letters. The documents were discovered November 2nd, just six days before the midterm elections. Republicans pounced, launching investigations, comparing the discovery to former President Trump's retention of hundreds of classified documents and slamming Democrats. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  They have to eat their words but the hypocrisy -- think about this -- they've gotten away with so much for so long. This was discovered before the last election. REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA):  So if then Vice President Biden took classified documents with him and held them for years and criticized president -- former President Trump during that same time that he had those classified documents and only after it was uncovered did he turn him back. REID:  Even Trump's estranged former vice president weighed in. MIKE PENCE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT:  The handling of classified materials, a very serious issue for our nation and we ought to take it seriously. But there ought to be equal treatment under the law. REID:  But Democrats are defending Biden against any such comparison. REP. PETE AGUILAR (D-CA):  What President Biden did was disclose this to the Archives, let law enforcement know. That is exactly the way that you should handle this. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ:  All right. Ten-second trivia: Which of these historic figures was given the name "Michael" when he was born in 1929? Martin Luther King, Jr., Michael Jordan, Mark Twain, Thurgood Marshall? Michael King Jr., that was the birth name of the civil rights leader born in Atlanta, Georgia. This Monday, we celebrate the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. He was a Baptist minister and activist, and one of the most prominent leaders in the civil rights movement. King called for civil and economic rights, and an end to racism in the United States. Monday is a national holiday and we won't have an episode of our show that day. So, CNN's Dana Bash filed the following report on Dr. King's legacy on the 50th anniversary of his death. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  This is unbelievable. You look up there, it says Mason Temple, this is where Martin Luther King 50 years ago gave his incredible Mountaintop speech. SUBTITLE:  April 2, 1968, King gave an emotional speech at the Mason Temple in Memphis. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER:  I just want to do God's will. And he has allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land! BASH (voice-over):  That night, April 3rd, 1968, King checked in here, to Lorraine Motel. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He gets dressed around 5:45 and he steps outside of the balcony of room 306, and he speaks to other guests that are in the courtyard. SUBTITLE:  April 4, approximately 6:01 p.m., King was shot while standing on this motel balcony. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  At approximately 6:01, the final shot rings out. Dr. King lies mortally wounded on the balcony. He's taken from the balcony to St. Joseph's Hospital and he's pronounced dead at 7:05 p.m. SUBTITLE:  On the night of King's assassination, President Lyndon B. Johnson addressed the nation. LYNDON B. JOHNSON, FORMER PRESIDENT: Shocked and saddened by the brutal slaying tonight of Dr. Martin Luther King. I ask every citizen to reject the blind violence that has struck Dr. King, who lived by nonviolence. SUBTITLE:  Fifty years later, a bipartisan group of members of Congress visited the site where MLK Jr. was assassinated. REP. KEITH ELLISON (D), MINNESOTA:  To me, it's like a return into something rudimentary and fundamental. I mean, this is where Martin Luther King breathed his last breath. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In honor of, Lorraine Hotel decided not to recheck this room out in Dr. King's honor and remembrance. BASH:  This is exactly how it was left? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was left this way. BASH:  Right there when it all happened, King's partner and dear friend, Reverend Ralph Abernathy, his wife Juanita on this pilgrimage 50 years later. The night that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, you were with his widow. JUANITA ABERNATHY, FRIEND OF KING FAMILY:  Yes. BASH:  Tell me about that. ABERNATHY:  I told Coretta, I said, well, I'll meet you in your house, and I stayed there that night with her -- BASH:  So, did you sleep with her in her bed to comfort her? ABERNATHY:  Yes, right? BASH:  The night that her husband was killed? ABERNATHY:  The night that he died, I slept on his side of the bed and my little children were there with her children. (SINGING) BASH:  Tell me how you're feeling. I was watching you standing here. REP. JOHN LEWIS (D), GEORGIA:  Well, you know, it's very emotional to come here. I was not here that evening. He changed my life.  He inspired me to stand up, to speak up and to never give up. And when he died, I think something died in all of us. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ:  And lastly, we can't go until we do it, I want to give a special shout-out to Western Middle School in Auburn, Michigan. It's been such a pleasure getting to host CNN 10 for all of you. The show meant a lot to me when I was in high school. My first ever interaction with CNN was actually visiting this program and so it's a real full circle moment for me to be back here hosting for all of you. Hope your week was awesome. Have a great weekend and I hope to see you soon. END230116

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Terrific Tuesday to you. I hope you had a wonderful weekend and a marvelous Martin Luther King Jr. Day yesterday. I am back. My voice mostly back. Thanks for all the love and well wishes on my Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok. And special thanks to the Army JROTC program at Klein Cain High School in Klein, Texas. The Hurricane Battalion sent this lovely letter, and they also sent their school colors and their pride in the form of this tie. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, and we start with the dilemma over the rapidly approaching debt ceiling for the United States government. What's the debt ceiling? It's the limit the total amount of money that the U.S. government has authorized to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations, which include Social Security, Medicare benefits, military salaries, interest on national debt and tax refunds. That credit limit currently sits at about $31.3 trillion. Now, the debt ceiling can be raised, and it has been for decades hits the massive current debt. It was last raised in December of 2021, and is expected to last until at least July of this year. Well, this has set up a major battle on Capitol Hill between the Republican and Democratic Parties. Can the two sides agree to terms on which the debt ceiling could be raised again? Here's CNN anchor and chief business correspondent Christine Romans with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  We'd like to get a debt ceiling done in this work period. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  So, when it comes to the debt ceiling, it should not -- it should not be used or never be a matter of political brinksmanship. JANET YELLEN, SECRETARY OF TREASURY:  It's really up to Congress to raise the debt ceiling. CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Ah, the debt ceiling, the eternal Washington food fight. So what is it? And why is it so contentious? The debt ceiling is the legal limit set by Congress on how much money America can borrow. Because the U.S. spends more than it takes in, it borrows to make up the difference. The debt ceiling caps how much. The problem is, it's not enough. So, every once in a while, Congress needs to raise it. If it doesn't, the Treasury Department won't be able to pay all the country's bills in full and on time. Now the Treasury does have a little wiggle room before it gets to that point, what it calls extraordinary measures to move money around. But eventually, the accounting tricks run out and there's no more avoiding the debt ceiling. That's when the fireworks usually break out. REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY):  Our debt is out of control. I mean, we're talking about over $30 trillion. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA):  Me? I get rid of the debt ceiling altogether. It serves no function except to create leverage. REP. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX):  Look, they're difficult political times. Nobody likes them but they are necessary evils in a sense because it's the only time that you can actually negotiate ways to get our budget under control. ROMANS:  Now, many say raising the debt ceiling is just a license to spend more money and grow the debt but it's not really raising the debt ceiling just lets treasury pay the bills America already owes. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  There's nothing to do with any new spending. ROMANS:  If Congress really wants to clamp down on debt, it has to do it a lot earlier like before passing spending bills or tax cuts, both of which can add to deficits. Failing to raise the debt ceiling won't keep a lid on debt. It just risks the U.S. defaulting on its obligations something that could forever stain America's global reputation. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In 2005, the British travel company used an unscientific formula to determine what kind of day of the year? Best for shopping, the most depressing, the shortest, or the worst for traffic? Blue Monday as they called it was supposed to indicate the most depressing day of the year and it typically fell on the third Monday in January. Well, yesterday was the third Monday in January and while Blue Monday is a myth, some still use the marker to predict when travel purchases may peak as people are looking to escape the cold temperatures for a sunny vacation destination. The winter blues though, those can be very real. Ever hear of seasonal affective disorder? Our Dr. Sanjay Gupta tells us all about it and gives us some tips on how to make the most of the winter months and to help us find our happy place amid the wintertime grind. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Even if you love the cold and winter sports, you've got to admit, this has felt like a long winter. At least 12 million Americans suffer from something known as seasonal affective disorder or SAD, numbers probably even higher than that. Longer nights, shorter days, all of that leads to a chemical imbalance in the brain. What happens is your serotonin levels are down and melatonin, which makes you sleepy, that's up. To make sense, symptoms can be mild or severe, you can get fatigue, lack of energy over sleeping, difficulty concentrating, and also cravings for food that cause weight gain. That probably sounds familiar as well. Diet and exercise can always help. Also, get outside as much as you can. You can also get a specialty designed light box. You just sit there and stare at it for a while each day or at least put it on your desk, the point is you can get a boost of more natural light. Another tidbit, find things that bring you joy -- open up the blinds in your house, play some of your favorite music, and be with your family. Laughter and togetherness are always great therapy for the winter blues. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, is sinking into the ocean. So, the government of Indonesia has decided to build a completely new capital city in a completely different location. But at what cost? Aside from the estimated billion-dollar price tag for the futuristic smart city that the government officials are calling the world's most sustainable, critics say that the impact on the wildlife, ecosystem and indigenous people could be devastating. More now from CNN international correspondent Kristie Lou Stout. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LOU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Jakarta is a sinking city, scientists say the sprawling capital of Indonesia, home to more than 10 million people is dropping below sea level at alarming rates, mainly due to excessive groundwater extraction. The government of Indonesia has a plan, to carve a new capital city called Nusantara, out of the dense jungles of eastern Borneo. At an estimated cost of more than $30 billion, it's being designed as a futuristic smart city and touted by government officials as the world's most sustainable. JOKO WIDODO, INDONESIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  The development of the new capital has to become a move towards building cities that are healthy, efficient and productive, that are designed to be a place where the people are close from any destination, where they can bike and walk everywhere because there are zero emissions. STOUT:  Officials describe the new capital as a sort of Garden of Eden, built along the contours of the natural landscape. Nusantara is expected to be completed in 2045, and the government says it will be more than three and a half times the size of Singapore and home to nearly 2 million people. Officials and developers claim it will have minimal impact on surrounding rainforests that are some of the oldest in the world. SOFIAN SIBARANI, ARCHITECT:  We have in our -- in our guidelines is all the building, especially key buildings or government building needs to be green, green building. It needs to be sensitive to the environment. It's also futuristic. It's a future -- smart city, smart government, smart society, smart infrastructure. STOUT:  But some environmentalists disagree, warning of a potential habitat destruction. AGUS BEI, MANGROVE ACTIVIST (through translator):  The area is unique with its natural habitats and native species, and if its mangrove forests are destroyed, all the native species will be gone, too, and the next generations can only hear the stories about the species because they don't exist anymore. STOUT:  There is another concern about the project: the potential displacement of indigenous tribes. SIBUKDIN, BALIK TRIBE LEADER (through translator):  The land and the farms are inherited from our ancestors. The land is the biggest asset of our tribe. For us, the farm is the source of life. If our land is taken away, how could we farm? How could we live? STOUT:  To that, the government has said it will compensate landowners, and there are also some critics who say Indonesia should concentrate on fixing the problems in Jakarta arguing millions of residents will remain in the current capital struggling to cope with pollution traffic and worsening floods. DORINA POJANI, UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND:  Will it relieve congestion in Jakarta? Will it make whoever is left behind in Jakarta get to live a bit better? Well, I don't think so. STOUT:  As construction ramps up this year, many questions remain. But one thing is clear the road to creating Nusantara, Indonesia's shining city on a hill, will likely be an uphill climb. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. Today's 10 out of 10 is pandastic. Some baby pandas were having a tough time getting their bearings out of giant panda research and breeding habitat in southwest China. These cute cubs were tumbling, stumbling and rumbling. For all you teachers out there with toddlers or any of you with baby brothers or sisters, you know exactly the type of stress these researchers were feeling. My goodness. Pandemonium. All right. Now, shout out time. This one goes out to Washington middle school in Miles City, Montana. Rise up. I leave you with words of motivation today, one of my favorite Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. quotes in honor of yesterday's national holiday. If you can't fly, then run. If you can't run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward. Keep moving forward y'all. No matter what you're going through, you'll come out through on the other side a little bit stronger. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. END230118

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Today is January 18th, National Thesaurus Day, and we are happy, merry, mirthful, elated, ecstatic, enthusiastic, geeked up, on cloud nine, and tickled pink to be part of your day for the best 10 minutes in news. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. We have an awesome show for you today, so let's get going. We start by getting caught up on what's happening in the economy, specifically the job market. This past year, rising inflation and high interest rates made some economists fearful of a potential recession which among other things would make it difficult for people to find jobs. But in 2022, the labor market held steady with the economy adding more new jobs than many people expected. But what about 2023. Let's take 10 to break it down by the numbers. In November, there were 10.46 million available jobs in the United States, and while that was slightly fewer than the 10.51 million jobs available in October, there were still 1.7 job openings for each job seeker. Also, the Great Resignation is not over. Americans quit 4.2 million jobs and that figure was 2.6 million prior to the pandemic. We'll hear now from CNN business anchor and chief business correspondent Christine Romans who's with us to contextualize all the hows and whys of the current job market, especially in its uh recent headlines of all the layoffs that are happening across so many industries. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  It seems like every day brings another round of layoff announcements, especially in tech. Amazon, Meta, Twitter, Salesforce, Lyft, all among the companies cutting jobs. Media companies are laying off workers, too. Even consumer giants like Walmart and Pepsi are reportedly trimming staff. At the same time, the overall job market though is in desperate need of workers. There are more than 10 million job openings in the United States, about 3 million more than before the pandemic. Weekly unemployment claims are low and hiring remains robust. So, what's really going on in the job market? High profile headlines about tech layoffs don't tell the whole story. The industry hired aggressively during the pandemic and now, it's scaling back. NELA RICHARDSON, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ADP RESEARCH INSTITUTE:  It's important to note that tech is a very small percentage, 2 percent, of the overall labor market. So, tech is not a bellwether for the real economy or for the labor market. ROMANS:  Other sectors like leisure and hospitality and healthcare are much bigger, and they're still adding jobs. Those companies want to hang on to their workers, not fire them. The question now is whether the job market can stay strong. The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates to slow the economy, as it tries to fight inflation, and the Fed chief himself admits that's going to cost jobs. JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  There will be some softening in labor market conditions, and I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability. There isn't, and this is the best we can do. ROMANS:  For Powell, slaying the inflation dragon is the priority even if it means losing jobs. The Fed predicts the unemployment rate will rise to 4.6 percent by the end of the year. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, heroes don't always wear capes. We're getting a rare behind-the-scenes look into health and safety measures that recently saved an NFL player's life. Damar Hamlin of the Buffalo Bills suffered cardiac arrest in the middle of a game two weeks ago. And within seconds, medical professionals, heroes were at his side. Our Dr. Sanjay Gupta takes us to meet the NFL's chief medical officer for a detailed look at all the precautions taken, all the product protocols that are in place to protect players in America's most popular sport. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Dr. Allen Sills is the chief medical officer of the NFL. He's giving me a sideline view of the preparedness that goes into every game day. And once you see this, you'll probably never watch a game the same way again. You may have missed this pop-up blue tent. It's on every sideline. DR. ALLEN SILLS, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, NFL:  It's like a medical exam room. We've kind of made this a medical space, even in the middle of a very busy stadium. It's just so much easier to do things in here because like I said, everybody is just more relaxed. You don't have the cameras. You don't have the fans. GUPTA:  Or this, the injury review screen. SILLS:  So, we can be down here on the sideline and the spotter's booth, if they've seen an injury video, they'll queue it up for us, put on the video exactly what we need to see. We can talk to them. GUPTA:  The spotter's booth, they are the eyes in the sky. Hey. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Welcome, welcome. GUPTA:  Thank you. SILLS:  This is another part of our game day medical preparations. The real goal of this booth is to help spot any injuries or illnesses on the field. It can be hard to see the whole field from down there. GUPTA:  Right. SILLS:  Probably, to me, one of the most unique things in sports is the spotter can directly communicate down to the referee. These people can stop the game. SUE STANLEY-GREEN, CERTIFIED ATHLETIC TRAINER SPOTTER:  So, we watch every -- every play, probably minimally four times, and then we'll go back and watch it again. And so, you know, we just want to make sure we don't miss anything. SILLS:  It's always about the right people, the right plan and the right equipment. We have almost 30 medical professionals and everyone has a job to do. GUPTA:  ER doctors, orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, paramedics, X-ray techs and air-way specialists, like Dr. Justin Deaton. DR. JUSTIN DEATON, NFL AIRWAY MANAGEMENT PHYSICIAN:  So, this is the bag that I carry, and it's got a number of things that we could use. The first thing is a portable video laryngoscope. We have a portable ultrasound machine that we can use, and we also have the ability to perform surgical airways. I really have all the resources available here that I would have in an emergency room. GUPTA:  What's the biggest challenge of that scenario versus being in an emergency room? DEATON:  Well, the biggest challenge is the external environment and the chaos of the situation. When you have a larger than average size person that's lying flat on the ground and not able to be elevated to a certain level with extra equipment, plus cameras and other people around, those are really the things that make -- make it more difficult to manage. GUPTA:  How does everyone know you're the guy in charge? DEATON:  I wear a red hat on the sideline. But that signifies me as the emergency physician, the airway physician, so even the other team knows when I come out what my role is. DR. KEVIN KAPLAN, HEAD TEAM PHYSICIAN, JAGUARS:  If a player needs to get taken off of the field, the ambulance is going to be in the tunnel to your right. If you need anything at all, we'll be out there for you guys if you need us. Otherwise, I hope we have a safe and healthy game. Good luck. GUPTA:  Keep in mind, the medical team was able to get to Damar Hamlin within ten seconds. And speed really matters here. Every additional minute that someone in cardiac arrest goes without CPR, mortality goes up by up to 10 percent. SILLS:  This is a process that's in place for every single game and we train in the offseason, and just like the players train and practice, we do as well. So, I have tremendous confidence, but you always want to see a game with no injuries, and you want everyone to, frankly, be bored on the medical side. That's a good game from my standpoint. GUPTA:  I hear you. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Yakutsk, widely considered the coldest city on the planet, is located in what country? Canada, Russia, Norway or Mongolia? Located in the Russian province of Siberia, temperatures in Yakutsk have reached minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit this week. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANASTASIA GRUZDEVA, LOCAL RESIDENT (translated):  I have two mittens, two scarves. Warm shoes is a must. And you need to cover your head. SUBTITLE:  The temperature in Yakutsk, Siberia has dropped to -50 degrees Celsius. Residents of the city, known as one of the coldest on Earth, shared how they're managing the frost. GRUZDEVA:  Also, warm trousers, because the biggest heat loss is in the leg area. If your legs are cold, you are cold. REPORTER (translated):  Apart from dressing up warm, any other life hacks? NURGUSUN STAROSTINA, FISH SELLER (translated):  No, just dress warmly, in layers. Like a cabbage. ALYONA ZAITSEVA, FISH SELLER (translated):  We are freezing. But thanks to the customers we are on the move, so we warm up this way. TRANSLATED:  The mining city in Russia's Far East is experiencing an abnormally long cold snap but temperatures regularly drop below minus 40. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10 story, we're taking a trip to Wisconsin's highway 35 to meet Jeffrey the giant snowman. And Jeffrey's snow joke. He's 58 feet tall. That's more than four stories high. Drivers there are trying to keep their cool but Jeffrey freezes traffic to a halt with tons of people coming from hours away to get a glimpse and to take selfies with them -- an incredible feat by Craig Carlson and his two sons Beau and Hunter. They named Jeffrey the snowman after a loved one that passed away. Now that just melts my heart. All right. You already know what time it is. West Milwaukee Intermediate School in Milwaukee Wisconsin, we see you. Thanks for subscribing and commenting on our CNN YouTube channel. Before we go, it's #YourWordWednesday. So put your challenge word in the comment section of my most recent post @CoyWire on Insta, Snapchat and TikTok, and we're going to choose one fun word to work into tomorrow's show. I'm Coy Wire.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Welcome to CNN 10 and happy Friday Eve. It's your boy Coy. And the challenge words from your #YourWordWednesday were awesome, and this week ends with an OUS. It means beautiful. So, see if you can catch it. All right. We got a rendezvous with the news starting now and we begin in China, the most populated country on the planet. But for the first time in years, it recorded a population decline the last time deaths outnumbered births in China was during a great famine in 1961. A huge population has enabled China to produce a huge cost competitive workforce catapulting their economy's growth and this current population decline though is happening at the same time China saw its worst annual economic performance in half a century, and it's despite the government encouraging people to have more children. So, what could this mean for the global superpower? Well, China's elderly population currently makes up a fifth of its 1.4 billion people, with the number expanding to 280 million. And over the next several decades the number of people aged 65 and above is projected to surpass China's working age population and that would mean further impending troubles potentially for China's economy and their ability to grow. More now from CNN international correspondent Marc Stewart on what else this could mean for China and the global economy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The headline is significant. China's population shrank last year, the first time this has happened in more than 60 years, a decline of about 850,000 people. Let's break this down and look at some of the reasons why. First, priorities are changing. We're getting married later and some young people are not having children at all. In addition, Beijing held a controversial one-child policy until 2015, but it was relaxed because of concerns about the population. In 2021, three children were then allowed, and a plan was released to strengthen maternity leave and to offer tax deductions. In addition to all of this, the cost of living in China is high, so is education. And then there's just general economic uncertainty, that can all impact decision making. So, what are the takeaways from this? The United Nations is predicting India will surpass China to become the most populated country this year. And then there are the economic implications. This means an aging workforce without a pipeline into the future that could impact productivity and in turn economic success. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has raised these demographic challenges saying boosting birth rates and addressing the cost of raising a child will be part of future policy. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these words comes from a Latin term meaning bird? Auto, aerial, avian, or able? Avian is your answer here. It can be traced all the way back to a Latin word avis meaning bird. Did you know there's currently an egg shortage and now the prices of eggs are no yolk? One of the culprits is an outbreak of the avian flu, a virus mostly affecting birds. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the average price for a dozen eggs in California is more than seven bucks. It was just $2.35 a year ago. And one of my CNN teammates Maya in New York City, she spent $12 on a dozen eggs yesterday. That's a dollar per egg y'all. At these prices, I'm not sure those omelettes are all they're cracked up to be. Here's CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich who tells us exactly what's causing the shortage and these super high prices. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In chilly Palmer, Alaska, the demand for chickens and their eggs is heating up. DOON DYER, OWNER, POLARIS FARM:  I was already sold out even before the egg shortage. I was - I was selling everything I had. YURKEVICH:  If you've been to the grocery store recently, you may have noticed fewer eggs and higher prices, up about 11 percent last month on average from November, up nearly 60 percent in the last year. $11.49 for a dozen eggs in New York, $10.99 in Hawaii. SHANTEL ROLDAN, MANOA, HI RESIDENT:  I think it's ridiculous for it to be that much. YURKEVICH:  The highly pathogenic avian influenza, or avian flu, is largely to blame. Nearly 58 million birds and climbing have died across 47 states in the last year, a result of the deadly virus. Wild birds can carry the disease and spread it to domestic flocks when they migrate. CHELSEA CARRIGAN, OWNER, RED BARN FARM:  One wild bird coming into their chicken run and the next thing you know, 10 birds, 20 birds, 30 birds, they're just dropping dead. YURKEVICH:  Some states now recommending that all poultry be maintained indoors. Poultry and bird shows, canceled. And biosecurity around chickens, strictly enforced. SARAH SCHNEIDER, OWNER, EGG SHOP:  The avian flu is serious. YURKEVICH:  Egg Shop, with two cafes in New York City, is struggling with prices on their main ingredient. The fall migration of wild birds sent avian flu cases spiking again. SCHNEIDER:  We go through 7,000 to 9,000 eggs a week. So, it's a significant amount of eggs. And in the last couple weeks they've jumped as high as 60 percent. YURKEVICH:  How have you been able to absorb the high price increases of eggs? SCHNEIDER:  Unfortunately, we have raised all of our prices about 10 percent on our menu items. YURKEVICH:  For some, the increased cost is too much. Baked after Dark bakery in Nebraska will close its doors this weekend. STACEY JOHNSON, OWNER, BAKED AFTER DARK:  I think about what our family could afford to pay for a cookie. I take that into consideration. We can't charge $5 a cookie. YURKEVICH:  The ripple effect goes beyond restaurants and bakeries. Take a look around the grocery store. Items that use eggs, like mayonnaise, are up 11.8 percent in the last year. ANGELO PULEO, SUPERVISOR, MORTON WILLIAMS SUPERMARKETS:  From the flu to the increases in inflation, all combined together with the shortage, it is the perfect storm. VERA NEWHOUSE, NYC SHOPPER:  And I definitely have seen the prices shoot up recently. YURKEVICH:  Does that stop you from making the purchase? NEWHOUSE:  No, not at all. I'm just buying things to make a chicken cutlet. And you need eggs as the basis for that too. It's one of the reasons why there's no way not to purchase them. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, we're headed to Australia where every year in the Great Barrier Reef, corals spawn following a full moon. This is crucial because scientists said that rising temperatures have led to bleaching, and more than percent of the reefs surveyed last year. Coral that was once vibrant with pulchritudinous colors they're now colorless. Well, that does not mean though that the coral is dead just yet and a new technique just might bring the beauty back. Let's head down under the waves Down Under to learn more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUBTITLE:  For the past three years, researchers have used the annual spawning to test a restoration method called "coral seeding". CATHIE PAGE, AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF MARINE SCIENCE:  Coral spawning is the once in a year opportunity to replenish. So, it's a really valuable time for the reef but also a really important time for us to do our research. We allow coral lobby to settle onto 3D printed structures that we then deploy to the reef, and it's an opportunity for us to boost the number of very young corals on the reef and potentially boost rates of recovery on those reefs in the future. They have some protective features that might stop fish from biting them or algae from over growing them or sediment from settling on them. SUBTITLE:  So far, the technique has exceeded expectations. PAGE:  We're building year on year on our research in this area, trialing different designs one year and then building on those in the next. SUBTITLE:  The scientists seeded hundreds of corals during the reef's 2022 mass spawning. They hope their research will help restore reefs in Australia and eventually worldwide. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And today's story getting a 10 out of 10, a mirrored mirage and a camouflaged crib in Joshua Tree National Park. They call it the invisible house, 5,000 square feet of sleek design, mirrored on all sides blending into the topography like a chameleon, by reflecting the desert landscape and skies almost playing tricks on your eyes. But the inside, look at this, look at these views. From almost every single room in the house, absolutely stunning. And that's not all, there's a swimming pool inside that's 100 feet long. The invisible house has been a popular rental for lots of celebrities but now this southern California home can be all yours for a cool $18 million. Speaking of California, let's stay right there for our shout out today. Truckee High School in Truckee, California, we see you. And we hope you and everyone watching around the world can be a reflection of all that's beautiful or pulchritudinous in this world. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and I'll see you tomorrow. END230120

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. We made it. The weekend is upon us, and you already know Friday's rock. I'm Coy. This is CNN, and we are pumped to be right here to finish this week's strong with you. Let's start today by heading to Peru, the third largest country in south America after Brazil and Argentina is made up of a variety of landscapes from mountains to beaches. The multicultural nation considered the archaeological capital of South America has a population of million people. But recently, Peru is seeing some of its worst political violence in decades. It started last month with the removal of its former president and the protests have been so intense that people have lost their lives amid the violent clashes. The citizens aren't just protesting the most recent change in government. They're also upset about the political system that's governed the -- for the last 20 years. The people at the center of the protests are from the Andean regions, which are more rural and remote, away from big cities. Many experts say the protests illustrate deep divisions within this diverse country. More now from Stefano Pozzebon reporting on this story for CNN International. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN INTERNATIONAL:  Peru is seeing some of its worst violence in recent decades after the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo has led to protesters throughout the country to call for political change, particularly in the south where dozens of people have been killed in clashes with the police. But these protests are about so much more than former President Castillo. Peru has been experiencing a deep political crisis for years. The current president, Dina Boluarte, is the sixth head of state in less than five years and even if she were to go like some of the protesters are now demanding a solution to the crisis is hard to see. Both the presidency and Congress are widely discredited and are perceived as corrupted institutions. Only 21 percent of Peruvians said that they are satisfied with Democratic rule in the 2021 poll by LAPOP, a survey research laboratory at Vanderbilt University. And on one in two Peruvians, I think that the military takeover is justified when corruption is high. Even though the country has experienced an economic boom in recent years, the expectations of better living conditions have not been fulfilled. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Peru has recorded the highest per capita death toll in the world and according to the United Nations, over half of the population lack access to enough food. Many people simply think that the system is not working for them. Boluarte has so far resisted calls for early general elections and has declared a state of emergency in the areas of the country that have been most affected by the protest. The attorney general has opened an inquiry into Boluarte's handling of the unrest, and it's hard to predict how the situation will be in the near future. However, even if khan were to be restored in Peru, the root causes of this crisis still need to be addressed. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia of the three major mountain ranges in the United States, which is considered the oldest? Rocky Mountains, Appalachian Mountains or the Sierra Nevada? Appalachian Mountains is your answer here, home to America's longest hiking-only trail they're thought to have been formed around 480 million years ago. Let's go to the Appalachia Region now, home to more than 25 million Americans. The area extending from Mississippi to New York, known for its mountain terrain, relies heavily on the mining, forestry and agricultural industries. Recently though, a new industry has become a concern for some residents, the crypto mining industry, and mostly the noise pollution it creates. We'll hear now from CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir who recently traveled to Murphy, North Carolina, to speak with residents who pushed back when the sound of silence was replaced with the sound of cryptocurrency. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This is the sound of Green Mountain Farm. Certified by Quiet Parks International as one of the most peaceful spots in North Carolina. Thanks to their rare local enforcement of laws against noise pollution. Meanwhile, about 90 minutes away, beautiful Cherokee County sounds like this. It is stack upon stack of computer servers, and the fans needed to cool them. This is what's known as a crypto mine. And it makes the sound of people in San Francisco trying to make virtual money. WEIR:  How do you describe that noise? MIKE LUGIEWICZ, MURPHY RESIDENT:  We're probably sitting at probably 65 decibels right now. When it's at about 75, 80 decibels, I'd say a jet engine. A jet engine that never leaves. WEIR:  Sixteen months after the mine fired up without warning, Mike Lugiewicz put his house up for sale in frustration. TOM LASH (ph), MURPHY RESIDENT:  There would be turkeys out in the field and deer by the hundreds. WEIR:  Yes. LASH:  You don't have that anymore. WEIR:  While Tom Lash (ph) misses the wildlife -- PHYLLIS CANTRELL, MURPHY RESIDENT:  You don't sleep at night. WEIR:  -- Phyllis Cantrell says she feels trapped. CANTRELL:  You can actually lay your head on the pillow and hear it hum up through the walls. WEIR:  No way. Have you thought about moving? CANTRELL:  We're 73 years old. Where are we going to go? WEIR:  Imagine a game where the dice have a billion sides and the first person to roll a ten wins. That is essentially crypto mining. And to play that games these days, you need computers, thousands of computers running 24/7, 365. And after China outlawed crypto currency and crypto mining, more and more mines like this began popping up in Appalachia, places where the power is cheap, and the regulations are either nonexistent or unenforced. The mine has upended local politics. JUDY STINES, MURPHY RESIDENT:  I like to be behind the scenes, and I - I like to stir the pot. And I knew that we -- we needed to win an election. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Forget the noise -- WEIR:  Outrage over the mine helped flip the balance of power in November's county election. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Homegrown U.S. Senator Thom Tillis. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I do. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Congratulations. WEIR:  With the new board of commissioners now asking for federal help in ending American crypto mining. When asked over LinkedIn for reaction, Chandler Song, one of the mine's co- owners wrote, oh, boy, they wanted us so bad a year ago. As for the proposed ban, it is unconstitutional to say the least. Song and his crypto mining co-founder made Forbes 30 under 30 list a few years ago and recently claimed quarterly revenues of more than $20 million. But when asked follow-up questions, Song went silent. His mine in Murphy has not, so far. But the county attorney is looking for a legal way to shut it down. A cautionary reminder that the next time you hear a place as peaceful as Green Mountain Farm -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You're playing roulette with their lives. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's torture. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Come on. WEIR:  -- chances are someone got loud and fought for it. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEIR:  And for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, an artist that can recreate almost exact replicas of iconic marble sculptures. Here's the thing, the artist is a robot, Italian tech company Robotor created a 13- foot-tall stone chisel in Michelangelo Bernini wannabe that's recreating a famous 19th century Italian sculpture here. The 3D scans are used to analyze, assess and then carve away. The company says recreations are 99 percent faithful to the original. One thing's for sure though, they'll never completely be able to replicate the human touch. This brings to mind a thought I'd like to leave you with this week the type of person you'll become isn't determined by what you do, but how you do it. Carry love, peace and happiness with you into this weekend. And shout-out to Roland-Story Middle School in Roland, Iowa. Go Norseman! Remember, you are all more powerful than you know. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. It's been a blessing to spend this week with you. END230123

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello and happy Monday. I hope you had an awesome weekend and you're ready to start this week strong.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10 and I'm in Buffalo, New York, for yesterday's NFL playoff action. We start today, though, with news from the White House. On Friday, FBI investigators found more classified material while conducting a search of President Biden's Wilmington, Delaware home. This comes two weeks after it was first reported that classified documents were found at Biden's private office and then later again at his home in Delaware.  Also on Thursday, President Biden said there was nothing more to this a special counsel investigation has been appointed to look into the situation and here's why. According to the Presidential Records Act, presidential records belong to the government and must be given to the National Archives at the end of a president's term. The documents in this case date back to win then Vice President Biden worked for the Obama administration. After the discovery of the documents, the president's lawyers say they've given the documents to the government and are fully cooperating with the National Archives.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're fully cooperating looking forward to getting this resolved quickly. I think you're going to find there's nothing there. I have no regrets. I'm following what the lawyers have told me they want me to do. It's exactly what we're doing. There's no there there.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  This situation draws comparison to former President Donald Trump who is also under legal scrutiny for the scoring of classified documents at his home in Florida.  More now from CNN White House correspondent Jeremy Diamond. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Six more classified documents have been found at President Biden's Wilmington, Delaware residents. This time, they were found by FBI agents who were searching President Biden's home with the president's permission, the permission of his legal team. And with the supervision of a personal attorney to the president as well as a representative of the White House counsel's office. Now, all of this was revealed on Saturday night by Bob Bauer, the president's personal attorney who confirms that the FBI carried out a nearly 13-hour search of the president's Wilmington residence on Friday from 9:45 in the morning until around 10:30 at night. And those six documents being found of following an exhaustive search of the president's residence, the entire residence, we're told, they were given access to. Instead, this was done with the permission and the cooperation of President Biden's legal team.  But nonetheless, this is the fifth time in the last two weeks that we have learned of classified documents being found initially, it was, of course, at the president's former office in Washington for the Penn Biden Center. And then, of course, there was the discovery of documents at the President's Wilmington residence, and additional documents have since been discovered at that home or revealed since then. And that drip, drip, drip has certainly been problematic for a White House that has been insisting as the president did just days before this revelation, that there is no there there, insisting that he was surprised by the revelation of these documents and certainly a president who's trying to get past all this who hopes that the special counsel can do its work quietly, and ultimately exonerate him. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia:  Which of these terms refers to a group of chickens? Brood, pod, caravan, or troop? Brood is your answer here, though flock and peep are also terms used to describe a group of chickens. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  As we mentioned last week, an outbreak of the avian flu a virus affecting mostly birds is causing an egg shortage and it's a big reason why egg prices have surged. Well, I'm going to let you know about one solution some folks have found, more and more people are getting their yolks in their own backyard.  Having your own flock of chickens may be an excellent way to save some money, but some people are questioning the safety aspect and are being critical of the noise it can make for their neighbors. CNN correspondent Gabe Cohen has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GABE COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Every morning, Cassidy O'Donnell fetches a feast from her Pennsylvania yard. Fresh eggs from eight chickens, an idea she hatched last spring, as food prices surged.  CASSIDY O'DONNELL, CHICKEN OWNER:  We've seen that the price of eggs have gone up quite a bit. Now they've gotten even more expensive. So, grateful for the decision that we made a year ago.  COHEN:  The price of eggs is up a rotten 60 percent in a year, largely driven by a deadly avian flu outbreak across 47 states that's left some store shelves empty, inspiring more Americans to invest in backyard chickens, hoping to save some scratch.  MIKE HIGMAN, OWNER, MY PET CHICKEN:  What we're seeing right now is a wake up call from a lot of our customers.  COHEN:  Mike Higman owns My Pet Chicken, which sells chicken supplies for backyard flocks. He says business is booming, up 80 percent this month, compared to a year ago.  MIKE HIGMAN, OWNER, MY PET CHICKEN:  We're looking at record numbers, people are saying that prices of eggs are going up in stores, and that they're out of stock. This people that are concerned with what things are going to look like for food prices and food availability over the next 12 months.  COHEN:  Rene Ruiz built this coop last May, and purchased three chickens, with eight more just hatched, concerned with the cost of feeding his family of five.  RENE RUIZ, CHICKEN OWNER:  I just don't think it's sustainable for people to continue to just pay what they're being asked to pay in the supermarket, without having an alternative, and that's what this is.  COHEN:  But his hens haven't laid their first eggs. And he's already spent more than $1,000 on this project.  Do you think this will be worth it in the long run, as opposed to just buying eggs?  RUIZ:  Yes. It's going to pay off, not only after my first year. But just long term if I continue this process.  COHEN:  But some experts are skeptical.  Do you think most families won't actually end up saving money?  DR. BRIGID MCCREA, PH.D., POULTRY SPECIALIST:  No, the numbers don't really work out.  COHEN:  Bridget McCrea is a poultry specialist that teaches chicken owners how to raise small flocks, and she's warning them not to wing it, as costs like feed, housing, equipment, electricity, and time she says can drive up the average cost of backyard eggs to more than $20 a dozen.  MCCREA:  The reality is, that you're going to spend more money on your chickens at home than you are on eggs at the grocery store.  COHEN:  But Cassidy O'Donnell says her hens are already fluffing the family's bottom line, laying roughly eight dozen eggs each month, which could cost more than $40 in a store. Instead, she's spending about 20 bucks on chicken feed.  O'DONNELL:  So, we're saving a lot having them in the backyard right now.  COHEN:  And she expects roughly 150 eggs a month once the weather warms up, and says they'll try to sell what they can't eat.  O'DONNELL:  That's like $70 an egg at the store right now. So, yeah, we'll see a return on it.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And today's story getting a 10 out of 10 a bus for dogs. A wife/husband duo from Alaska have a dog walking business and they decided to drive around town to pick up the pups in style. CNN's Jeanne Moos takes us for a ride. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good morning Bama. JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It definitely isn't a Greyhound bus but there are hounds in it. MO THOMPSON, CO-OWNER, MO MOUNTAIN MUTTS:  Good morning, Jake. MOOS:  Nothing but dogs jumping into their assigned seats attached to leashes rather than seat belts, picking up waiting passengers with wagging tails. THOMPSON:  Good morning, Amaru (ph). Would you like a complimentary liver with your bus ride? MOOS:  Nobody said no. THOMPSON:  Jake. Dasher. Gumbo. MOOS:  This bus is better than an airline. THOMPSON:  Excuse you. You already had yours. MOOS:  The doggy boss -- THOMPSON:  Load up. MOOS:  -- is operated by Mo Mountain Mutts in tiny Skagway, Alaska. It's a husband and wife team offering dog training and dog walking. Do the dogs know their own seat? THOMPSON:  Most of them do. The new puppies don't. They'll try to just jump in any seat available. MOOS:  As they ride to outings -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, these are tangled. MOOS:  -- the bus offers the potential for entanglements. But when we watch them disembark -- oh sure, some of the passengers are rule breakers. THOMPSON:  Excuse me, ma'am, your tail is in the aisle. Ma'am, you're going to have to adjust your butt. MOOS:  But there's one seat that's off limits. THOMPSON:  Who's honking the horn? Bama? MOOS:  Bama's ready to trade her dog license for a driver's license. THOMPSON:  Excuse me, ma'am, you're not driving. Get out of my seat. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. We have two special shout-outs today. One to Ms. Bardella (ph) and her students who came up to say hello here in Buffalo. It was awesome to meet you. Also, Warwick, Rhode Island, shout-out to Whitman Junior High. We see you.  You know, I had an old teammate who used to say there's no-mentum like momentum, so let's take great energy into this day and start this week strong.  I'm Coy Wire and this is CNN 10. END230124

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, and you are awesome. We have a great show for you today, so let's get to it. We're going to begin with the news on lunar New Year. This is the year of the rabbit in Chinese culture. In China, the festivities are known as spring festival or lunar New Year because the New Year is determined by the lunar calendar. Every year, red packets of money will change hands and dragon dances will roar through the streets as people around the world usher in the New Year. The event typically results in what is considered the largest annual human migration as millions of people working and studying away from hometowns head back to reunite with family and celebrate. Lunar New Year lasts 15 days. It's an action-packed holiday with parades and fireworks and wearing red is crucial. The color red in Chinese culture is associated with luck and prosperity and, of course, we can't forget about the food. Grubbing is loving. And food is central and essential to all Chinese festivals and -- but sugary snacks man they are especially important for lunar New Year because they are said to sweeten up prospects for the New Year ahead. We'll go now to international correspondent for CNN, Marc Stewart, who has more on what lunar New Year will look like this year in China. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The lunar New Year is underway and despite a mask mandate here in Hong Kong, people are celebrating. Take a look at the iconic Victoria Harbor. People are lined up anxious to take a picture in front of the different plastic figurines. This is the year of the rabbit. There are families here. There are tourists here, all anxious to take pictures and in many cases just a few selfies. This is a big shift from last year at this time when much of Asia had a lot of restrictions, even lockdowns. In mainland China, things have opened up and as such, we have seen busy airports, busy train stations. During this roughly month-long period, it's estimated there may be as many as 2 billion individual trips out of this broader population of 1.4 billion people. While some health officials are expressing concern, the Chinese government feels that COVID has peaked in many places. As far as the year of the rabbit, it's a symbol of peace and prosperity, a wish that many people here in Hong Kong hope to share with the rest of the world. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these world heritage sites was built most recently? Machu Picchu, Great Wall of China, Chichen Itza, or Notre Dame Cathedral? Dating back to the 15th century, Machu Picchu is the youngest of these oldies but goodies. Right now, the world heritage site Machu Picchu is closed. It's among the greatest artistic and architectural sites in the world built as a legacy of the Inca civilization in Peru in the 15th century and then later abandoned. Built 2,400 meters above the sea level, the landmark site is made of approximately structures. And did you know what exactly it was used for is still a mystery to this day. This week, the government shut down Machu Picchu indefinitely as anti- government protests across the country grow. We'll hear more now from Rafael Romo, senior Latin American affairs editor of CNN worldwide, who has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR:  Peru's biggest tourist attraction, Machu Picchu, one of the seven wonders of the world Peru announced Saturday it's closing the famed site indefinitely including the Inca trail that leads up to it. Anti-government protests have choked transportation to and from the ancient citadel rail operators say they've had to suspend services because several tracks have been blocked or damaged by protests that have spread throughout the country. In the past month, dozens of people have been killed in violent clashes. The fiery protest erupting after the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo in December. Demonstrators are demanding new elections and calling for the resignation of current Peruvian President Dina Boluarte. The civil unrest has stranded tourists before. Last month, authorities evacuated hundreds of people after similar transit issues at Machu Picchu. Officials say this time around, some tourists have left by foot, but the trick is at least six to seven hours long. Machu Picchu usually draws more than a million tourists a year but it's now off limits. Peru's national treasure overshadowed by its spiraling political crisis. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, a Las Vegas family style Italian restaurant was struggling but now it has lines out the door. The owner of Frankensons Pizzeria says his dream of owning a restaurant was fading away until a local content creator Keith Lee made the restaurant an overnight sensation with one heartfelt TikTok review. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KEITH LEE, CONTENT CREATOR:  Yesterday afternoon, I got an email from an employee of a family-owned restaurant here in Vegas. I got it. Let's try it and rate it 1 to 10. SUBTITLE:  Content creator Keith Lee gave a heartfelt review after hearing from a manager at family owned Frankensons pizzeria. LEE:  Frank, if you're watching this, I'm going to be completely honest, you are an amazing man. SUBTITLE:  His viral TikTok gave the Las Vegas restaurant new life. LEE:  Let's try this food. Garlic knots off rick. These look amazing. Boy, that thing packed with flavor. I ain't going to try the ranch again because again I'm not a huge fan. This is one of the best wings I've ever had. SUBTITLE:  Lee has posted hundreds of taste testing videos, but his Frankensons review is by far the most popular, garnering 37.3 million views. FRANK STEELE, OWNER, FRANKENSONS:  So, I went out on delivery. It was just me and another girl walking that aisle because we're not busy. And the phone was just started blowing up. Come Tuesday morning, we had a long line out of our door prior to us opening up. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hey, guys how many saw this man on TikTok? (CHEERS) SUBTITLE:  Frank says prior to Keith Lee's visit, his restaurant was struggling with rent and on the brink of closing down. STEELE:  Thirty years ago, I had a dream of opening my own restaurant. Finally, this year, it came through with the help of my family. But I saw my dreams fading away because of the lack of traffic coming into my business. LEE:  That Summer, she the original employee that reached out to me. Summer, say hi. SUBTITLE:  Summer, the restaurant manager, reached out to Keith when she learned that the restaurant was close to shutting down. LEE:  The email read: I'm an employee at Frankensons pizzeria. It's really slow. We really can't afford rent and we would love for you to come and try the food. Frank, from me to you, this is my opinion. There is no way you should be behind our rent or struggling to pay rent. It is marketing. That's a hundred percent what I feel like. That food is delicious. The service is amazing. SUBTITLE:  Frank said he is overwhelmed by the onslaught of customers and hopes that the popularity will remain. STEELE:  People from everywhere and that is very emotional -- to me, but they will come out. It's support of my family and this trip is (INAUDIBLE). (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, if you love pizza, you're going to love this. Pizza Hut went to the Los Angeles Convention Center to build the world's biggest pizza. And to complete the task, workers put down layers of dough, tomato sauce, toppings then bake the enormous pie with a special heater. Let's break this pie down by the numbers. Nearly 14,000 square feet of pizza, more than thirteen thousand pounds of dough. We're talking nearly pounds of sauce and more than eight thousand pounds of cheese. At the end, it worked out to be 68,000 pieces of pizza for their record-breaking pie. And Guinness World Records confirms it's the world's biggest pizza. That is huge, for real though. Now, I'm going to be out the next two days but you're going to be in great hands, and I look forward to coming back to finish this week strong with you on Friday. I want to give a special shout out to Morton Middle School in Fall River, Massachusetts. We see you and we hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. Go out and make someone smile today. END230125

JON SARLIN, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everybody. I'm Jon Sarlin. I'm a producer for CNN. I cover tech and business, and I'm the host of the CNN business show "Nightcap". I'm so excited to be with you today filling in for Coy Wire. Thanks for having me, Coy. We got a lot of news today, let's get started. We're going to begin with the latest news on Ticketmaster. Did any of you try to get tickets for the Taylor Swift concert recently? What about your favorite sports team? Well, if you did, chances are you probably saw tickets for those events on Ticketmaster. The company promotes itself as the way to buy and sell tickets online for concerts, for sports, for theater events. But Ticketmaster is in the news this week after the Senate judiciary committee held a hearing exploring whether the merger between Ticketmaster and the giant concert company Live Nation has led to a monopoly on tickets and harmed consumers by challenging any competition. In November, you might remember, Ticketmaster halted public ticket sales of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour after a chaotic rollout of pre-sale tickets left fans scrambling and waiting hours in virtual cues for tickets, congratulations to anyone who might have gotten them. But the debacle was so bad that it did something very rare, it united members of Congress from both the Democratic and Republican Party who fear that Ticketmaster now has a monopoly, meaning that they have exclusive control of the supply of tickets. We'll hear more on this now from CNN national correspondent Jason Carroll who has more on the details of the hearing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC) JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Scores of Taylor Swift fans still haven't shaken off the bitter feeling of being shut out of the pop star's upcoming tour this month. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Ticketmaster takes the $490 out of my account but it, like, crashed. CARROLL:  All that ire directed at Ticketmaster, which bungled the pop star's ticket sales so badly last November, it left thousands facing technical issues, such as canceled tickets, a crashing site and an artist beside herself over what fans endured to get tickets. Some of those who did get them ended up paying thousands for resale tickets just to get a seat to see Swift." Now Ticketmaster is in the hot seat. Its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment's president and CFO Joe Berchtold will have to answer to a Senate Judiciary Committee about claims the Swift fallout is the result of anticompetitive conduct from a company with too much influence. SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN):  I have called for years for a change and maybe Taylor Swift fans will probably put it -- will finally put it over the edge. CARROLL:  Berchtold is scheduled to testify Tuesday. Part of his planned testimony reads: In hindsight, there are several things we could've done better. We apologize to many disappointed fans, as well as to Ms. Swift. Antitrust experts say the real issue before Congress is whether Live Nation Entertainment is a monopoly, something critics say was created in 2010 when Ticketmaster and Live Nation merged. (MUSIC) CARROLL:  While some industry insiders questioned how much one hearing is likely to change things, others say the Swift movement has already had an impact. MORGAN HARPER, AMERICAN ECONOMIC LIBERTIES PROJECT:  This is going to be the first hearing that the Senate will be holding. And it shows that this is a priority issue for folks who are on the Judiciary Committee and that they see that there are problems with the Live Nation Ticketmaster merger. (END VIDEOTAPE) SARLIN:  Next up, 10-second trivia: What region is surrounded by the Adriatic Sea, the Ionian Sea and the Aegean Sea? Is it the Balkan Peninsula, the Amazon Basin, Patagonia or Western Plateau? Well, the only option here that's surrounded by all of these features is the Balkan Peninsula in Europe. Speaking of the Balkan Peninsula, let's travel to it to the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina where one lake is experiencing an example of extreme pollution, pollution so alarming that even environmentalists are surprised. And look, ocean pollution is not unique to the Balkans, but this collection point provides a clear picture of what can end up in waterways when not managed correctly. CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar has more on this story along the Drina River where a clogged lake filled with downed trees and frozen trash is gaining attention. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Snow falls on a lake on the Drina River. From up high, it's coated with frost, but get a little closer and you can see what's underneath the veneer of snow. A massive tangle of trash clogging the waterway. Even environmentalists are surprised by what ends up here. DEJAN FURTULA, ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST (through translator):  In addition to floating waste, such as plastic, there are also various household items, including refrigerators and stoves. There's nothing that is not present. But a significant portion is also fallen trees, which are very difficult to remove. CHINCHAR:  Experts say it's a recurring problem at this spot in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are several landfills and illegal dumps near the Drina River. And after a heavy rain, the waste washes into the water and collects here. Anti-pollution barriers have been installed where the waist ends up accumulating. Local authorities say the problem will continue until there's adequate waste collection, and people dispose of their trash more responsibility. FURTULA:  In addition to posing a significant health and environmental problem, this is a source of great embarrassment for all of us. As we seem unable to solve this issue for such a prolonged period. CHINCHAR:  A lake of trash, far from what nature intended it to be. (END VIDEOTAPE) SARLIN:  Next up, we're going to talk about the future of work and what exactly that looks like. So, while many companies offered remote work and flexible and hybrid schedules during the pandemic, workers may now be entering an era of having to go back into the office. Companies from Apple to Disney to Starbucks are now requiring employees work from the office for more than half of the workweek. Last week on nightcap, my show CNN's digital show focused on business and tech news, I spoke with a CEO Ed Zitron about what workers can expect in 2023. You can also sign up for the "Nightcap" newsletter and watch the show on CNN.com with new episodes every Thursday. Let's see what Ed has to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SARLIN:  The battle over working from home has entered a new phase. Disney just threw down the gauntlet requiring workers to be in the office four days a week, beginning March 1st. Two days later, Starbucks ordered corporate employees back to the office three days a week. Other companies are enforcing mandates as well. And Jane Frazier, the CEO of Citigroup, one of the only big banks to fully embrace hybrid work, just said this at the World Economic Forum. JANE FRASER, CEO, CITIGROUP:  We do want people collaborating in and they do collaborate better together. In productivity, you can see how productive someone is or isn't, and if they're not being productive, we bring them back to the office or back to the site and we give them the coaching they need until they get their productivity back up again. SARLIN:  So, with a tight job market, workers felt like they had the power to resist mandates to return to the office. But with all the big layoffs lately in tech media and other corporate jobs, has the power shifted back to the employers? And Zitron is the founder of EZPR who has written about working from home for "The Atlantic" and his newsletter "Where's Your Ed At". So, Ed, is it over? Have we reached the tipping point where this kind of workplace tug of war has now shifted back to the employer because workers are afraid of losing their job? ED ZITRON, CEO, EZPR:  I think that there is an implicit threat from companies around this, now that there is a rockier economy that there are layoffs happening, they're basically saying, we're not going to fire you but we need you back in the office due to reasons we will probably never explain to you. The thing -- the reality is, it's not going away. Remote work is not going away, but big companies, Starbucks, Disney and so on are using their leverage here of we're a big company and you want stability to say come back in the office because it makes us happy. (END VIDEO CLIP) SARLIN:  And for today's 10 out of 10 story, this fourth-grade paleontologist made the discovery of a lifetime. On Christmas morning, while walking on a beach in Maryland, Molly Sampson discovered a massive five-inch tooth from a prehistoric Megalodon shark, meaning big tooth. The Megalodon is an extinct species of mackerel shark that lived approximately a million years ago. Molly's mom said that children around the globe have sent letters to Molly sharing their excitement at her discovery. Good job, Molly. Last up, we can't forget to give a shout out. Today's special shout out goes to Mendota High School in Mendota, California. We see you. We thank you for watching. And for you and everybody else watching around the world, I hope you have a wonderful day. I'm Jon Sarlin and it's been awesome hanging with all of you this Wednesday. Have a great day. END230126

OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's going on from New York City, everyone. I'm Omar Jimenez and I am so happy to be back here with you for another exciting day of CNN 10.  Let's get right into it. If you search for this show on the world's most popular search engine or if you're watching on YouTube, then you've used a Google product to get here. This week, Google is in the news because the U.S. Justice Department and eight states have sued Google, accusing the company of harming their competition and the online advertising market.  For years, critics have said that Google has exploited their power and thwarted any competition. They say Google has used anti-competitive exclusionary and unlawful means to create a monopoly over digital advertising and that they've acquired their rivals through anti-competitive mergers. This move is the Biden administration's first big anti-trust case against the big tech company.  The eight states span both U.S. coasts that include California, Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Virginia. And while lawmakers and regulators have express concerns about Google in the past they've failed to pass new legislation or regulations. The last antitrust complaint against Google was issued by the Trump administration in 2020. So let's hear now from CNN's Anna Stewart based in the London bureau who has more on what we can expect from Google. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Allegations that Google holds too much control are nothing new, but this latest legal broadside from the U.S. Justice Department its first major anti-trust case under the Biden administration has certainly ramped up the pressure.  Now this complaint argues that Google has actively and illegally dominated the digital advertising market for many years as detailed by the U.S. attorney general in a press conference Tuesday. MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  For 15 years, Google has pursued a course of anti-competitive conduct that has allowed it to halt the rise of rival technologies, manipulate auction mechanics to insulate itself from competition and force advertisers and publishers to use its tools.  STEWART:  Now the lawsuit accuses the tech giant of controlling too much of the ecosystem of digital advertising including three main areas. Firstly, the technology used by major website publishers to offer ad space. Secondly, the tools used by advertisers to buy that space. And thirdly, the largest automated ad exchange essentially linking the publisher with the advertiser.  The U.S. government is calling for Google to be broken up and forced to spin off at least its online advertising exchange an ad server for publishers. Google responded with a statement saying: Today's lawsuit from the DOJ attempts to pick winners and losers in the highly competitive advertising tech sector.  It goes on to say their flawed argument with slow innovation raise advertising fees and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow. Google is not new to fighting antitrust legal battles. The DOJ sued Google for its dominance in web searches in 2020. The E.U. commission launched an antitrust probe into its conduct in digital advertising last year and has already fined Google three times in antitrust cases totaling more than nine billion dollars so far. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ:  All right. Ten-second trivia. What is the currency of Russia called? The rupee, ruble, yen, or franc? It's the ruble, the basic monetary unit of the Russian Federation. We turn now to Russia's war in Ukraine. On February 24th of last year, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine and fighting there has continued in the now nearly year ever since.  On Wednesday, Ukraine received what's being called a major sign of support from the United States and Germany. The nations both announced that they're sending tanks to the front line in Ukraine. Germany plans to send 14 tanks. And the U.S. is planning to send its special Abrams tanks to Kyiv.  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called the decision a turning point in the war and President Biden in a speech said the tanks will enhance Ukraine's capacity to defend its territory and achieve its strategic objectives. The president also announced a group of 50 nations that are making other contributions in the form of military equipment and weapons. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  As you all know, I've been saying this for a long time. The expectation of the part of Russia is we're going to break up, we're not going to stay united. But we are fully, thoroughly, totally united. (END VIDEO CLIP) JIMENEZ:  And though there was no immediate reaction from Russian President Putin, a Russian ambassador called Germany's decision to send tanks in extremely dangerous decision that would take the conflict to a new level of confrontation.  We'll hear now from CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson who has more on what to expect from Russian president Vladimir Putin. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (translated):  Dear Russian citizens -- NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  Putin's biggest issue in 2023 will be feeding his war in Ukraine, both men and materiel. But a visit to an armaments producer in mid-January, he commended workers for upping output three shifts a day, 24/7. He told them they'd be exempt from call up for military service in Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands of military-aged men fled Russia last year fearing conscription.  More than 100,000 Russian servicemen already believe killed in Ukraine. It's the most unpopular feature of Putin's war so far. More recruitment may spur more resentment of him. But at the rate he burns through soldiers on the front lines means that this dilemma is only going to get worse foreign. His second biggest issue would be paying to feed the war. International economic sanctions are beginning to bite. If they chew into Russian citizens' pockets, then Putin has a problem.  The dangerous high-wire walk Putin is trying to pull off keep the value of the ruble up, keep people in jobs, it's only going to get harder. A cold winter next year, impoverished Russians on the streets risks a revolt against the war and Putin himself and this will play into Putin's long-  range concerns, an election 2024. In 2021, he signed a law allowing him to remain leader until 2036, but he has built a house of cards. Russian elections are neither free nor fair, Putin has snuffed out dissent, locked up opposition leaders, taking control of all media but even that requires mafia-style playing of Russia's power brokers against one another.  If he can't make gains in Ukraine or worse starts racking up losses, his grip on Russia's power game could weaken. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ:  For today's 10 out of 10 news, a story as old as time. The rivalry between cat and microwave? Yeah, well, we have an insane video to prove it.  So, I'm going to let CNN's Jeanne Moos explain it from here with the details of this epic story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  There was nothing micro about the epic battle waged by Bentley the cat against this microwave. He yanked it. He physically moved it. He would have certainly gotten into it if it weren't for the child lock his owners put on it to keep him out. BRITTANY SCHIESL, PET OWNER:  His body language while doing it, it doesn't seem like a cat. MOOS:  He's got this physique. He's got like a great body. Using his legs like arms, he might have pulled the microwave right off the counter if the cord weren't plugged in. No wonder this sometimes cross-eyed cat from Sheridan, Oregon, has gone viral with millions of views. Bentley has been obsessed with the microwave ever since Brittany Schiesl left pizza in it. SCHIESL:  The microwave is wide open and the pizza is on the floor and gone pretty much. MOOS:  They also had to put a lock on the kitchen cabinets where Bentley uses all four legs. Without the child lock, we clocked him getting into the microwave in eight seconds flat. Brittany says the appliance is his best friend. This story reminds me of one I did 27 years ago about Peggy the bull terrier who got into the fridge so often, his owner had to keep it locked. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And then I stick it through the hole. MOOS:  But when it's cat versus microwave, sometimes the cat moves the appliance, and sometimes the appliance moves him. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ:  And before I go, it's time. I want to give a huge shout out to Elmira High School in Elmira, Oregon. We hope you and everyone watching there and around the world have a wonderful day.  I'm Omar Jimenez. It was so great to join you all today. See you soon. END230127

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Well, hello, you lovely people. You made it. A long week is now an almost gone week. It's Friday, and you already know Fridays rock. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10 and we're going to finish this week strong. First up, a new study on our planet. Earth rotates at about a thousand miles per hour, but new research published in "Nature Geoscience" says that the Earth's inner core may have actually stopped turning and now might start to spin in reverse. What does this mean? Well, the solid inner core of the Earth is located 3,200 miles below the crust. That's roughly the size of Mars or a third of Earth's mass. And because that core is separated from the Earth's mantle by a liquid outer core, it allows the inner core to potentially rotate at a different speed from Earth's crust. The findings explain that seismic records taken since 2009 had always shown action but they're now starting to show little difference, suggesting that the inner core's rotation has paused. The speed of the inner core's rotation and whether it varies though are debated, and at least one geophysicist not involved with this study says nothing cataclysmic is happening here. Scientists believe the spin of the inner core is driven by the magnetic field and balanced by the gravitational effects of the Earth's mantle. Knowing how the inner core rotates could shed light on how these layers interact and other processes deep in the Earth. Up next, we head to China where many families are reuniting for the first time in years. This week was the first week of lunar New Year. It's the year of the rabbit, the most important holiday in China which is widely celebrated across Asia has always prompted what has become known as the world's largest human migration, millions and millions of people returning to their hometowns to be with loved ones. But for the last three years, China has been locked down due to the country's zero COVID policy. But the nation has recently loosened its restrictions so people who work or study away from their hometowns feel free to travel again to see their family without the fear of getting locked down due to the virus. My friend Selina Wang, our CNN international correspondent, is in Beijing, giving us a glimpse of what it's like to finally be able to fully celebrate lunar New Year again. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  This year's celebration is particularly special. The adults around this table all work in factories in the cities. This is the only time when many of them can see their children. The man next to me says we got to go wherever we can make money and China's Zero COVID policy over the last three years has made it all even harder. He says the policy prevented them from going home but now that the country's open, they can all be together. We came to this place in China southern Guizhou province to see how the part of rural China is celebrating the Lunar New Year without pandemic restrictions. About 1000 people live in this village and for hundreds of years, they've lived in these traditional wooden houses, and you can hear the chickens crowing and there are these ducks as well that they raised for food. In many ways, this place is like a time capsule. Its physical isolation has preserved their way of life for centuries. They're China's Dong ethnic minority. They have their own language, tradition and culture, but they can't escape the economic realities of modernity. Normally, this village is full of the elderly and young kids with most of the working age adults gone, working in faraway factories sending money home. This couple works in a factory 500 miles away in Guangdong province, making circuit boards. He tells me he hasn't seen his kids for a year. Last time he left, his son couldn't even walk. He says it's emotional to see them grow so much. For the first time in three years, millions of Chinese migrant families are finally able to reunite without the fear of COVID markdowns. Almost everyone I speak to on camera says no one around them has gotten COVID. Like this elderly woman who makes traditional crafts. She says she has not been wearing a mask and points to her shoulder saying she had the vaccine shots. But we run into another group of young people who say otherwise. The man in the brown jacket with his back turned is a doctor at a hospital in a nearby city. He says almost all of the villagers have been infected. I asked him if they just don't realize they have COVID. In response he says they've never been tested, but clearly, they had COVID symptoms. So, we've got the three government minders following us. It's common for local officials to keep a close eye on foreign journalists in their jurisdictions. But they were especially persistent in this village following our every move. So, we drive out of the village to visit a public hospital in a neighboring county about two hours away, hoping these government minders won't follow us, so people will feel more comfortable speaking freely. We walked inside the fever clinic. It's almost entirely empty. In the main hospital area, there are more people, but it's not packed. Soon after, we've realized we're being followed apparently by a whole different crew. There are at least two, three government minders. They're still following us all the way here. It's very obvious. They followed us to hospital after hospital preventing anyone from speaking to us. I try confronting them. I asked them why they're following us everywhere. And he ignores me. He's walking away. So, I tried this official. She refuses to even acknowledge my question. And what happens next talk during my interview with this girl shocks us. OK, so just interviewing the girl and then the mind literally took her away from us. The man pushes the girl and her family away, then later leaves them alone. But her interviews in the marketplace are over. China's CDC says the COVID peak across the country has passed. But in rural areas like this, experts say there's likely far more silent suffering. Whether it's in the village or in faraway factories, they're hardworking people. They'll do whatever it takes to give their kids a better life, even if it means long bouts of separation from them, making reunions like these all the more meaningful. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What is the process where pieces of ice break away from a glacier and create an iceberg? Calving, stagnation, downwasting or foliation? Calving is the answer here and a nice shelf in Antarctica just dropped a tremendous chip off the old ice block. An iceberg that's 600 square miles broke off in Antarctica on Sunday. That's the size of two New York cities or nearly the size of greater London. This type of calving was one of the most major events we've seen in Antarctica in a long time. It broke free from one of the most closely observed ice shelves. An ice shelf is a large floating sheet of ice permanently attached to a landmass. Scientists had previously discovered cracks in this particular one, but two major breaks occurred in the last two years. Researchers say this event was expected not the result of climate change and they're going to continue to monitor its every move to ensure it's safe. (MUSIC) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 deserves a round of applause. Meet Spike, a Chihuahua mix hailing from Ohio, recently named the world's oldest living dog by Guinness World Records. Spike is 23 years old. According to American Kennel Club, a small dog that age would equate to 112 in human years. Spike's owner found her forever friend abandoned and injured in the parking lot of a grocery store back in 2009 but she says he has the attitude of a big dog, hence the name Spike. He enjoys going for walks on his family's farm, visiting the cows and horses in the barn and when he has a rough day, he enjoys his favorite treats -- sausage, cheese and Doritos. He also likes taking naps. We see you, Spike. All right. Let's take great energy into this weekend. You never know who, you never know when, you never know how, but somehow, you just might be the light someone needs this weekend. Shout out to Osborne High School in Marietta, Georgia.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Welcome back. I hope you had a great weekend. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. Here to help you kick start your week with some of the top stories of the day and having a little bit of fun along the way.  We start though with some really heavy news out of New Zealand. Record rainfall wreaking havoc on the northeastern part of the island country over the weekend. Auckland, the nation's largest city, declared a state of emergency.  Look at these scenes from the airport there which had to be closed as torrential downpours have caused major flooding with numerous evacuations in the area. Several lives have been lost. On Friday, Auckland was hit with its average amount of rainfall for the entire month of January, all in just one hour's time. New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins says it's been an unprecedented event. More now from CNN international anchor and correspondent Michael Holmes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Mud on the floor, waterlogged drawers. This is what the floods left behind in Auckland. This was someone's house full of a lifetime of possessions. Residents say it took just minutes before chest deep waters washed through it. No time to save anything except themselves. REBECCA MAGEE, RESIDENT:  I felt quite helpless, never been in that situation before. It happened real fast. HOLMES:  New Zealand's new Prime Minister Chris Hipkins inspected the damage by air and on the ground and says the cleanup will be massive.  That's because the amount of rain that fell Friday in Auckland has never reached such recorded levels in such a short amount of time. The city had its worst downpour on record a burst of about 240 millimeters of rain falling in just a few hours. The heavy rains caused flash floods, closing highways, grounding flights and stranding passengers, plunging neighborhoods underwater. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The water I think is up here, but when we're trying to open that door to swim outside. HOLMES:  The waters have since receded but there are new fears in Auckland and further south where the storm has moved. The saturated ground giving way to landslides in some areas leaving houses dangling from cliffs and backyards sliding down hills. Stunned neighbors are trying to determine the scale of the damage using the drier conditions to try to find anything salvageable from their homes. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I have been in this community my whole life, 45 years, I've never seen it like this. HOLMES:  But the brief cleanup that was started may have to be on hold as meteorologists say there is more rain in the forecast. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. Protests took place in multiple cities in the United States over the weekend after the release of a video of a police encounter that happened in Memphis, Tennessee, on January 7th.  According to a police report, Tyree Nichols was pulled over for reckless driving. After an initial confrontation, Nichols fled. He was then arrested at a second location.  But in the video, officers are seeing striking nickels repeatedly during the encounter in a manner that law enforcement analysts have described as well outside the limits of police training. Tyree Nichols died three days after the incident. The actions by these police officers have been widely criticized and rallies in cities across the nation, including New York, Atlanta, Boston and L.A. have called for the end of such abuses by authorities. All five police officers involved have been fired and charged with crimes and the police unit of which they were apart has been shut down. Lawyers for at least two of the officers say their clients will plead not guilty to the charges and that no one in ended for the 29-year-old Nichols to die. We'll hear from CNN correspondent Polo Sandoval who has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Here in the United States, it was another night of demonstrations from coast to coast in the wake of the release of the series of videos showing the beating of Tyre Nichols. On Friday night, there was one incident in Times Square where at least three arrests were reported. But outside of that, according to authorities, things have remained relatively peaceful. On Saturday night, another group of protesters coming together here in Manhattan, hoping to stand in solidarity with the Nichols family, hoping that their voice makes it to Memphis and beyond.  Here's what one of the organizers of Saturday night's event told our affiliate WCBS about why they're coming together here in New York. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are out here to fight and call for justice once again and continuously because the work did not stop in 2020, it didn't stop in 2021, and it did not stop in 2022. We are still here and we are still fighting until justice is done. SANDOVAL:  New York City's police commissioner did say that they will continue to have officers out in full force, not only making sure that citizens stay safe but also so to make sure that they protect the right for these individuals to peacefully assemble throughout the city here. They did say also that they are really expressing outrage as well after seeing the video that was released, that series of videos that was released on Friday night. It's really what we're also hearing from other police departments in other parts of the country strongly condemning what the world saw when those videos were released. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: The inaugural contest of what sports competitions was held in Big Bear Lake, California, in 1997? The Goodwill Games, Rugby World Cup, The X Games, or Winter X Games? The Winter X Games is your answer here and the 27th edition of the event was hosted this past weekend in Aspen, Colorado. Nineteen-year-old freestyle skiing phenom Eileen Gu from San Francisco won two World Cup events this past week, storming back into competition for the first time since the Beijing Winter Games, where she became the first free skier ever to win three medals at a single Olympics.  Now an injury during practice knocked her out of the X Games this weekend but Eileen told me ahead of the games how she balances being a student at Stanford University, a pro-athlete and professional model. And she's also telling us how she harnesses the power of her mind to help her shine. (BEGIN VIDEEO CLIP) WIRE:  I remember in Beijing at the Olympics, you were journaling, you were writing affirmations before half pipe, convincing yourself you weren't tired. How big of a role does training your mind play in your life? EILEEN GU, FREESTYLE SKIER:  Huge, huge role. I think that for me my biggest strength is my brain. I'm shamelessly a nerd. Everywhere I go, the reputation follows me and you know, I'll take it. I definitely propagate it out there.  And at the end of the day, I think that so much of skiing is in your own head. It's an individual sport which means that your biggest rival really is yourself and overcoming that fear being able to perform on the day, learning how to deal with pressure, these are all things that are practiced and they are behaviors that I've spent a long, long time learning about how I naturally cope with them and then trying to exacerbate my strengths. So in that sense, I do a lot of journaling. I do a lot of thinking, a lot of reflection, a lot of visualization. WIRE:  You once said your wish is to inspire young girls to break boundaries. What do you mean by that, Eileen? GU:  I mean that growing up, I think so much of what you think is possible for yourself is dependent on what you see out there in the world. It can be on TV. It can be on social media it can be what you see your friends doing. I guess it's just feeling as though you're not alone, feeling that there's a place for you in the community or in the sport that you want to participate in.  For me, growing up, there weren't that many girls in the ski industry. There were a couple and I looked up to them a bunch and they really, really inspired me. But I guess what I want to do is, you know, I'm young and I'm trying to do my best and I just want to be the person that a girl at home can see on TV or on their phone and say, hey, you know, if she can do that, then I want to try it, too.  She looks like she's having fun, when can I try? And really, that's all I want to do. I just want to be out there. I want to reflect the population that's interested in it and hopefully inspire someone to take it up. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  And for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, something unbearably cute and funny. A trail cam in Boulder, Colorado, captured about 580 photos and around of them were bear selfies. Is it possible that this black bear knew exactly what it was doing? There are all sorts of poses like the coming right at you or the stare off into the distance or how about the pretty side posts, who me? There's even a hey, look at my paw, y'all. This pabearazzi was having a ball clearly. There are roughly between 17,000 and 20,000 black bears in the state of Colorado, but none of them can strike a pose quite like this one. Hey, y'all, hey. Thank you very much for all the love on our CNN 10 YouTube Channel. We surpassed 700,000 subscribers now, so special thanks to you. And salute to South Middle School in Edinboro, Texas. You get our shout out for the day.  Let's call out today and do something to make this world a bit of a better place, even if it's just making someone smile today. I'm your boy Coy, and I'll be right here with you tomorrow. END230131

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Good morning, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10 and we have a rendezvous with the news. So let's go. First up, today, we're heading to Ukraine. It's been almost one year since Russia's war in Ukraine began and there is no end in sight for the conflict.  This month, the United States and some of its NATO allies sent tanks to help aid the front line in Ukraine. The U.S. pledged 31 of its Abrams tanks, Poland said it will provide 60 tanks. The U.K. committed 16, Germany sent 14. In the United States, politicians in both parties called this move a turning point in the war and said that the tanks will enhance Ukraine's capacity to defend its territory and achieve its strategic objectives.  Fifty additional nations around the world are making other military contributions as well. The gesture was seen as a major sign of support, but some have criticized the decision saying it could make these NATO allies too involved in the war itself and some critics are asking if this means NATO is now directly involved in the conflict with Russia. We're joined now by CNN international correspondent Fred Pleitgen with the latest on the conflict. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Revving like a dragster, the crew from the 28th mechanized brigade warm up their Soviet-era T-64 for battle.  We have problems with ammunition, we're running low, the commander tells me. And that's the only problem we have. We get enough spare parts. Our commanders work all the time to sustain the tank and repair it.  That commander who goes by the call sign "David" races the 40-year-old beast towards the front line like a steam engine train.  A lot of Ukraine's main battle tanks are as old as this one. That's why the military says they urgently need those new Western main battle tanks. They say around three to four hundred to try and turn the tide in this war.  The problem, Ukraine is running out of Soviet-era tanks and is having increasing trouble replacing those lost in battle or needing repair. The 28th helped liberate Kherson in the south and then was sent here. It's already been a long war for this unit. Ukrainian soldiers on the front around Bakhmut are elated. Western nations are sending modern battle tanks, M1A2 Abrams from the U.S., German-made Leopard 2s and British challenger tanks.  But the Ukrainians are also masters at using the old Soviet tanks they have now to best effect. Firing, reloading, taking aim and quickly shooting again.  The tank engineer who only gave his name is Maksym says the soldiers from the 28th could operate these vehicles blindfolded.  If we fire from a covered position, we use this device, he says. It's old and analog but pretty efficient, very precise. Ukraine's forces say their tanks have been extremely important and effective here in Bakhmut. The tank commander says they're constantly working to stop Wagner's advances here.  We just fight against them. If we stop, they will come closer and we will lose our houses and families. We stand here to allow people to peacefully live in their homes. But Ukraine's army is under growing pressure around Bakhmut as the Russians pour more armor into this area. The promised western tanks probably won't arrive fast enough to make a difference in this battle, but these soldiers hope they will turn the tide of the war. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these is the largest continuous sand desert in the world?  Gobi, Empty Quarter, Namib or Great Victoria? At about 250,000 square miles, the Empty Quarter desert covers parts of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. Up next, we're headed to that desert in the Middle East to talk about dust storms. Our journey begins all the way in the United Arab Emirates. We'll meet Diana Francis, an atmospheric scientist in Abu Dhabi and an expert on dust storms.  Now, when dust storms hit, they can be dangerous, driving thousands of people to hospitals shutting down businesses and schools these storms know no borders and wreak havoc across the Middle East, and the phenomenon cost the region's economies an estimated $13 billion a year. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORETER:  Diana Francis is an atmospheric scientist at Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, and an expert on a natural phenomenon: dust storms. DR. DIANA FRANCIS, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, KHALIFA UNIVERSITY:  Dust storms are weather phenomena that are caused by high wind speed that are occurring near the surface over desert regions. They will lift small particles of sand and this particle will be able to travel thousands of kilometers around the globe. REPORTER:  In June 2020, a colossal dust storm nicknamed Godzilla crossed the Atlantic from the Sahara Desert. Darkening skies across the Caribbean, it was the biggest dust storm worldwide in 20 years, according to NASA, and one of a number recently wreaking havoc across the globe. In 2022, thousands of people were hospitalized across the Middle East, with respiratory problems due to a wave of deadly dust storms. FRANCIS:  In some cases, we have visibility that drops to meters and then people will feel the difficulty to breathe and we can do for example outside activities, whenever the dust storm occur.  REPORTER:  In 2016, the U.N. estimated this extreme weather cost the Middle East and North Africa region's economy billion dollars a year in damage to the environment, agriculture, transport and infrastructure. It's a problem made worse by increasing heat waves and droughts due to climate change and alterations in land use which create more sources of dust. FRANCIS:  I really wanted to know what's special about the Empty Quarter desert, what's happening in the atmosphere on the sand and the land.  REPORTER:  The Empty Quarter desert, 250,000 square miles, stretching across the Arabian Peninsula, it's the world's largest sand desert. Francis and Khalifa University are conducting what she says is first of its kind research in the region, to measure dust storms coming from the empty quarter.  FRANCIS:  So we have a meteorological tower on which we have several sensors at different levels, so it allows us to have the vertical structure of the atmosphere.  REPORETER:  That data helps predict dust storms in the region and further afield. Her work on dust is even more important in a region where solar power is emerging as a green energy source.  FRANCIS:  We know that solar energy efficiency is impacted by dust storm and if we want to understand how much we can rely on these energy sources we need to be able to predict dust storms, and their activity.  The story about studying the weather is a new end story because there is always something new, something novel to discover. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, we've definitely heard of a neighborhood cat getting caught in the tree. Well, now, we have a dog -- meet Izzy, who is probably feeling dizzy when he realized he was high up in a tree. Oh what a tizzy. He was lost in his own little world, just trying to have some fun as he was chasing after squirrels but then he got stuck. But Izzy was in luck, first responders came to save him with their little fire truck, and they even brought Izzy some snacks. Shout out time now. High five and a high 10 to Morgan City High School in Morgan City, Louisiana. Go Tigers. Hope you have a happy day. And remember happiness isn't some ideal we have to chase or create. Happiness is right here, right now, whenever we choose to embrace it. Much love, many blessings.  I'm Coy, and this is CNN 10. END230201

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. It's your boy Coy, wishing you a wonderful Wednesday. We're halfway through the week so let's lock in and keep aiming to be a little better today than we were yesterday. Time now for the best 10 minutes in news, and we start today with what is being called a triple threat of winter weather in the United States. More than 40 million people from New Mexico to West Virginia are under various forms of winter weather alerts. Roads in many of these places were considered very dangerous. And one person has already lost their life in a 10-car pileup in Austin, Texas.  Since Monday, EMS crews in the Dallas-Fort Worth area have responded to at least 142 traffic accidents while the forecast shows there will be periods of reprieve over the next two days. Roads will likely be dangerously slick throughout the storm as temperatures remain low.  Millions of people across the southern and central parts of the nation are bracing for an ice storm which could pose a triple threat: ice, sleet and snow. Officials have already closed schools and roads in anticipation of the conditions. In fact, driving in certain areas is already so dangerous in large part because many cities and towns, they're just not equipped to handle this kind of weather. So please tell your family and friends to be careful. Now, let's talk about a different type of storm, hurricanes. Today, we're highlighting a community that's built to withstand them. Babcock Ranch in coastal Florida calls itself America's first solar-powered town and it never lost any power during the devastating hurricane Ian which wreaked havoc on communities all around it.  The town which is located 12 miles inland from Fort Myers has streets that are specifically designed to funnel flood waters away from houses. And landscaping -- well, that's designed to guard against storm surge many of us have either been directly impacted or know somebody who's seen their home or business destroyed by hurricanes, but could the way we design cities be the answer? CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir traveled to Babcock Ranch which is designed to weather the weather. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  When Hurricane Ian brought gusts over 150 miles an hour, much of the power grid in its path did not stand a chance.  Look at that.  And thanks to two feet of rain, even communities miles from the storm surge could not escape life-altering floods.  But even as white caps ripped across the lake in Anthony Grande's (ph) backyard, he was chilled out in front of the TV.  ANTHONY GRANDE, BABCOCK RANCH RESIDENT:  You know, that's one of the things I said to my wife when we were -- were sitting there watching TV, I'm like, I don't have any fear right now.  WEIR:  Anthony and the 2,000 families around him never lose power and did not flood because they live in Babcock Ranch, a community about 15 miles from Ft. Myers, which is 100 percent solar powered.  GRANDE:  I even held on to my generator not knowing what was really going to happen. So my wife was like, get rid of it. I'm like, no, I'm not getting rid of it. I'm not doing it. That's what we -- we go through the test. And this was the test. WEIR:  This was the test. GRANDE:  This was a big test. So. WEIR:  And now you can let go of the generator?  GRANDE:  I did. I gave it to a friend.  WEIR:  Jennifer Langwell (ph) was nervous during the storm because with a Ph.D. in civil engineering, she helped design this place.  JENNIFER LANGWELL, BABCOCK RANCH RESIDENT:  I literally got my construction drawing out and I looked at the wind load that my house was designed to, and I looked at my finished floor elevation, and I looked at the road elevation, and I just mentally was crunching numbers because I was like, this is going to be bad.  WEIR:  And it was. But their interconnected lakes and protected wetlands saved them from flooding. And the 700,000 solar panels in their 150 mega-  watt array all held solid.  I always assumed that solar panels and hurricanes don't mix, that it would turn them into projectiles, but you didn't lose any or -- LANGWELL:  No. That's the beautiful thing about engineering, right, is that you understand the wind loads and you understand the stress and the strain and you design to that.  WEIR:  This place is the brain child of Syd Kitson, an NFL offensive lineman turned developer, who bought a massive cattle ranch, sold most of it to Florida as a nature preserve, and set out to build the cleanest, most resilient town in America.  GRANDE:  Here's the elementary school. We have a field house over there which is now housing people as a shelter.  WEIR:  Right. I guess it's fitting that the mascot of Babcock High are the Trail Blazers.  GRANDE:  Trail Blazers. Everything's very well thought out here.  WEIR:  I've got to say, my heart still breaks. I feel a little guilty leaving the damage -- GRANDE:  Right. WEIR:  But it's a relief to come to a place unscathed like this.  GRANDE:  Yes, we're feeling the guilt to being out here. WEIR:  Are you? GRANDE:  Yes, absolutely. Yes. I mean we've certainly got it really good out here. LANGWELL:  It's unfortunate to feel guilty about it. I feel relieved that we're not adding to what first responders have to deal with and that we're able to help the community. So, we have people here making meals. We're taking in laundry from sheriffs and firefighters that are in from out of town. Because we were resilient, because we were durable, we're able to help in that way.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these sports invented in 1965 is the official state sport of Washington? Tennis, squash, pickleball or badminton? Pickleball was created on Bainbridge Island, Washington, by Joel Pritchard and some friends as a backyard game for kids. Today's story getting a 10 out of 10. Aunt Nora, a passionate prize-winning pickleball playing prodigy giving us some tips on how to dominate in the fastest growing sport in America via her niece, CNN senior producer Janelle Davis. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JANELLE DAVIS, CNN SENIOR PRODUCER (voice-over):  Pickleball is the fastest growing U.S. sport with about 5 million players. This addicting game is a mashup of tennis, ping pong and badminton. I even got hooked and I'm lucky to take my game to the next level. Lucky for me, I have a national competitor in my family. That's Aunt Nora in the white skirt. We go way back. Clearly, she's going easy on me here but at just under five feet, she dominates on the court and has won countless trophies. NORA DAVIS, NATIONAL PICKLEBALL COMPETITOR:  I will play five days a week, anywhere from two to five hours a day. I am truly an addict. J. DAVIS:  She lives in Washington state, the birthplace of pickleball and here are her three tips to take your game to the next level. Number one: add spin to your dink. Okay let's back up for the newbies watching. This part of the court is the non-volley zone, known as the kitchen. Experienced players keep the ball low and get in an offensive position near the kitchen, giving your opponent less time to react. Shots for this is called the dink, a short soft hit into your opponent's kitchen. Here's how it's done -- N. DAVIS:  You're going to get low and then you're going to come up and lift it like you would. But instead of stopping right there, you're going to roll your hand forward. J. DAVIS:  That spin makes your shots lethal. To practice, play a game starting near the kitchen hitting dinks back and forth, keep it low and slow. You'll learn accuracy and patience. N. DAVIS:  You need to have a lot of patience with your dink shots. Your opponent will make a mistake before you do if you have patience. J. DAVIS:  Number two, master the drop shot, one of the hardest shots. The drop is a soft hit from deep in the court that drops into your opponent's kitchen, allowing you to explode towards the net and go on the attack. N. DAVIS:  To do the drop shot, you want to get low and lift just to your chest.  J. DAVIS:  You'll need a loose grip, control swing and to get low, being short like my eye helps too. Number three, time your split step. That's the ready position. You don't want to be moving as you hit the ball. You want to be stabilized. The best players can predict where the ball is going and quickly position themselves for the return.  Now, you're ready to play. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. Today, it's officially Black History Month and February 1st is National Freedom Day, honoring the signing of the 13th Amendment by President Abraham Lincoln which abolished slavery in the U.S.  Today is also hashtag your word Wednesday.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. It's Thursday. So happy Friday eve. I'm Coy Wire. And we're going to start this day with a shout-out to all the teachers out there, keep uplifting, guiding and inspiring. You're so money, baby. Students, dap up your teacher today, give them a handshake or high five and let them know you appreciate them. Speaking of money, let's start today by talking about the debt ceiling in the United States. In case you're still unsure about exactly what the debt ceiling is, we've got you covered. You can also call it the government's debt limit. It's the total amount of money the United States government is authorized to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations, like paying for military salaries, tax refunds, Social Security and Medicare benefits, and interest on the national debt among other things. But once the debt limit is reached and if the government can't borrow any more money, that means the government could fail to make payments, fail to take care of its own obligations by defaulting on all national debt, and that would greatly impact the U.S. government's reputation across the globe. We'll hear more now from White House correspondent Arlette Saenz on what the United States government could be facing in the near future and what the impact could be. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are heading towards a high-stakes showdown over the debt ceilings. This will be the first time Biden McCarthy are meeting in person since McCarthy became House Speaker and both sides have said the debt limit will be on the table. Now both men have said that they don't want to see the nation default on their debts but for the time being they disagree on how to get there. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has insisted that he believes there should be negotiations and that ultimately, they believe that there need to be spending cuts if the debt ceiling will be raised. But President Biden and the White House have insisted that there will be no negotiations over this, and that Congress must fulfill their obligation to raise the debt ceiling. A spokesperson for the White House saying in a statement, quote, the president will ask Speaker McCarthy if he intends to meet his constitutional obligation to prevent a national default, as every other House and Senate leader in U.S. history has done, and as leaders McConnell Schumer and Jeffries have pledged to do. The president, they add, will underscore that the economic security of all Americans cannot be held hostage to force unpopular cuts on working families. Now, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that they are using extraordinary measures until this moment and that the nation's debt limit must be raised by early June. So, certainly this could have huge ripple effects for the U.S. economy if the nation were to default on their debt. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Okay, imagine trying to find a tiny capsule just eight millimeters long and trying to find it on an enormous highway in Australia. Now, imagine the pressure when this tiny capsule is filled with a highly radioactive material. A capsule containing cesium-137 which can cause serious harm went missing as it traveled hundreds and hundreds of miles from a mining site to Perth, the capital of Western Australia. Authorities said this would have been like trying to find a needle in a haystack. So, was this search worthless? Was this mission just an exercise in floccinaucinihilipilification? Or did they find this elusive capsule after all? Here's CNN international correspondent Marc Stewart with the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The radioactive capsule has been found and to give you some context, this is a Hong Kong coin similar in size to a U.S. dime. It's that small. It is used in mining. Here is the history: the capsule was discovered six days after authorities realized it went missing, likely after falling off a truck. Eventually it was found off the side of a road by crews using radiation detection equipment. It was found not far from the Rio Tinto mine, suggesting it fell off the truck soon after it left on January 12th. But the potential search area was enormous a distance longer than the California coastline. A perimeter was set up and now the goal is to transport it in a lead container to a health department facility in Perth. This was concerning because human exposure could cause skin burns, radiation sickness. There's even a cancer risk in some cases. Authorities felt the chance of finding it was slim now they must determine how this happened in the first place. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which airplane model was the first airplane to be considered a jumbo jet? 747, DC-10, 737, or A380? With its first flight on February 9th, 1969, the 747 is your answer here. It was called jumbo jet as it was the first wide body airliner. And up next, we will salute the queen of the skies, the Boeing 747. This spacious and sleek aircraft that was once touted as the future of airplane travel when it took off in 1969 is now a plane of the past, as airlines are opting for more fuel-efficient alternatives. This week, Boeing completed and delivered the last 747 to ever be built. And on Wednesday, the plane flew a path spelling out on the flight tracker to commemorate the moment. Let's learn more about the history of this jumbo jet and what's in store for the airlines of the future. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  When it was revealed in 1969, it broke the mold and defined jumbo. It brought jet travel to the people, carried world leaders, cultural icons, and even spacecraft. For half a century, it was the queen of the skies. But now, the last model has been delivered, Boeing 747 is beginning to approach its final touchdown. Built to meet the boom in demand for air travel in the 1960s, the 747 was a giant that needed the world's largest factory to match its jumbo proportions, 225 feet from nose to tail it had a wing surface bigger than a basketball court, and its innovative wide body double aisle and double deck design would allow it to carry up to 500 passengers, while ensuring it would also be a freight hauling behemoth with looks like no other. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Pan-am will bring you the plane with all the room in the world, before you know it. REPORTER:  Taking to the skies for its first commercial flight in 1970, the 747 cut airfares in half and opened up a world of affordable air travel. Airlines across the globe clamored to have a jumbo jet in their fleet, and airports and their equipment had to be modified to accommodate its enormous size and passenger capacity. But spacious interiors, a trademark spiral staircase and superior service also had the world's rich and famous flocking. Glamorous silver screen appearances cemented its lavish reputation, and it became the go-to transport for many of the world's elite, a trend set to continue with the presidentially modified Air Force One. The 747 was so capable, it was even used to transport NASA's space shuttles and it continues to be used to launch satellites with Virgin Orbit. But the queen of the sky's days of carrying passengers are entering their final chapter. Sales of the redesigned 747-8 failed to take off, with airlines opting for more fuel-efficient two-engine alternatives. Pandemic travel lockdowns grounded much of the remaining fleet and the last made like most still in service will be used to fly cargo. And so, after half a century of service, the sun is beginning to set on Boeing 747. It'll be remembered as one of the most important airplanes ever made. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And today's story getting a 10 out of 10, a Rorschach test from Mars. What do you see when you look at this photo of a rock formation on Mars? A Rorschach test is a psychological test where a person looks at ink blots and then reveals what they see and psychologists analyze the answers to examine a person's personality characteristics, it's all in the eyes of the bear holder. What this actually is that we're seeing is a circular fracture on the surface of Mars, with craters. This high-resolution photo was captured by a reconnaissance orbiter, a spacecraft designed to search for the existence of water on Mars as part of NASA's Mars exploration program. All right. So many great your word Wednesday submissions yesterday. Thanks to Ms. Spicer's civics class at Hughes. Today's word is floccinaucinihilipilification. And this is a noun, one of the longest words in the English language, not easy to pronounce, it means the estimation of something as valueless. Well done, everyone.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. You made it to Friday, and you already know Friday's rock. This is the first Friday in February, one of the coldest months in the year for many Americans but it's also a month that celebrates love and appreciation. So, we're sending you our love and appreciation. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. Let's finish this week strong. We're going to begin today's episode by talking finance, specifically about interest rate hikes. An interest rate is what banks get paid by the people who borrow money from them. In the United States, the Federal Reserve System is the central banking system for the entire country. It was created on December 23rd, 1913 with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act as a way to protect against future financial crises. When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, it means people have to pay back a higher percentage of the money they borrow. Why would the Fed want to do that? Well, because of inflation. The thinking goes that if interest rates are higher and it's more expensive for people and businesses to borrow money, they'll spend less of it and inflation will settle back down. The cost of living in America has gone up significantly as prices of things we buy have risen. We'll hear now from CNN business reporter Matt Egan. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER:  The Fed's war on inflation isn't over but it is shifting. This 25-basis point rate increased from the Fed is the smallest since this fight against inflation began back in March. Now, the Fed is still trying to slow this economy down to knock inflation down. But it's gone from slamming the brakes on the economy to tapping the brakes and that is an important shift because it lowers the risk that the Fed ends up causing an accident, either in financial markets or in the real economy or in both. And the Fed is changing its tune on inflation a bit. The statement says that inflation remains elevated, but it also concedes that it has eased. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Okay. Did you know tsunamis can travel thousands of miles at speeds up to 500 miles per hour. A tsunami is a series of waves usually caused by an underwater event like an earthquake or a volcanic eruption and they can cause serious damage to communities that are hit by them. More than 700 million people live in coastal areas that could be exposed to tsunamis. So, imagine how powerful it would be if we could predict them. We're traveling to Tonga, a Polynesian country that's part of an archipelago of islands to hear about the work of the folks at the Tonga Geological Society who are studying the ocean floor to get a better sense of what causes tsunamis. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  Late December, in the middle of the South Pacific, an underwater volcano is active once again. Two weeks later, a series of eruptions will reverberate around the planet and be visible from space. Tsunami warnings were issued across the Pacific and the next afternoon, a series of waves hit the island country of Tonga, some as high as 15 meters, killing three people and leaving mass destruction in their wake. When the dust had settled a few months later, a ship from New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research or NIWAR set sail to find out what had triggered the eruption. Marine geology technician Erica Spain was on board. DR. ERICA SPAIN, MARINE GEOLOGY TECHNICIAN, NIWA:  The voyage up to Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai, an active volcano, was really exciting. It's a multi-  disciplinary voyage. So, you've got multiple science streams working together to try and figure out what was going on and why it erupted so violently. There are the multi-beams on either side. REPORTER:  Spain's mission was to map the sea floor around the volcano using a machine called a multi-beam echo sounder. SPAIN:  An acoustic pulse, so a ping or a sound is emitted or sent out from the bottom of the ship and then it echoes effectively off the sea floor and then we have hydrophones or a listening ear that receives that echo and from that we can determine how deep the sea floor is and build up an idea of its shape and geometry. Every volcano has a different trigger in terms of when it might erupt, and by mapping Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai and then comparing that to other volcanoes, we can begin to build up a better image of what these triggers might be or what they might look like on the sea floor. REPORTER:  Mapping, taking rock samples and filming underwater all help build a bigger picture of what happened here. SPAIN:  So, you have to become a seafloor detective to piece all those small parts together. REPORTER:  That detective work can help countries like Tonga better prepare for tsunamis. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: The vernal equinox marks the start of what season? Spring, summer, fall or winter? Happening on March 20th this year, the vernal equinox marks the start of spring. Bye, bye wintertime. Yesterday, February 2nd was Groundhog Day. On this day, some people predict when winter will come to an end by watching a groundhog. In Pennsylvania, my home state, one of the most notorious groundhogs of all time, Punxsutawney Phil. Each year in a tradition derived from a Pennsylvania Dutch superstition, people watch to see how the groundhog emerges from its burrow and whether or not the furry creature sees its shadow well that will determine when winter will end and spring begins. February 2nd isn't just some random day. It falls at the midpoint between the winter solstice and the spring or vernal equinox, making it the ideal time to consider when springtime might finally come. We're going to meet up with one of our in-house experts now to break it all down and find out what Punxsutawney Phil had in store for us this time. All right. The forecast in the hat you've all been waiting for, we're here with friend of the show, CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. And here it is, Punxsutawney Phil officially predicts six more weeks of winter after seeing a shadow Thursday morning. ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  That's right. Now, the legend goes, if the groundhog sees his shadow, which he did this morning, we will have six more weeks of winter. But if there had not been a shadow, spring would actually arrive early. Now scientifically speaking, winter will officially come to an end on the equinox, on March 20th, regardless of what Phil predicts but Mother Nature doesn't always follow the timetable and neither does Phil. WIRE:  All right. So, what if we don't like his forecast? CHINCHAR:  Okay. So don't worry because he's actually usually wrong. In the past, Phil has been way more likely to see his shadow than not in fact. He's reportedly seen his shadow 105 times, but not seen his shadow only 20 times. Statistically speaking, Phil has only been correct in his forecast about 40 percent of the time in just the last years. WIRE:  That's not very good, Phil. Sorry. The interesting thing here is also the Phil's not the only forecasting groundhog. In fact, there are many others just like him. He has competitors in states like Georgia, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio and some states they're not even groundhogs, they have nutrias, they have possums, they have ducks and a lobster? CHINCHAR:  I'm not sure how you'd see that shadow, not so much. Now some of the more colorful names include PRC shadow of Louisiana, General Beauregard Lee of Georgia, and Staten Island Chuck from New York just to name a few. And ultimately quite what this means is if you don't like Phil's forecast, chances are you'll like one of the other forecasters' forecasts just as well. (MUSIC) WIRE:  And for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, scientists have invented a shape-shifting robot. Check this out. The robot was presented as part of the research on metal micro particles, and it's made from gallium, a metal with a low melting point. The robot is able to move via the use of magnets. Scientists hope that one of the areas this type of drippy droid could help would be surgeries believe it or not, potentially making them more effective and safe. And their inspiration for all this? A sea cucumber. What in the world? All right. Special shout out now to Sycamore Middle School in Sycamore, Illinois. We see you. It has been awesome learning with you this week. Let's finish this day off right and take boundless energy into the weekend. And remember, you are more powerful than you know. I'm Coy Wire, and it's been a blessing to spend this week with you.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, lovely people. Hope you had a wonderful weekend. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, and we're grateful to be here to help you make this an awesome week. First up today, the latest on the dramatic takedown of a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had been flying across the United States over the past few days. The U.S. government ordering an F-22 fighter jet to use a heat- seeking missile to blast the balloon out of the sky, and that's exactly what happened on Saturday. Some witnesses were caught off guard by the delayed sound of the explosion. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That plane just -- had a strike.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't see the balloon anymore. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I just got it on video. I did, all right? The balloon is gone. (EXPLOSION) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Whoa! Did you hear that? Are you still video? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I am still videoing. The sound just hit us. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Okay. So how did we get here? Well, last week, the U.S. government confirmed it had been tracking the 90-foot balloon which was first spotted over Montana on Wednesday. The suspected spy balloon from China even flew over a number of sensitive U.S. military sites over the course of a few days.  China's defense ministry spokesperson though has protested the shoot down saying the balloon was a civilian weather aircraft which flew off course by accident, but U.S. officials maintained that the balloon was being used for surveillance purposes.  There was much debate about what the U.S. should have done about the balloon, including calls to shoot it down immediately with critics of President Biden saying the decision to allow the balloon to fly over the country for days was, quote, weak. But top U.S. military officials have said that the balloon posed no military risk and that they were taking steps to protect against any collection of sensitive information, and they wanted to wait until the balloon was over water to protect civilians from any potential falling debris after a shoot down. So, on Saturday, the U.S. military did shoot that balloon down off the coast of South Carolina. Afterwards, China saying that the U.S. government overreacted and seriously violated international practice. The U.S. secretary of state had canceled a trip to China after the appearance of the balloon on Thursday, so this event is causing even more tension between the two nations. A second balloon carrying similar surveillance equipment has been seen flying over Central and South America and a senior U.S. defense official said Saturday that China flew surveillance balloons over the United States in three instances during the Trump administration but never for this long. All of this is raising questions about these aircraft and the threat they might pose. Here's CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  President Biden told his top military leaders in a meeting on Wednesday to shoot down that Chinese spy balloon transiting over the U.S. as soon as possible. The president heard advice from military leaders who warned that shooting anything down over land, over ground could pose a risk to American lives so ultimately the president heeded their advice and waited to have this balloon shot down until it was over the waters on Saturday afternoon. President Biden was briefed on those final plans, Friday evening. And ultimately, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin gave that final go-ahead shortly after noon on Saturday. Now, the president was flying on Air Force One from Syracuse, New York, to Maryland, and was on the phone with his top officials as this operation was underway. And here's what he had to tell reporters about the considerations given to that decision. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  On Wednesday, when I was briefed on the balloon, I ordered the Pentagon to shoot it down on Wednesday as soon as possible. They decided -- without doing damage to anyone on the ground, they decided that the best time to do that was they got over water outside -- within our -- within the 12-mile limit. They successfully took it down and I want to compliment our aviators who did it and we'll have more to report on this a little later. Thank you. REPORTER:  Mr. President, what do you say about China? What's your message to China? REPORTER:  You were saying the recommendation from your -- was from your national security -- BIDEN:  I told them to shoot it down. REPORTER:  Oh Wednesday? BIDEN:  On Wednesday. REPORTER:  But the recommendation -- BIDEN:  They said to me, let's wait until the safest place to do it. SAENZ:  Republicans were quick to criticize President Biden for not taking steps to down this balloon sooner. Republicans have argued that this is a sign of weakness in the White House's approach towards China.  But the White House has pushed back, saying that this was a responsible action for a commander-in-chief to take. They are arguing that what the president was trying to do was prioritize saving American lives. Now, there are lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who are calling for briefings and hearings into this matter and the so-called Gang of Eight congressional leaders will receive a briefing from Biden administration officials next week, as there are still so many outstanding questions about how this incident unfolded. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  This is the portion of this balloon that investigators want to get their hands on, that payload -- a central core and what looked like a couple of solar arrays on either side. When the balloon was destroyed, you could clearly see it falling away below.  Now if this had the mass of a human like a skydiver, it might be falling at 100, 150 miles an hour, something like that. If it had the mass of a couple of cars, its terminal velocity might have been more like 500 miles an hour or up from that. What that means is when it got to this area, just off Myrtle Beach, the water would be essentially like concrete, it would hit it with tremendous force and be absolutely misshapen, torn apart, broken up by this impact. What does that mean to recovery? What it means is the first thing they have to do when they get settled out there is get divers down 47 feet down. That's good. That's a good workable depth.  There, they have to look at this, figure out how many pieces it's in, where they are, assess it, figure out if some of it is buried down in the muck below, and then come up with a list of priorities. What do they want to bring up first? How do they want to bring it up to protect all of this as much as they can and how long it's going to take? These operations typically are longer than most people expect even though they believe this one could be pretty fast. Think of it this way, this is like an underwater crime scene now, and they have to protect their evidence as best they can if they want to learn all they can about this balloon. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these locations holds the current record for the highest officially registered temperature? Kuwait, Iran, California, or Texas? California's Death Valley hit 134 degrees Fahrenheit in 1913, at a location appropriately named Furnace Creek Ranch. Right now, it is far from blazing in the United States, especially in the Northeast where there have been record low temperatures this past weekend. Take a look at these numbers, a cold front brought dangerous wind chill temperatures throughout New York, the New England states, and up into Canada. This cold front comes a week after an ice storm in Texas canceled flights and left hundreds of thousands of homes without power. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Record low at temperatures across the region, but here in New York City, right outside of Central Park, people have been doing what they do best here in New York. They have been braving the elements all day. I've been speaking with tourists and New Yorkers who are unfazed by the cold temperatures.  All day, I've been watching my friend here Gamal (ph) who is running this hot dog cart here. He had a hard time this morning trying to get it set up because his generator had actually frozen, the oil in the gas that was inside of it. He had a hard time getting it set up.  And he's told me that business is a little bit slow today, right? Not so good not many people out here in these cold temperatures, and just take a look -- this bottle of water -- frozen solid. It has been frozen all day. That should give you an idea of just how cold it is here.  But as I said, New Yorkers, those who are visiting for the most part taking it in stride. If you are going to go outside in these very cold temperatures, to dress appropriately, wear your layers and if you don't need to, it's probably best to stay home. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, let's go to Mount Washington, New Hampshire, where it was colder than a polar bear's toenail. Coldest wind chill ever recorded in the United States, negative 108 degrees Fahrenheit. This happened over the weekend, wind gusts reaching 98 miles per hour. That would be like a category 2 hurricane.  Experts say it would take less than 60 seconds to get frostbite in those temperatures. One meteorologist there said that his wrist was exposed between his coat and gloves and it felt like being continuously stung by a bee. That is unbeelievably cold.  All right. You already snow what time it is. Shout out to Bucks County Technical High School in Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania -- rise up. We only get 86,400 seconds in a day, and when they're gone, they're gone forever. So live with a sense of urgency today. Don't take any moment for granted.  I'm Coy Wire, headed to Phoenix.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, lovely people? Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN, coming to you from Phoenix, Arizona, this week - - home to cacti, beautiful skies, Super Bowl LVII this Sunday and much, much more. Now behind me is Piestewa Peak, one of the highest points of the Phoenix Mountains, named in honor of Lori Ann Piestewa, a United States Army soldier who became the first known Native American woman to die in combat while serving our nation. We're going to start with the latest news out of Turkey, a country that sits partly in Asia and partly in Europe. A powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake occurred Monday in Turkey and parts of Syria, which collapsed thousands of buildings, killing more than 3,000 people. It created a new humanitarian disaster in a region already strained by war, a refugee crisis and deep economic troubles. Turkey hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, the most in the world. And governments from around the world have been quick to respond to Turkey's request for international assistance. Videos shared from Turkey and across the border in Syria showed the extent of the damage. We'll keep you updated as the situation continues to unfold. Here's CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis helping us understand why earthquakes occur so frequently in Turkey and why this one was so consequential. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAREN MAGINNIS, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Now this is real time. These are some of the aftershocks. And this is an interesting trajectory, just kind of this geometry of where that energy was lying as it just kind of raced along that fault line. And this is one of the most active seismic areas in the entire world. That's because we've got a lot of tectonic plates moving around across this region, we've got a lot of rift zones, and this is illustrative of just how devastating these earthquakes can be. Now most of these earthquakes are not major earthquakes. But this one 7.8. It rivals one that occurred in northeastern Turkey in 1939. There were 16,000, 17,000 fatalities associated with that. It was at the same magnitude. This earthquake was shallow that means the effects are going to be felt much more severely than if it were much further down into the core of the earth. All right. Here are these tectonic plates I was talking about essentially these are constantly shifting. There are always earthquakes somewhere in this region being reported, but this one happened to be a major earthquake and devastating. This is devastating, one that will be in the record books. We'll remember February 2023 for this massive violent earthquake that took place in south central Turkey that has interrupted so many people's lives, but not just in Turkey, in Israel, in Jordan, in Syria where so many displaced people are currently located. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  January's U.S. jobs report surprised a lot of economists. The results showed far more jobs added than expected and the unemployment rate fell to 3.4 percent, the lowest since May of 1969. With America adding more than half a million jobs last month, we're getting more surprising clues about the overall state of the U.S. economy, and it comes as the country grapples with the impact and usefulness of new artificial intelligence platforms. Some worry that one day sooner than later a plethora of jobs could be taken away, from real humans and given to robots and computers that could presumably do the work faster, cheaper, et cetera. CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich sat down with an expert to discuss whether this threat is real or imagined. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS & POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Which jobs is AI coming after first? SHELLY PALMER, PROFESSOR OF ADVANCED MEDIA:  If you're a middle manager, you're doomed. Any kind of commodity sales person, report writers and journalists, accountants and bookkeepers and oddly enough doctors who are looking -- who specialize in things like drug interactions. YURKEVICH:  Do you mean out of a job -- PALMER:  No. YURKEVICH:  -- or you mean that part of your job? PALMER:  That one. YURKEVICH:  OK. That's the relief a lot of Americans are looking for right now. Will it take my job? PALMER:  Yes and no. It's not going to replace you. Someone who knows how to use it well is going to take your job and that's a guarantee. YURKEVICH:  By 2025, the World Economic Forum predicts that 85 million jobs will be displaced by automation and technology, but it will also create 97 million new roles. We've seen it before in the auto industry. PALMER:  While the auto worker may be displaced because they are not as good at welding or as painting as the robot, there's probably 35 people that have to be involved in the creation and maintenance of that device that welds better than a person. YURKEVICH:  And that's what happened at Carbon Robotics, former auto workers now building an AI laser weeder in Detroit for farms. The laser weeder still operated by a human but run by AI can do the work of between 40 to 50 people says the CEO, filling roles that are hard to find humans for. This music is composed solely by artificial intelligence called AIVA. It even has an album you can stream. AI music is more affordable. There's no producer, composer or artist to pay. KARL FOWLKES, ENTERTAINMENT AND BUSINESS ATTORNEY:  It's taken away opportunity from songwriters, producers and artists, right? So the people are trying to feed them for their families. YURKEVICH:  Something similar is happening in the art world. Leading artist Kara Ortiz and two others to file a class-action lawsuit against three AI art companies for copyright infringement. Ortiz claims they're using her name and art to train the AI. KARA ORTIZ, ARTIST:  It's feast and famine for most of us we go job by job, and what happens when there's a little bit less work to go around? ROBOT:  My father tried to teach me human emotions. PALMER:  There's a wonderful scene in the movie "I, Robot". Detective Spooner hates robots, he says. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can a robot write a symphony? Can a robot turn a canvas into a beautiful masterpiece? PALMER:  And the robot looks up and goes, can you? Every one of us is not Mozart or Rembrandt or Picasso or choose your super famous amazing artist or artisan. We're just people. This is not coming to kill us. It's coming to help us. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Located in midtown Manhattan, which of these sports facilities has dubbed the "World's Most Famous Arena"? Churchill Downs, Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden or Silverstone Circuit? The correct answer here is Madison Square Garden, often referred to as The Garden. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And up next, most of us have heard of facial recognition technology. The software capable of matching a human face from a digital image or video against real faces in real time, or a database of faces. While the technology is being praised as a way to heighten security and can make things like unlocking your phone quicker and easier, some view it as an invasion of privacy. What do you think? Here's CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez from inside New York City's Madison Square Garden. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You've come up on (INAUDIBLE) matching somebody on our facial recognition list. OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  He was recognized on facial recognition cameras, then confronted. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you Benjamin Noren? BENJAMIN NOREN, LAWYER:  Yes. JIMENEZ:  This is how lawyer Benjamin Noren, from one New York City law firm, was greeted by Madison Square Garden staff while trying to attend an event in the fall. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The ticket has been revoked and you are not permitted in the building. JIMENEZ:  It's because Noren works for a law firm representing ticket brokers in a lawsuit against Madison Square Garden Entertainment. All of the roughly 60 lawyers at his firm are also banned until the litigation is resolved. Some experts believe it's a slippery slope, and not just the discretionary power of who else could be flagged in the future, but one method being used to enforce it, even if it is legal. DAVE MAASS, DIRECTOR OF INVESTIGATIONS, ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION:  I have read their privacy policy. They explicitly say that the biometrics they capture from you can be used for any purpose that would -- that would benefit their economic interest. JIMENEZ:  Some don't believe it should be used at all. ALBERT FOX CAHN, FOUNDER, SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY OVERSIGHT PROJECT:  And I am terrified of the day where we allow companies to use so many forms of tracking and surveillance that, you know, we end up in the middle of one of the largest cities on the planet without any place we can actually go, while keeping our privacy. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And today's story getting a 10 out of 10, we're talking about the world's oldest dog again. Two weeks ago, we brought you Spike, a 23-year-  old Chihuahua mix from Ohio who was named the oldest living dog. But along comes Bobi and Bobi's like not so fast my man's best friend. Bobi is a Portuguese mastiff from Portugal and at 30 years old, he has now been named the world's oldest living dog by the Guinness World Records. Having lived twice his life expectancy, he's also now considered officially the oldest dog to ever live. The previous record of 29 years in five months was set back in the 1930s by an Australian cattle dog named Bluey. Bobi's age has been confirmed by the veterinary medical service and a Portuguese pet database. Thirty years ago, that was 1993 when the World Wide Web was made available to the public for the first time. So, congrats Bobi, that's a WWW to you. Also winning, Salinas South Middle School in Salina, Kansas -- shout out to you today. Thanks for coming, commenting and subscribing on our CNN 10 YouTube channel. Have a fan cactus day, y'all.

(END VIDEOTAPE) COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Just like presidents before him, many of those themes were discussed last night when U.S. President Joe Biden gave his annual State of the Union Address to Congress. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, reporting from Phoenix, Arizona, for you all week long. The U.S. Constitution does not require a president to give this speech. In fact, Article II Section 3 only says, quote, he shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient. So the fact that this speech happens every year, that it's done in person, that it's televised, and the fact that it's followed up by a response from the opposing political party -- well, those are all traditions associated with the State of the Union, not requirements by the Constitution itself. Still, the event is an opportunity for the U.S. president to tout what he sees as successes by his administration and it's an opportunity for the opposing party to lay out a different vision for the country. This was President Biden's second official State of the Union Address, but it was first given to a divided Congress. After Republicans took control of the House of Representatives following last year's midterm elections. Have a listen to some of the highlights of what the president had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Folks, the story of America is a story of progress and resilience, of always moving forward, of never ever giving up. It's a story unique among all nations. We're the only country that has emerged from every crisis we've ever entered stronger than we got into it. Look, folks, that's what we're doing again. Two years ago, the economy was reeling. I stand here tonight after we've created with the help of many people in this room 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president's created in four years because of you all, because of the American people. (APPLAUSE) Two years ago -- and two years ago, COVID had shut down -- our businesses were closed, our schools were robbed of so much, and today, COVID no longer controls our lives. And two years ago, democracy faced the greatest threat to the civil war and today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken. (APPLAUSE) As we gather here tonight, we're writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders asked me to define America and they do believe it or not, I try to define it in one word, and I mean this -- possibilities. We don't think anything is beyond our capacity, everything is a possibility. You know we're often told that Democrats and Republicans can't work together, but over the past two years, we've proved the cynics and naysayers wrong. Yes, we disagreed plenty and yes, there were times when Democrats went alone. But time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together, came together to defend us stronger and safer Europe. It came together to pass one in the -- one in a generation, once in a generation infrastructure law, building bridges connecting our nation and our people. In fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan pieces of legislation since becoming president, from reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, the Electoral Count Reform Act, the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love. And to my Republican friends, if we could work together the last Congress, there's no reason we can't work together and find consensus on important things in this Congress as well. (APPLAUSE) Well, folks, so let's look at the results. We're not finished yet by any stretch of the imagination, but the unemployment rate is at 3.4 percent, a 50-year low. A near record -- a near record unemployment, near record unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers. We've already created your help eight hundred thousand good paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years. So, I've come to fulfill my constitutional obligation to report in the State of the Union and here's my report, because the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Now, as for the tradition of the opposing political party's response to the state of the union address, it started in the 1960s and it's a speech given by Republicans when there's a Democratic president and by Democrats when there's a Republican president. Last night, the rebuttal came from Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas. Sanders became Arkansas's first female governor after she was elected in November. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS (R), ARKANSAS:  From out-of-control inflation and violent crime, to the dangerous border crisis and threat from China, Biden and the Democrats have failed you. They know it and you know it, and it's time for a change. Tonight, let us reaffirm our commitment to a timeless American idea, that government exists not to rule the people but to serve the people. Democrats want to rule us with more government control, but that's not who we are. America is the greatest country the world has ever known because we're the freest country the world has ever known, with the people who are strong and resilient. President Biden inherited the fastest economic recovery on record, the most secure border in history, cheap, abundant, homegrown energy, fast rising wages, a rebuilt military and a world that was stable and at peace. But over the last two years, Democrats destroyed it all, a new generation of Republican leaders are stepping up not to be caretakers of the status quo but to be change makers for the American people. We know not what the future holds but we know who holds the future in his hands. And with God as our witness, we will show the world that America is still the place where freedom reigns and liberty will never die. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these painters was known for his "drip technique" of splashing paint onto a surface? Salvador Dali, Jackson Pollock, Claude Monet, or Pablo Picasso? Modern American painter Jackson Pollock became famous for us look out I'm about to splatter some paint technique in the mid-1950s. In today's story getting a 10 out of 10, an accidental art installation on a highway in Australia. Take a look at this -- a cargo truck on the highway lost control and spilled more than 260 gallons of paint. That's enough paint for hundreds of canvases and aren't the results just so perfectly and perfect it turned the coastal area into a scene that would certainly catch the attention of Jackson Pollock. Hang this one in the Louvre, people. All right. I want to give a special shout out to Hyatts Middle School in Powell, Ohio, for the work of art you created in the comments section of our CNN 10 YouTube Channel and my @CoyWire social accounts. Thanks for the love and go Eagles. All right. My perfectly imperfect people out there -- remember, of the nearly 8 billion people on this planet, there is no one in the world like you.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone, it's your boy Coy coming to you from Super Bowl radio row here in Phoenix, Arizona, ahead of Sunday's big game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs. We have a great show for you today, but not a lot of time to do it, so let's get to it. Now, we do have to start with some sad news out of Turkey and Syria -- an update on the earthquake we told you about earlier this week. The death toll from the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria continues to rise, with upwards of 11,000 people dead when we recorded our show. Additionally, eight agencies and experts warned that time is running out to help rescue people stuck in the rubble who may still be alive. In addition, tens of thousands of people have been injured. The earthquake with a 7.8 magnitude struck Turkey a neighboring Syria on Monday. The quake is one of the strongest to hit the region in more than 100 years. Additionally, rescuers have faced shortages of trucks fuel and time to deliver aid to impacted areas. Thousands of buildings collapsed and aid agencies are particularly worried about northwestern Syria where more than 4 million people were already relying on humanitarian assistance. To make matters worse, freezing weather conditions are further endangering survivors and complicating rescue efforts as more than 100 aftershocks have struck the region. We'll hear now from CNN correspondent Salma Abdelaziz who is joining us from Istanbul to describe the efforts of survivors and what's happening currently in the region. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  We're at a buzzing aid distribution center here in the center of Istanbul. There are hundreds of volunteers, municipal workers, all here to try and help those in the earthquake zone. You can see them right here. They're packing food. Everything you're looking at here has been donated by individuals, by families, by businesses donations that people want to see go to that affected area. So, they're packing these boxes really with the basics. I want to show you here. We've got diapers, clothes, juice boxes for kids -- I mean, anything you can imagine, mostly, of course, non-medical aid here, just individuals and businesses doing what they can. Of course, Turkey is receiving help from dozens of countries. I think over 70 countries have pledged help to Turkey, but there is a sense that Turks want to help each other, real community spirit here. Volunteers tell us they've been able already to send dozens of trucks, tons of aid and it just keeps coming. An absolutely humongous catastrophe, the scope and scale of it almost incomprehensible, and so, there can never be enough of this help. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these U.S. government agencies forecast weather and monitors ocean conditions? FAA, NASA, NOAA, or DOJ? These duties fall under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration known as NOAA. Now, part of the mission of NOAA is to better understand storms and the potential impact they may have when they make landfall. And one way NOAA pilots collect data is by flying over hurricanes and sometimes directly into them with special equipped aircraft through their Hurricane Hunter Program. Fasten your seat belts y'all, this could get bumpy. Time to learn some more as we go navigate some unfriendly skies above the storm. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LT. CMDR. DANIELLE VARWIG, PILOT/NOAA CORPS:  Flying over a hurricane, it's otherworldly. It gives me a little bit of euphoria. Pilots are taught to not fly near these things and here I am flying at 45,000 feet above it all for the sake of national safety. REPORTER:  Former U.S. Air Force pilot, Lieutenant Commander Danielle Varwig, is a hurricane hunter pilot for NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. VARWIG:  Of course, I get nervous before every flight. REPORTER:  NOAA pilots like Varwig fly over and into storms and hurricanes across the western Atlantic, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico, collecting weather data to help forecast where and when these events will make landfall. VARWIG:  Most of the time, we're in the clouds and now we're trusting our instruments and trusting our flight directors on board with us to navigate around it. REPORTER:  Flight director Nikki Hathaway is often by her side, using radar data to help the pilots navigate through the storm. NIKKI HATHAWAY, NOOA FLIGHT DIRECTOR:  Yeah, it's a bumpy ride. I would say if you are not a fan of roller coasters, it's probably not the job for you. Essentially on this aircraft, it's a flying science lab. The data that we're collecting on board essentially goes back down to the National Hurricane Center and a variety of other researchers and this data is being used real time to make life-saving decisions impacting the people on the ground potentially in harm's way. REPORTER:  That data helps protect millions of people across North and Central America and the Caribbean. HATHAWAY:  You're always thinking about those people in harm's way, and when it is your people, you know, when it's impacting your home, there's that extra element of just like stress in the back of your head, but it's really important to compartmentalize those feelings to get the job done. REPORTER:  Neither Varwig nor Hathaway flew this season, but over the past couple of years, they've been deployed for days, weeks, sometimes months at a time. VARWIG:  It is hard to be away from my kids. The one thing that pushes me through dealing with the separation from my family is the fact that I am serving my country. REPORTER:  That mission to serve to keep others safe come hail or shine is what sets these women apart. VARWIG:  I want to put myself out there if anything to be a role model to little girls, little black girls. I want to make sure that others can look to me and say, okay, well, she's doing it, then I can, too. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. Sports history was made Tuesday night when Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James became the NBA's all-time leading scorer, breaking the record of 38,387 points set more than 38 years ago by another Lakers legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. LeBron entered the league out of high school in 2003 as an 18-year-old from Akron, Ohio. And now at 38, he's still going strong. He's been a driving force for creating change from speaking up on social justice issues to creating the I Promise School in his home state. LeBron is also known for his actions off the court. Our CNN 10 special guest Omar Jimenez is in Los Angeles covering this historic moment. (BEGIN VIDSEOTAPE) OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  People came to see history and they witnessed it. LeBron James now the all-time leading scorer in NBA history, and he would be the first to admit that he didn't think he would be the one to break what some thought was a previously unbreakable record. But when you look at everything LeBron has done over the course of his career, who else would it have been? And the moment came on a Tuesday night. And when that happened, when he hit a fade away off the left elbow, almost nothing but net, he ran to center court, raised his arms in triumph as an entire arena cheered him on, likely many more watching from home. He came to the center court and was greeted by his family as a crowd chanted MVP, he was emotional as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the person whose record he now eclipsed, embraced him and greeted him along with the NBA commissioner. And when you look at LeBron James's legacy, the on the court, of course, will be respected and always remembered. But the reaction and the embraces that he had once he crossed that milestone or emblematic of who he is off the court. And for many, all of those come together in the legacy that is LeBron James. And when you talk about the historic milestone that was crossed, it wasn't just a moment in NBA history. For those watching and that have followed him all around the world, this was a moment in history. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  In today's story getting a 10 out of 10, it's absolutely nuts. Lots of them. A pest control expert in California found more than 700 pounds of acorns from behind a wall in a home in Glen Ellen, California. Now that's a cornucopia. You're probably thinking dang squirrels, why'd you go nuts in that person's wall like that? Turns out, woodpeckers were the culprits. Typically, this type of bird would peck away and drop thousands of acorns through a hole and store them inside dying tree stumps but not these woodpeckers. Look out, because they could be coming to your neighborhood next. All right. Shout out time now. We're going to Oceanside Middle School in Thomaston, Maine. We see you. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. Did you know that today, February 9th is National Pizza Day. Whether it's New York style thin crust, Chicago style deep dish, or anything in between, pizza is an American dream, and you all have a pizza our heart. I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10. END230210

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, lovely people? The weekend is just around the corner. Friday's rock. We are fueled up, ready to share the best 10 minutes in the news with you. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. Let's finish this week strong. We're going to start today with an update from a story earlier this week, the Chinese spy balloon. The past few days, a new timeline of what happened has come into focus, and it turns out, a day before the suspected Chinese spy balloon entered U.S. airspace over Alaska, the Defense Intelligence Agency sent an internal report that a foreign object was headed towards U.S. territory, but the report was not flagged as urgent in top defense officials weren't immediately alarmed. But when the balloon entered Alaskan airspace and then turned south, officials began to think the balloon might have been sent as part of a spy mission. And when the balloon hovered over areas in the United States that are deemed to places of top security, including sensitive military facilities the real mission of the balloon came into focus. The Biden administration says the timeline of events helps explain why U.S. defense officials didn't act immediately, even before the balloon had crossed over into U.S. territory. But some Republicans have criticized the government for not acting sooner and not seeing the balloon as an urgent threat. They argued that they should have shot the balloon down before it even crossed into the continental U.S. But other officials within the administration have argued that the benefits of gathering additional intelligence on the balloon outweigh shooting it down immediately. We'll keep you posted and updated as the situation unfolds. We'll hear now from Selina Wang, a CNN correspondent based in Beijing, with more analysis. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Beijing is hitting back at Washington's statements about the suspected spy balloon. The Pentagon said on Tuesday that China refused a conversation with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin following the downing of the balloon. Well, now, China's defense ministry is saying they rejected that call because the conditions were not right, given the U.S.'s, quote, irresponsible and seriously wrong approach. We've seen Beijing's rhetoric hardened significantly after the U.S. military shot down the balloon, after initially expressing regret for what they claim is a weather balloon that flew off course. Beijing is now accusing the U.S. of overreacting and violating international practice. The contrast between what Beijing and Washington are claiming is only getting starker. You have China on one hand doubling down on its claim this was a civilian balloon that took an unplanned course that was out of their control. On the other hand, the Pentagon has said it has 100 percent certainty that the downed Chinese balloon was not being used for civilian purposes. CNN has reported that U.S. intelligence officials believe the balloon is part of an extensive military run surveillance program that involves a fleet of balloons spanning five continents. China's ministry of foreign affairs said that claim is, quote, likely part of the U.S.'s information and public opinion warfare and accuse the U.S. of being the world's largest surveillance reconnaissance country. The Pentagon has said that maintaining open lines of communication with China are particularly important in moments like this. The question still remains as to whether this balloon incident will lead to long-term damage to the relationship between the U.S. and China that is already extremely tense. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  A 7.8 magnitude earthquake shook Turkey and Syria in the early hours of Monday morning. It was so powerful that it was felt as far as Cyprus, Lebanon and Israel. But this region is no stranger to earthquakes so why was this one so devastating. This is one of the strongest earthquakes to hit Turkey in about a century and it was followed by dozens of aftershocks, some almost as powerful as the initial quake. And then there's the question of how shallow this earthquake was at the epicenter, just 18 kilometers deep, causing severe shaking on the ground. This is an earthquake more powerful than the one that hit Haiti in 2010, causing utter devastation. And this region is located on a major fault line. In the disaster zone, thousands of homes have collapsed. Now many of Turkey's apartment blocks are built to modern design standards but still about 20 percent of its urban environment is not. And then when you take a look at Northwest Syria, well, that country has been battle scarred. There, many of the structures were extremely susceptible to collapse. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: The Roman numeral LVII represents which of these numbers? 107, 52, 57, or 102? The answer is 57 and Super Bowl LVII kicks off this Sunday, marking the 57th edition of the big game. It's estimated that two-thirds of the U.S. population watched last year's Super Bowl. That's more than 200 million people, and that's why a 30-second commercial during this year's game cost $7 million. So, yeah, all eyes will be on Glendale, Arizona, this Sunday, when the Kansas City Chiefs face off against the Philadelphia Eagles. Some watch the game for the commercials. Others watch for the halftime show, which this year will be headlined by none other than Rihanna. But no matter how you look at it, the Super Bowl is big business. In fact, the Arizona Chamber of Commerce said last Super Bowl they hosted here in 2015 generated about $720 million for the city, but they're expecting close to one billion dollars for this one. And for the first time, the area is expecting more than a million visitors to the city at the same time, with so much action happening in one place, keeping the event fun and safe is a major concern for security experts. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  What are U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter - UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're flying about 500 feet. FLORES:  A U.S. Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All clear. FLORES:  And an F-16 fighter jet doing over Glendale, Arizona? They're tasked with guarding the skies over Super Bowl LVII. With nearly 200,000 fans expected for the big game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles, security is a multiagency effort. From this operations center, the FBI, alongside more than 40 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies will use these 360-degree cameras to have eyes on every inch of the stadium. Sky patrol is in the hands of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Air and Marine Operations. When your teams are patrolling, what could they be looking for? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're going to look for anything out of the ordinary. It could be anything from smoke to disruptions. FLORES:  CBP Air and Marine Operations will be able to fly over the stadium during the big game, but no other aircraft will because the FAA will be imposing a flight restriction that's 30 miles wide. Those flight restrictions will be enforced by NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, with these Air Force F-16 fighter jets. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Since 9/11, we've been able to safely escort out any aircraft that's violated restricted airspace. FLORES:  NORAD is taking no chances. This KC-135 Stratotanker is part of the fleet on hand. This aircraft can carry up to 200,000 pounds of fuel. There are 10 tanks on board including some on the wings. And it can refuel an F-16 midair in minutes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It prevents us from having a return for fuel on the ground. So it's absolutely critical. FLORES:  The fighter jets refuel from a receptacle that's right behind the pilot. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And my job as the pilot is just to remain within the basket in a safe controlled stable position. If the FAA's flight restrictions are broken, NORAD or CBP air and marine operations will engage. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Sunday's game is considered one of the most evenly matched Super Bowls ever and experts are divided on who they think is going to win. But for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, what does the animal kingdom have to say? Apparently, a lot. In Iowa, a baby giraffe at the Blank Park Zoo stuck its neck out and chose the leafy snack that represented a Chiefs win. In Maryland, a bear at the Salisbury zoo disagreed and went for the box with Eagles logo on it. Kansas, this orangutan said she's sticking with her hometown heroes, the Chiefs. But what about a groundhog? This one at the Turtle Back Zoo in New Jersey said, forget wintertime, she's got the Eagles as champ. Let's keep in touch this weekend. I'm @coywire on Insta, Snapchat and TikTok. We want to give a special shout out to Marrington middle school of the Arts in Goose Creek, South Carolina, we see you.

WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, lovely people? Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, where we put together the best minutes in news for you. So let's maximize these moments, get a little smarter and wiser and have a little fun while doing it. We start today's episode by talking about the air up there.  Is it just me or does it feel like America just can't escape these mysterious threats we've been seeing from the sky? It started a week ago with the incident involving a suspected Chinese spy balloon which was shot down off the South Carolina coast on February 4th, and the deepening national security mystery keeps evolving with U.S. fighter jets blasting three unidentified objects out of the skies three days in a row now.  The latest incident was a high altitude object shot down on Sunday by an F- 16 over Lake Huron which lies between Michigan and Ontario. On Saturday, a missile took down an object flying at 40,000 feet over Central Yukon, way up in northwestern Canada.  And that's just some of the aerial action that's happened in the last few days. No one within the Pentagon, the White House or the government of Canada seems to be able to say what exactly in the world is going on.  We'll hear from CNN White House reporter Natasha Bertrand who's been following this story and in the coming weeks as this story continues to unfold, you know we'll keep you up to date right here on CNN 10.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER (voice-over):  The U.S. on edge, dispatching fighter jets to shoot down yet another mysterious object near Michigan's Lake Huron on Sunday. The incident is the third time in as many days that the U.S. military has shot down an unidentified object that was assessed to pose a risk to civilian aircraft and unprecedented series of events. GEN. GLEN VANHERCK, COMMANDER OF NORAD AND USNORTHCOM:  I believe this is the first time within the United States of America airspace that NORAD or United States northern command has taken kinetic action against an airborne object. BERTRAND:  On Friday and Saturday, U.S. jets shot down two more objects near Alaska and over northern Canada. Those objects were flying at around forty thousand feet and had balloon-like features with a small metal cylinder underneath officials said. Sunday's object over Lake Huron was flying at around twenty thousand feet and it was described by officials as octagonal with potential surveillance capabilities. The incidents have sparked confusion and prompted bipartisan criticism from lawmakers. REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT), RANKING, INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I have real concerns about why the administration is not being more forthcoming with everything that it knows. But part of the problem here is that the both of the second and the third objects were shot down in very remote areas. So, my guess is that that there's just not a lot of information out there yet to share. BERTRAND:  After a Chinese spy balloon transited the U.S. earlier this month and was also shot down, the North American aerospace defense command readjusted its filters to better spot slow-moving targets operating above a certain altitude officials said, which may be leading to more detections.  But officials say they won't know more about the objects until they can recover and analyze all of the debris. The incidents have also raised questions about whether similar objects have simply gone undetected in the past and whether shooting each one down is the right response. REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH):  What's been come clear in the public discussion is that we don't really have adequate radar systems. We certainly don't have an integrated missile defense system. We're going to have to begin to look at the United States airspace as one that we need to defend and that we need to have appropriate sensors to do so. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Of the original 13 colonies, which was the last to be established? Georgia, Rhode Island, North Carolina or Virginia? Founded in 1732, Georgia was created as a buffer between South Carolina and the Spanish in Florida. Up next, we're headed to the barrier islands off southeastern Georgia. The region is home to miles of undeveloped beaches, seaside forests, salt marshes and a proposed spaceport hoping to launch rockets directly over the national seashore. This has been quite the controversial topic as you can imagine for nearby communities.  The residents, they don't want their serene and undisturbed lands to be altered. Let's go on the ground to this beautiful region for more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIM RENNER, RESIDENT:  Directly across the river right there in those trees, that's the spaceport site and actually the proposed launch pad site. It's crazy to propose to launch rockets over Cumberland Island national seashore.  REPORTER:  This is Cumberland Island and Little Cumberland Island. They're two barrier islands that form part of a wildlife sanctuary off the southeastern coast of Georgia, but a proposed spaceport is hoping to send rockets directly over the national seashore, altering the horizon and stirring controversy in the secluded community. The proposed rocket would also travel over private homes on Little Cumberland Island. This is something that's unprecedented. SUE HUFF, RESIDENT:  My house is five miles downrange from the launch pad. My understanding is I'm directly in the middle of the cone. The fear of rockets going over my head is the failure rate. And with a high failure rate, the concern is debris falling on my property on me. REPORTER:  Small class rockets like the one Spaceport Camden hopes to launch can have up to a 20 percent failure rate. Several of these small class rockets have experienced issues in recent years, showing what can happen when these types of rockets fail.  The odds of a direct impact crash are extremely low, but many residents feel there is no acceptable amount of risk when humans are in the rocket's path. RENNER:  This is part of the Cumberland Island national seashore, and the idea that Camden County thinks they can safely launch rockets over an area like this where there's no opportunity to monitor whether people are here or not, there's no opportunity to bring firefighting equipment on here and to fight a fire in maritime forests like this, it's just ridiculous. So this is a firebox, one of several that we have stationed along the trails around Little Cumberland Island.  This is our fire station. We've got slappers for putting out if there's a, you know, flames in a ground fire, rakes and they've got a hand operated pump. So take that exploding rocket. STEVE HOWARD, FORMER SPACEPORT CAMDEN PROJECT LEAD:  There's all kinds of you know risks that you have to look at and you have to evaluate it, all those things will be looked at when a company comes forward. You have to prepare for all those things, but they're very remote that that would happen the likelihood of somebody getting hurt worse. Numbers I looked at range from between and million to one in a billion with a B. This is more than just launching rockets. It's about all the opportunities to inspire the next generation. Spaceport Camden will become the Silicon marsh of the East Coast. REPORTER:  In addition to the safety concerns, skeptics point out that the outcome of space will come in is by no means guaranteed and therefore not worth the hefty price tag. Camden County has spent more than $12 million dollars on the project over the last decade. That's taxpayer money some residents say they wish could be spent elsewhere.  The FAA has licensed 14 spaceports across the United States but Spaceport Camden would be the first private spaceport to launch rockets vertically over U.S. citizens a few miles away.  And then there's the potential ecological risks within national park in the proposed trajectory. HOWARD:  What you do in a launch side application process is really a represented rocket. We hope some of those companies at some point will actually come here, you know, in the future. But at this point, it'd be representative. It was never about the rockets that becomes a catalyst economic driver, but you want all this innovation, you want all this high- tech opportunity. You want to drive that innovation and lift up the whole coast of Georgia. REPORTER:  After a series of delays, the county secured a spaceport operator license from the FAA in late 2021. But Camden County residents petitioned for a special election where they overwhelmingly voted to block the county from purchasing the land for the spaceport. In February 2023, Georgia's Supreme Court unanimously rejected an appeal by Camden County officials, preventing the coastal community from moving forward with the spaceport.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Wonderful Wednesday to you. It's your boy Coy. Grateful to be spending part of our day right here with you on CNN 10. You know, sometimes when tragedy strikes, it can serve as a reminder that we should never take any of the moments we're given for granted. We're starting with an update on the earthquake that has shattered families in Turkey and Syria. The 7.8 magnitude quake had taken the lives of more than 36,000 people as of the time of this show's recording. Tens of thousands more are injured. The latest report from Turkey's health ministry said more than 19,000 people were hospitalized with injuries sustained from the disaster in more than one thousand children in Turkey were separated from their parents. More than a week now after the earthquake struck and rescuers are still working around the clock in hopes of saving lives. Seven more people were rescued from the rubble yesterday but hopes of finding further survivors dwindle with every second that passes. The reality is that survival stories are becoming few and far between as rescue operations start to shift recovery efforts. And for many in Syria, the earthquake is just the latest in a decade-long series of tragedies. In recent years, the country has been torn apart and 1.7 million people are living in tents in refugee camps. CNN's Nada Bashir is in Istanbul where a massive effort to send aid is currently underway. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, a week on since Turkey was struck by devastating earthquake on Monday, and aid centers like this one here are still being filled with volunteers, with donations to be distributed to those impacted by the earthquake. And as you can see here, boxes and boxes are being filled up with life-saving humanitarian assistance, and crucial donations for those impacted by the earth (INAUDIBLE), clothes, blankets, to toiletries, anything that someone who has been made homeless, displaced by the devastation could need in order to survive over the next few weeks. And there are aid centers like this one you can see the sheer scale of this hangar where the aid donations are coming in. There are centers like this across the country because of course as we are still seeing the death tolls rising and we are still seeing miraculously survivors being pulled out of the rubble. This is now becoming more of a recovery effort than a rescue effort and there are of course thousands and thousands of people, of families, extremely vulnerable now, desperately in need, hugely dependent on that humanitarian assistance between aid groups from across the globe, traveling into Turkey to support in that effort. And here in Istanbul, it's not just the international aid that's coming in, and there's Turks, it's people from this country piling into centers like this one to provide those donations. There is a real sense of unity here, people really want to help and of course there are so many in need. The question of what's also now relating to northwest Syria, getting aid across the border there, through the Bab al-Hawa crossing, there has been some logistical challenges as well as diplomatic challenges in getting the aid across the northwest Syria. That now seems to be coming through. And, of course, we are also now beginning to see evacuations. People and families being evacuated from the impacted southeast region of Turkey to even here in Istanbul where they will be sheltered over the next few weeks, many of them of course now displaced homeless with nowhere else to go. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: "Girl With a Pearl Earring" is a famous painting by what artist? Johannes Vermeer, Leonardo da Vinci, Vincent van Gogh or Michelangelo? Often compared to the "Mona Lisa", Johannesburg Vermeer painted "Girl With a Pearl Earring" in around 1665. That painting is now part of an unprecedented show at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The museum is putting on the largest showcase of Vermeer paintings in our lifetime. Twenty-eight of the artist's 37 attributed works are on display, even Vermeer himself did not see that many of his paintings together all at one time. Tickets for the event are sold out, but lucky us, CNN's Nick Glass is taking us inside the exhibit to check it out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK GLASS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For a glorious 90 minutes, we had the place to ourselves. Vermeer's paintings, their beauty, their size demand intimacy and quiet. And here was an opportunity to spend quality time with his most famous creation. This is rare. I've been an arts score (ph), it's -- one for something like 20 years, and to be alone with a painting like this "Girl With a Pearl Erring", it's extraordinary and she's not alone. The Rijksmuseum has pulled off an astonishing artistic coup, the greatest Vermeer show of this or any other lifetime, 28 of the 34 to 37 attributed works. Vermeer himself would never have seen so many of his paintings altogether in one place. TACO DIBBITS, DIRECTOR, RIJKSMUSEUM:  It's very exciting. I've -- it kind of had this dream of having all the paintings together. Obviously, they're only about 37 paintings by Vermeer but having 28 here is just something we would have never saw possible. GLASS:  "The Lacemaker" from the Louvre in Paris, "Girl With the Red Hat" from the National Gallery in Washington, "Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window" from the Gemaldegalerie in Dresden, Germany. GREGOR WEBER, CO-CURATOR, RIJKSMUSEUM:  Remember that I saw for the first time two paintings by Vermeer from the National Gallery London, and I think I fainted a little bit with such a glowing light in the paintings. And since then, I feel busy with Vermeer. GLASS:  Vermeer has been under intense scrutiny in another way in the lab under infrared and other light. They've adapted specialist techniques first used by NASA to map minerals on Mars and the moon. It amounts to non- invasive fine art archeology. IGE VERSLYPE, PAINTINGS CONSERVATOR, RIKSMUSEUM:  It's as if you're looking over his shoulder and seeing what he's doing. GLASS:  We didn't know it, but Vermeer never stopped experimenting. ANNA KREKELER, PAINTINGS CONSERVATOR, RIJKSMUSEUM:  If you see the underlying paint layers for example, the underpaint, he really put on kind of fast and rough brush strokes to define light and shadow. For example, in the tablecloth, you have areas where he -- where there's black underpaint like here and here, right the darkest shadows, and then on top where the light hits the table, he used a wide underpaint. GLASS:  And behind her on the wall -- KREKELER:  Here was a fire basket, a large element to dry your clothes, and then here was a -- was a jock rack with ducks hanging on it. GLASS:  We've known for a long time that Vermeer was a genius with paints and a brush, but only now are we beginning to understand how precisely he did it. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Well, the Super Bowl is behind us, and I got to meet some pretty cool people in Arizona, like Miss Levrenz (ph). Shout outs to Cocopah Middle School. I also got to see Super Bowl traditions. Today's story getting a 10 out of 10, the Puppy Bowl. Year 19 of the clash of canines took place on Sunday, featuring team Ruff versus team Fluff. A hundred and twenty-two pumped up pups from rescues and shelters across the country, this year's game was intense. Penalty flags thrown for unnecessary roughness and for excessive cuteness. For the first time ever, the Puppy Bowl went into overtime this year and it was team Fluff wagging their way to the win 87-83. Today is hashtag your word Wednesday.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. It's Thursday. So happy Friday Eve. It's your boy Coy, aka Mr. Clean. Let's aim to be a little better today than we were yesterday and we can start by fueling our minds right here on CNN 10. First up, the inflation situation. Headline is: inflation surged in January, and by the most we'd seen in three months. As a reminder, inflation is a rise in prices and decline in the ability to purchase. It's like if someone gives you twenty dollars, you go to the movies. But the cost of a movie ticket is now $17 and last year, it was only $15 for a movie at your local theater. Rising inflation means that your twenty dollars just won't get you as much as it used to. But despite the fact that inflation costs grew this month, they've continued to slow for the year overall. But economists are bracing for uncertainty and it seems like no one not even the experts have any clue what's going to happen next. And part of this is because so many factors contribute to what makes up inflation. All economists know is that inflation has changed household budgets and altered American spending habits, especially in terms of discretionary spending. That means extra money to spend on entertainment, eating out and travel. We'll hear now from CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich who has more on what's happening in the market. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  It's been a bumpy road to cool inflation and a longer road than many Americans would like to see. But some good news, year-over-year inflation cooled to 6.4 percent falling for seven straight months. But inflation in January rose 0.5 percent and inflation and the economy have been key issues for President Biden. And coming off this report, he said that it is good news but there is still work to do as inflation remains too high. So the biggest inflation drivers were energy costs, which includes gas, up 1.5 percent from a year ago, shelter which contributed to nearly half the increase last month, that rose 7.9 percent year over year. And food costs remaining extremely high, up 10.1 percent year over year. Some key items at the grocery store costing more eggs up 70 percent, butter up 26.3 percent, and lettuce up 17.2 percent year over year. But you'll see some savings on a couple items at the grocery store -- beef, veal and bacon, all down year over year. So how does this translate to Americans budgets? Well, according to Moody's Analytics, families are spending nearly four hundred dollars more a month this year than they did last year on the same goods and services because of inflation. So this signals that there is still work for the Federal Reserve to do. We can expect continued interest rate hikes to try to bring down inflation in the months to come. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUBTITLE:  A deadly 7.8 magnitude earthquake created this chasm in the middle of a Turkish olive grove. The chasm is 130 feet (40 meters) deep and more than 900 feet (274 meters) long. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  This earthquake was beyond belief. Of course, you might get some mild tremors or an average earthquake. But we've never seen anything so explosive, or tremors of these proportions. SUBTITLE:  One in every two buildings in this region have either collapsed, are damaged or need demolition. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these words comes from a Latin term meaning "to send out"? Edify, embody, emit or encompass? Meaning to throw or give off, emit is your answer here. It's derived from the Latin word emittere. Up next, we're going to meet a climate scientist who's been researching and tracking dust for decades. That's right, dust. She tells us that those tiny particulates can essentially create change of Brobdingnag in proportions across the globe. The company SpaceX just launched with EMIT on board, a special instrument from NASA that'll help scientists learn more about how dust is affecting our atmosphere. CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar shows us how we're going to learn more about dust from space. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice-over):  In July 2022, this SpaceX rocket launched with a new NASA instrument called EMIT on board. NATALIE MAHOWALD, PROFESSOR OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE/CORNELL UNIVERSITY:  Well, EMIT is going to revolutionize what we can do. So it's just going to provide such amazing new data to help us understand the surface and the atmosphere. CHINCHAR:  Now, over 250 miles above the Earth, attached to the International Space Station, its purpose is to shed light on an important weather phenomenon -- dust. MAHOWALD:  Desert dust or mineral aerosols is a mineral soil particle that's suspended in the atmosphere. And so, these come out mostly from desert regions that are dry and unvegetated with strong winds. CHINCHAR:  For over two decades, climate scientist Natalie Mahowald has been tracking dust across the globe and how it impacts climate change. MAHOWALD:  I love looking at a globe and thinking about how dust is getting from one place to another. CHINCHAR:  She's been working with NASA on this new instrument to find out how different colors of dust in the atmosphere can heat or cool the planet. MAHOWALD:  So different soils actually have really different colors. So the white ones reflect incoming solar radiation and the red ones and the dark ones absorb it. So one of the problems we have in understanding the impact of desert dust is we don't know the composition very well. CHINCHAR:  Using a device called an imaging spectrometer, EMIT scans the Earth's arid regions to detect different colored soils, creating a mineral map. MAHOWALD:  Already, EMIT has taken millions or billions of observations of what's going on in the arid regions in terms of the composition. And then we can use that to put into our models, to better understand what actually the impact of the desert dust is. CHINCHAR:  Dust and sandstorms have dramatically increased in recent years due to climate change, land degradation, and drought, according to the U.N. These storms are causing respiratory illnesses, damaging livestock, disrupting transport and even melting arctic ice. MAHOWALD:  We've also watched dust plumes really just travel across oceans and be deposited in Greenland or even in the Alps. CHINCHAR:  EMIT can also detect another factor impacting climate change -- methane, a potent greenhouse gas. It's detected 50 super emitters across the world, mostly coming from fossil fuel, landfill and agricultural facilities. NASA hopes this knowledge can help countries stem the emissions and shine a spotlight on how our planet is changing. MAHOWALD:  So you can think of the EMIT project as really testing the waters and really showing what is possible. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, the ghost yacht. A 53- foot ship sat eerily abandoned in a marina at Kent Narrows, Maryland, for decades. It was nicknamed the "Ghost Yacht". But now, the mysterious yacht is being reimagined. The state's artificial reef program sunk the vessel to the bottom of the Chesapeake Bay this past week as one of Maryland's artificial reefs. The hope is that it'll become a habitat for all sorts of fish and underwater creatures and provide an underwater treasure for scuba divers. Kind of like a sunken pirate ship. All right. Dad joke alert, what did the pirate say when he turned 80? I'm 80. I want to give a special salute to all of you lovely people who made a #YourWordWednesday submission. Thanks to the likes of @laurensandrasrq. Today's word was Brobdingnagian if you didn't notice, which means gigantic. And we want to give a Brobdingnagian shout out to Woodbridge Middle School in Bridgeville, Delaware, rise up. Have an awesome day, lovely people, or maybe an all a lot day.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. You made it. The weekend is upon us. Friday is here and Friday's rock, especially this Friday because we're headed into a three-day weekend. We have a lot of news to get through today, so not a lot of time to do it. Let's get to it. We're going to begin with the latest out of New Zealand where the country just declared a national state of emergency. Cyclone Gabrielle hit New Zealand with wind and rain, knocking out power to tens of thousands of homes in the area. The wind gusts were greater than 87 miles per hour, waves were close to 36 feet high. When we recorded this show the storm had killed at least five people and caused widespread damage. Police in the area say they remain focused on locating those people that are unaccounted for. What exactly is a cyclone? Let's break it down. Cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons are essentially the same, with only the location of the storm determining what we call it. For example, the only difference between a hurricane and a typhoon is that typhoons happen in the Western and North Pacific waters, while hurricanes occur in the Eastern and North Pacific and the North Atlantic Basin. That's why whenever we talk about these types of storms in the U.S., it's almost always a hurricane. Cyclones happen only in the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific. We'll keep you updated as news unfold surrounding the cyclone in New Zealand as the worst of the weather looks to have passed significant and potentially life-threatening challenges remain. Next story today, earlier this month, a Norfolk Southern train which was carrying toxic chemicals at the time derailed from the tracks and crashed in eastern Ohio. Now, the derailment ignited the hazardous chemicals on board, covering the town of East Palestine with smoke. Authorities created an evacuation zone around the crash and fearing a major explosion performed a controlled release of the chemicals. Weeks later, residents have been encouraged to return home, but there are lots of questions about just how harmful exposure to these chemicals could be. The plumes of smoke from the explosion carry the hazardous material into the air and water to which residents would be exposed. With all eyes on Ohio, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator otherwise known as EPA, Michael Regan, visited the region on Thursday to assess the ongoing response and hear from impacted residents. Here's CNN's national correspondent Jason Carroll who's been on the ground in Ohio for the last few days covering this story for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. BRUCE VANDERHOOF, DIRECTOR, OHIO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH:  We are strongly recommending those who have not yet had their water source checked to use bottled water. And bottled water is being made available. JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  More than a week after a toxic train derailment that led to the evacuation of much of this small Ohio town, state health officials are urging some East Palestine residents to drink bottled water until water tests are complete. Officials say the toxic spill was largely contained the day after the derailment and that tests have shown the air quality is safe. But they have found low levels of contaminants in four nearby waterways spanning seven and a half miles, including Leslie Run, a creek which runs through East Palestine and neighboring Negli (ph), right through the back of Kathy Reese's (ph) property. (on camera):  In the back of your property back here, they found dead fish? KATHY REESE (ph), EAST PALESTINE RESIDENT:  Yes, they saw dead fish. CARROLL:  Reese says she has been drinking bottled water instead of well water ever since she started spotting dead fish in the creek following the derailment. She says she's still waiting for the state to come and test her well water. REESE:  Air wise, I feel OK. Water wise, no. No. There's just too many chemicals and stuff that were spilled that they still don't want to identify completely. CARROLL:  An Ohio Department of Natural Resources official estimates some 3,500 fish in the state have died following the train derailment. These people saw the flames from their homes and worried their neighborhood still may not be safe. What about testing water or ground? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nothing yet. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And I get that I don't recommend you put anything in the ground. I mean, vegetables or tomatoes or anything this year because we don't know. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't think they're going to do enough. CARROLL:  And some residents say they have been frustrated by what they describe as a lack of communication with officials on the ground. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We pass all of the creeks and there's crew after crew with white hoses and black hoses all through the creeks, they're not telling us why, and this is daily. I'm driving my children to school past all of this and they're asking me questions that I don't have answers to. CARROLL:  Some of their questions unanswered. We found getting information just as challenging. OK, just tell me, are they pumping water out or pumping water back in? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You can talk to the guys up in top of the hill, sir. We're just grunts. CARROLL:  We're just trying to get a sense of what those pumps are. Can just -- someone just -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Norfolk Southern can tell you everything. That's the hotline. They can tell you everything. CARROLL:  But you realize people are calling this number and no one is getting back to them. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're just told to direct people to that number. CARROLL:  The governor asked by reporters Tuesday if he would feel comfortable living in East Palestine. GOV. MIKE DEWINE (R), OHIO:  I think that I would be drinking the bottled water. And I would be continuing to find out what the tests were showing as far as the air. I would be alert and concerned, but I think I would probably be back in my house. CARROLL:  But residents like Kathy Reese say they are left with few choices. REESE:  Just, I guess, pray and keep drink a bottled water until we know for sure what's going on. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these is the most visited urban park in the U.S.? Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, D.C.'s National Mall, Central Park in New York or the Lincoln Park in Chicago. With 40 million annual visitors, Central Park is the most visited city park in the U.S. The park is also home to a wide range of wildlife as you can imagine but a newcomer is getting most of the attention right now. Flaco, the owl, escaped from the Central Park Zoo and is at large and on the loose in the park. The rare Eurasian eagle owl escaped his enclosure on February 2nd, and since then, zoo officials have kept an eye on the bird which has become a bit of a celebrity. While Flaco seems to be adapting well to the wild, there are some concerns over how he might adapt to that New York City lifestyle. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  There's a new star in Central Park and he's right out of central casting. Lately, bird watchers only have eyes for owls. And some fans on David Barrett's burger blog are saying. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let Flaco be free. MOOS:  In the beginning of February Flaco escaped from his exhibit at the Central Park Zoo after someone cut through the stainless steel mesh. His enclosure didn't have room to do much flying. In his first night of freedom, the NYPD almost corralled him on a Fifth Avenue sidewalk. "Well, that was a hoot," the NYPD tweeted when the owl flew off. EDMUND BERRY, BIRDER EYEWITNESS:  I was worried that it wouldn't be able to fly but it spread its wings and flew to the nearest set of trees. MOOS:  Zoo officials were most worried that Flaco didn't know how to hunt since he's always had his meals delivered. They tried to learn them using a white wrapped in a cage hoping he gets trapped in the wiry filaments on top. DAVID BARRETT, MANHATTAN BIRD ALERT:  The zoo team was rushing with nets to get Flaco but Flaco was too fast. MOOS:  And now fans are snapping photos of Flaco catching his own dinner. BARRETT:  Rats. MOOS:  Rats on the menu. Barrett says the owl's gone from zero hunting skills to decent hunting skills. BARRETT:  That's just an incredible transformation. MOOS:  He hangs out in Central Park charming New Yorkers with hooting so low it requires subtitles. Like other creatures not native to Central Park, Flaco the Eurasian Eagle Owl has become one of the select few. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. I know you are all ready to flee for the weekend like Flaco. Monday is President's Day. So no show that day. Originally established in 1885 in recognition of President George Washington, the U.S. holiday now recognizes all presidents past and present. Fairmont, West Virginia, you're getting the shout out today. East Fairmont Middle School -- rise up, Hornets. Have a wonderful weekend, everyone, and remember you are more powerful than you know. It's been a blessing to spend this week with you. END230220

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you.  It's your boy Coy. I hope you had a wonderful weekend and a pleasant President's Day holiday. I am pumped to be back here with you to start this week off strong.  We're going to begin with the latest news out of Ukraine. This week, President Biden made an unexpected visit to Kyiv. It was his first visit since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost a year ago. Here's part of what the president had to say about this trip: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  That dark night one year ago, the world was literally at the time bracing for the fall of Kyiv. One year later, Kyiv stands, and Ukraine stands, democracy stands. The Americans stand with you and the world stands with you. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Now, there is a long history of American presidents visiting war zones. This trip was unprecedented in modern history however because the American president traveled to an active war zone without a large U.S. military presence. President Biden said his trip was to reaffirm the, quote, unwavering support that the United States holds for Ukraine. But, earlier this month, the United States said Russia has committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine. That was an escalation of what they'd said previously. Russia called the accusation an excuse for Washington to further the conflict. During his trip, President Biden also announced new military assistance for Ukraine and incoming sanctions against Moscow. We'll keep you informed on any more updates from the president's trip as well as new information on the ongoing war overseas. And over the weekend, the secretive nation of North Korea launched a series of missile tests off the coast of the Korean peninsula. The country says the missiles have enough range to hit the United States. But the U.S. has said this weekend's events, they don't pose any immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory.  The tests do however highlight the destabilizing impact of North Korea's illegal missile program. North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un's sister warned of more threats to come unless the United States halts military drills with South Korea.  More now from Paula Hancocks, CNN international correspondent based in Seoul, South Korea. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It has been a busy few days on the Korean peninsula. North Korea on Saturday launching a significant missile. On Sunday and Monday, we have seen tit-for-tat retaliation from both sides -- North Korea, and also the U.S. and South Korea on the other side. So what we saw on Saturday, Pyongyang admitted a day later, was an intercontinental ballistic missile. Now these they claim can hit mainland United States and they are the ones that do concern Washington. We heard from Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un's sister, that this actually shows that they have missile re-entry technology.  Now, it's very difficult to know if that is in fact the case, but that is what Pyongyang is claiming at this point. So what we saw on Sunday then just one day later was a concerted show of force by the U.S. and South Korean air force, air forces. They flew sorties over the Korean peninsula, including at least one B-1 bomber, escorted by South Korean fighter jets and then in response to that, we saw this Monday morning from Pyongyang two launches.  Now they say that it was a super large multiple rocket launcher exercise in retaliation for what they saw the day before. So this is really a latest cycle of tit-for-tat retaliation, but certainly, the Saturday launch was the significant one. But we're not expecting the tensions or this tit for tat retaliation to diminish anytime soon, because Pyongyang says it is doing so because the U.S. and South Korea are carrying out joint military drills, and if they continue to do that, then they will continue to respond.  Now we know that this week at the Pentagon, there will be a nuclear tabletop drill between the U.S. and South Korea, and then next month, there will be a larger joint military drill between the two countries. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, we're traveling to Canada in search of zombies but not the type of zombies you'd typically think of. Ever heard of zombie fires, I had neither until now. They're essentially fires that were never totally put out at the end of a fire season and they burn underground threatening to come back from beneath the surface at any moment to wreak havoc once more. We'll hear more now from an international team of researchers who are on the hunt for the next fire that could be lurking beneath the earth's surface. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  In the remote boreal forests of Canada's Northwest Territories, and Rebecca Scholten, along with an international team of researchers, is on the hunt for signs of a rare and destructive phenomenon.  REBECCA SCHOLTEN, PHD STUDENT, VU AMSTERDAM:  So the first thing you notice when you get to a site that has had a zombie fire is that a lot of these trees have fallen over and that is because of the underground burning that is happening. REPORTER:  In 2015, this region of boreal forest was the scene of an overwintering fire also known as a zombie fire. These are rare so we don't have any footage of them but they can look just like these regular forest fires, except they're back from the dead. SCHOLTEN:  So these are fires that are not extinguished at the end of a fire season but instead, they smoldered deep into the organic soil layer and when the snow comes the snow kind of protects them from the adverse winter conditions and that makes it possible for them to smolder or throughout winter and when the snow melts and there's dry fuels available again these fires come up to the surface again and start a new flaming forest fire. REPORTER:  In 2021, Scholten published the first ever scientific study to detect zombie fires using satellites and reports from local fire managers as part of her PhD.  For example, in the summer of 2015, a fire in southwest Alaska blazed across 26 square miles. Winter came and snow covered the fire site. But the following spring, the fire returned along the old burn scar, evidence Scholten says of a zombie fire.  By burning through the soil and the roots, zombie fires can be more damaging to the forest than regular fires, making it harder for them to recover. But that's not all, these boreal soils store huge amounts of carbon, so burning them releases it as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Zombie fires are rare but Scholten found that they are increasing due to climate change. SCHOLTEN:  So I think zombie fires a very good poster child for what is happening to arctic wildfires in general. So we see fire regimes are intensifying and this has very important impact on the ecosystems that of course has an impact on our climate. And that is why I think everyone in the world should care about these fires. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these words comes from a Latin term that described a wind from the north? Zephyr, bluster, boreal, or arboreal? Zephyr was a west wind but when you're talking about a north wind, you're speaking in boreal terms.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh, yeah, it's going all the way. Oh, yeah, right above, wow look at how bright that is. SUBTITLE:  This erupting aurora was caught on camera in Alaska. Particles from explosions on the sun interact with atmospheric gases, creating the mesmerizing light displays.  Vincent Ledvina, a doctoral student in space physics, has been photographic polar lights for years. (MUSIC) (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. Today's story getting a 10 out of 10, a shark attack, only this time, it's the shark getting attacked by a dog. That's right, a big old hammerhead shark. One boater said it was probably about feet long, just minding this business in the Bahamas until a dog spots the monster cruising beneath the surface and cannonball, the dog jumps into the water and starts chasing the shark away. The people on the tour boat were screaming in disbelief in horror the dog is the pet of the caretaker who manages the private island.  Pardon my sarcasm little doggy, but something tells me year one jawsitively lucky pup. The boaters were relieved when the dog safely swam back to the shore unharmed. Fun fact for the day: did you know that baby sharks are called pups? Learn something new every day. Shout out time now. Hudsonville High School in Hudsonville, Michigan, we see you.  Also shout out to Mr. Ben Lewis at Brenham Middle School in Brenham, Texas. He challenged his students to interview a military veteran an immigrant and an American citizen over 60 years old. To learn about different perspectives and to gain better understanding of what it means to be an American, he turned the interviews into this book. Proceeds are going to help deserving military veterans.  We salute you, Mr. Lewis, and to all of the students who sent me a lovely note with all these signatures, you totally rocked it out.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Wonderful Wednesday to you. I'm Coy Wire, and we are so grateful that you're making us part of your day right here on CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news. Random thought for you before we start. Why is it that we park on a driveway, but we drive on a parkway? All right. Let's shift into high gear now. We start today with more on President Biden's visit to Ukraine. On Tuesday, the president gave a speech in Poland after making a surprise visit to Ukraine on Monday, nearly one year after Russia started its invasion there. The president recommitted the support of the United States and its resources to Ukraine. This despite the rising costs of sending aid. The U.S. has already given about $30 billion and recent polls show public support for America continuing to send weapons to Ukraine is fading as well, down to 48 percent last month when 60 percent of Americans supported it back in May. Just hours earlier on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin slammed the West in his annual state of the nation Address in Moscow, casting Russia as the victim, saying that it was Ukraine and its Western allies who started the war. He says Russia's military efforts in Ukraine are to protect themselves and Putin offered no signs of backing down from their presence in Ukraine. So why did President Biden risk entering an active war zone that isn't showing any signs of settling down in the near future? Biden was not the first president to make a trip to a war zone, but he is the first to do so without a U.S. military presence in the region to protect him. Here's CNN's Brian Todd to tell us about other U.S. presidents who traveled to war zones and why they did that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It was at the height of World War II and the conflict still wasn't going America's way. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt engaged in a high-stakes game of misdirection, tricking journalists into thinking he was taking a train to his home in Upstate New York, but he secretly switched trains in Baltimore, headed to Miami, then took a series of arduous plane hops and ended up in Casablanca, Morocco. It was January 1943, the first time a sitting American president rode on an airplane, a trip shrouded in secrecy so that FDR could strategize with Winston Churchill, a journey fraught with danger. TIM NAFTALI, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  In World War II, you not only had the possibility of the commander-in-chief being shot down, but the technology was such that air travel was not as safe in the 1940s as it is today. TODD:  Some U.S. troops in Morocco didn't know their president was coming until he rode past them in a Jeep. Historians say war zone trips for American presidents have always been complicated, even dating back to the civil war. LINDSAY CHERVINSKY, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  At least presidents have gone to war zones in the past starting of course with Abraham Lincoln in the civil war. There are those famous pictures of him in his top hat visiting union soldiers to boost their morale. But it is a big risk. TODD:  Lyndon B. Johnson went twice as president. Richard Nixon once to Vietnam while the war there was raging. DOUGLAS BRINKLEY, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN, RICE UNIVERSITY:  I know when Nixon went in 1969 to Saigon, all of his advisors were saying don't do it, it's too dangerous. TODD:  George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump went to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit U.S. troops. NAFTALI:  When those presidents went to Kabul and Baghdad respectively, they were taking huge risks. TODD:  When George H.W. Bush as a former president visited Kuwait in 1993, Saddam Hussein's intelligence service tried to have Iraqi operatives assassinate him, a plot that was narrowly foiled. Presidents have taken these risks to boost troops morale, to strategize with other commanders and sometimes to decide whether a war should even continue. DWIGHT EISENHOWER, FORMER PRESIDENT:  I shall go to Korea. TODD:  That was Dwight D. Eisenhower's objective as president-elect when he took a secret trip to South Korea in December 1952. NAFTALI:  Eisenhower not only went to meet the troops, not only went to meet the South Korean leader, but actually took a plane over Chinese and North Korean positions to get a view himself of the nature of their defenses. That's an extremely hazardous trip. (END VIDEOTAPE) TODD (on camera):  Historian Tim Naftali says despite the sometimes- incredible risks, the rewards are very high, that as commander-in-chief, it's crucial for a president to show their commitment to the fight and to show that not only to American forces but to their adversaries as well. WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What Italian city is also known by the nickname La Serenissima? Palermo, Genoa, Venice or Florence? Meaning serene, La Serenissima was a nickname for the Republic of Venice. Ah, Venice, the floating city with people being serenaded and gondolas as they drift through winding canals under hundreds of walkways and bridges. But those famous canals look a lot different right now. They're so dried up that many of the gondolas and water taxis are sadly sitting on empty waterways. And there are fears that Italy will face a drought for a second straight summer following an extremely dry winter. Now, these images are a stark contrast from those of just a few years ago. In 2019, water poured into restaurants, shops and famous landmarks like Saint Mark's Basilica in Venice as it battled its worst flood in 50 years. Here's reporting from CNN international correspondent Scott McLean during that time as we try to imagine the scope of issues Venetians had to deal with the last several years. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  High tide on Saturday was actually welcome relief for Venetians struggling with the worst flooding in half a century. It filled historic Saint Mark's Square but was not enough to do more damage than already done. This cafe opened for the first time since Tuesday's high watermark sent more than a foot of water inside enough to break the dishwasher and the fridge. This waiter told us, we are Venetians, roll up our sleeves and start working again. Venice is our lady; we will protect her. Meanwhile at Saint Mark's Basilica, the water at the door didn't knock before entering. But it still got their attention. PIERPAOLO CAMPOSTRINI, ST. MARK'S BASILICA BOARD MEMBER:  We have a -- we have more than this level of water. MCLEAN:  It's not uncommon for water to enter the outer atrium. It was even a special drainage system to handle it. But Pierpaolo Campostrini says it was just the second time there's been significant flooding in the main chamber. Ten centimeters there and another meter in the crypt the water came and went quickly but the salt in the water stays in the 900-year-old walls much longer, eating away at the marble and brick near the floor and even on the mosaic ceiling. And that's the damage. CAMPOSTRINI:  And that's the damage. MCLEAN:  The basilica has survived centuries of threats but nothing like the one it faces today. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's story getting a 10 out of 10, you're going to meet George, a young Detroit Red Wings fan who went to his very first game and he and his mom were in for a huge surprise when George became a big time hit on the jumbotron. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It was George's first hockey game and the jumbotron eat him up. Detroit Red Wing fans booing. Opposing fans from Vancouver cheering. Every time George came up, even if he didn't quite get it, the opposition -- (BOOS) MOOS:  The home team -- (CHEERS) MOOS:  George finally cracked a smile and went viral. King George, they called him. I see a George bobblehead night. But it didn't give George a big head. CHELSEA MILLER, MOM:  Like he didn't know it was about him, and just kept saying like, yes, red team's winning. MOOS:  Chelsea Miller describes her four-year-old son as shy amid a whirlwind of attention. MILLER:  There were probably at least 100 people that asked to stop to take pictures with him and high fives and can I get an autograph even. MOOS:  Mom says they were hoping his sign would get George on camera, but they weren't expecting this. MILLER:  Everyone just made it so special for us. MOOS:  University of Michigan hockey wondered, George, do you need a Michigan jersey for the next game? George's grandma here and he definitely needs a jersey.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, lovely people? It's Thursday. So happy Friday eve and welcome to CNN 10. I'm Coy Wire. Happy to be with you today. Let's dominate this day. We're going to start with big news on the weather front. a massive winter storm is threatening the United States coast to coast all the way from California in the West to Maine in the east. On Wednesday, more than 65 million Americans were under winter weather alerts. Warning of severe icing and extreme cold making driving and flying very dangerous. More than 1,000 flights in the U.S. had already been canceled on Wednesday at the time of the show's taping, and more than 2 million people are under blizzard warnings across parts of Wyoming, the Dakotas, Wisconsin and Minnesota. The Minneapolis area in Minnesota could see historic snowfall totals. On Tuesday, in northern California, strong wind gusts knocked the power out in than 140 homes and businesses. And northern Californians can also expect to see several in inches of snow. We'll continue to track this storm right here on CNN 10, but please, be smart and stay safe. Next up, an update on the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, which spilled toxic chemicals that are threatening the health and well-being of residents there. Wednesday morning, the Environmental Protection Agency ordered Norfolk Southern rail company to cover all of the cleanup costs, but the rail company is facing further pressure. Residents and state officials still have questions about the rail company's handling of the situation, and they seek to hold them accountable for any potential wrongdoing. CNN's Miguel Marquez is in East Palestine with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A toxic mess left by its derailed train, now President Joe Biden adding his pressure on Norfolk Southern, following criticism for his response to the crash. On Instagram, Biden wrote, Norfolk Southern's imposed payments and cleanup operations are common sense because, quote, this is their mess, and they should clean it up. The company is reiterating its commitment to East Palestine residents. ALAN SHAW, CEO, NORFOLK SOUTHERN:  From day one, I've made the commitment that Norfolk Southern is going to remediate the site. MARQUEZ:  But still, it is facing accusations of mismanagement like this from Pennsylvania's Governor Josh Shapiro. GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D), PENNSYLVANIA:  They chose not to participate in the unified command. They gave us inaccurate information and conflicting modeling data. SHAW:  I was at unified command, and I can tell you that the governors of Ohio and Pennsylvania, Mayor Conaway, Fire Chief Drabick, the National Guard and Norfolk Southern were aligned that the control burned, the control release was the safest course of action for the citizens of East Palestine. MARQUEZ:  Governor Shapiro announced a criminal referral to the attorney general's office over the crash and its fallout. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine also said his attorney general is reviewing possible legal action against Norfolk Southern. But the train company says it is committed to helping East Palestine for the long haul. SHAW:  We're going to do continuous long-term air and water monitoring. We're going to help the residents of this community recover and we're going to invest in the long-term health of this community and we're going to make Norfolk Southern a safer railroad. MARQUEZ:  According to its CEO, Norfolk Southern has reimbursed $6.5 million to East Palestine residents so far. This as the company continues to monitor air and water quality there. It says hundreds of tests conducted have come back clean. During a visit to East Palestine, head of the EPA Michael Regan said he's confident in the tests. MICHAEL REGAN, EPA ADMINISTRATOR:  Our data is very solid and if the homes have been cleared and tested for drinking water, then we trust that data. So we feel really good about that. MARQUEZ:  To prove that Regan and Governor DeWine drank from the same water sources that are being tested. However, Governor DeWine says more work needs to be done to remove contaminated soil from the area. GOV. MIKE DEWINE (R), OHIO:  The soil under the tracks had not been dealt with. So, under the administrator's order, that soil will be removed, so the tracks will have to be taken up and that soil will have to be removed. MARQUEZ:  Despite all these actions and guarantees, East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway says his community is still concerned about overall safety. MAYOR TRENT CONAWAY, EAST PALESTINE, OHIO:  We need our whole town cleaned up. We need our residents to feel safe in their homes. That's the number one thing. Your home is your sanctuary. If you don't feel safe in your home, then you're never going to feel safe anywhere. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, as part of the fallout from the suspected Chinese spy balloon that flew over the United States earlier this month, the U.S. announced a new round of sanctions or penalties against six Chinese aerospace companies that they believe supported a Chinese military reconnaissance balloon program. Today in a CNN exclusive, Will Ripley takes us to a place few outsiders have seen to try to learn more about what the secretive manufacturers could be up to. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Hundreds of miles from Beijing, a place China does not want you to see. CNN, the first international media to come here. Behind the sea of barbed wire and security checkpoints, the base of a blacklisted balloon manufacturer, one of six Chinese entities the U.S. government sanctioned after that suspected spy balloon. Shot down, pulled up, and sent to an FBI lab, each piece providing more proof, the U.S. says, this was no weather balloon, deflating denial after denial by Beijing. China's foreign ministry calls the whole thing an accident, the balloon, an unmanned civilian airship. CNN searched for the truth behind the balloon, took our team from the Chinese capital to a Shanxi province, about 300 miles southwest of Beijing. Days of digging and geolocation technology took us down this road to a place few outsiders have seen. No international media has ever come this close. What did we find? An active industrial complex with possible ties to the Chinese military's vast, highly secretive aerospace program. Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology, or EMAST, blacklisted by the U.S. Commerce Department. CNN searched corporate records suggesting EMAST has permits to develop and manufacture products for the Chinese military. The first thing we noticed, a giant white dome. A closer look shows the company logo. Inside that dome, a lab. We dug up a 2017 Chinese state media report. The report says this is where workers test high altitude balloons like the one that flew over the U.S. Our team spotted two more massive structures. They look like giant tents. CNN cameras also captured what seems to be an assault helicopter on display. And listen to this. That same state media report never once does it mention meteorology. It boasts the balloons can carry multiple detectors, communications equipment used for civilian and military surveillance and reconnaissance. CNN tried to get answer from all six companies on the U.S. blacklist. No response from EMAST or the others. They are not talking about the balloon, but President Joe Biden is. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I make no apologies for taking down that balloon. RIPLEY:  A suspected spy balloon. We may never know for sure who made it. China is sticking to its weather balloon claim dismissed by the Pentagon as nothing but hot air. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these countries is the world's largest producer of oranges? Mexico, United States, Brazil or Cyprus? About one-third of the world's oranges are grown in Brazil. (MUSIC) WIRE:  It's the annual battle of the oranges at the Ivrea Carnival. Thousands of people taking part in the biggest food fight in Italy. The battles, oranges date back to nearly a thousand years, representing a revolt by the commoners in Ivrea, who would rise up against the evil tyrannical duke's armies. The town is festooned with banners, pennants and plenty of OJ. The oranges are said to be unsuitable for commercial purposes, so the citrus slingers hurl more than 4 million oranges during the three days of celebration leading up to lent. All right. Shout out time now. It's going out to Tolland High School in Tolland, Connecticut, today. Rise up. And thanks to all who made #yourwordwednesday submission, like Leta DeRays (ph) from Central High in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Today's word, festoon. If you heard it, it means to adorn a place with decorations. Before we go, one more thing: one of the greatest characteristics we can possess as we chase our goals is not ability, it's adaptability. The top achievers in this world don't have all the answers in the beginning nor do they have all the tools they need to succeed. Our goals they may seem unattainable at times, and we will fail as we chase them. But if we keep pushing and become like a chameleon and keep adapting, good things will happen. See you tomorrow, lovely people. I'm Coy and we are CNN 10. END230224

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, lovely people? The weekend is upon us. It is Friday and Friday's rock. We are fueled up and ready to rock it out with you. This the best minutes in news, so let's go, We start with continuing coverage on the intense weather systems sweeping across the United States there's a strong chance that many of you watching right now have already seen your neighborhood impacted. More than 65 million people across 29 states from as far west as California to as far east as Maine were under winter weather alerts, warning of heavy snow, severe icing, extreme cold. Eight hundred and fifty thousand people went without power, more than 1,700 flights were canceled. But we are seeing two extremes across the country right now while a powerful storm is setting record low temperatures across the northern plains, at the same time, there is a heat wave in the southeast setting record high temperatures for the month of February. Can you believe that there is a difference of more than degrees between some places right here in the United States. More now from Brian Todd, a CNN correspondent based in the network's Washington bureau who tells us of the dangers that this storm is bringing to people all across the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In Wyoming, a state trooper has to scramble out of the way as a runaway truck almost hits him. Dangerous conditions on a snowy road in Truckee, California, caused this car to flip. In Flagstaff, Arizona, the snow was so violent that this man told CNN it literally knocked him backward as he and his dog struggled to see and keep their footing. A sweeping massive storm system is pummeling much of the country from California to Maine. More than 65 million people under winter weather alerts across the West, Midwest, and Northeast. The Minneapolis/St. Paul area could get around 20 inches by the time it's over. It could be the most snow that area has seen in three decades. Minnesota's governor discussed the dangers they prepared for. GOV. TIM WALZ (D), MINNESOTA:  The goal is to not to have to pull somebody off the interstate, but we're prepared to do so if that happens. The goal is to make sure that we're ready if there's power losses, being able to keep the highways and move emergency vehicles as quickly as we can. TODD:  Conditions so severe in Minnesota that ambulances have to be specially equipped. RYAN MAYFIELD, HENNEPIN HEALTHCARE EMS ASSISTANT CHIEF:  We have shovels in our ambulances. We have salt and sand mixtures as well to help us out. We have a few sleds if we need to use them. TODD:  California getting hit with snow in places that don't often experience it. DANIEL SWAIN, CLIMATE SCIENTIST, UCLA:  We are going to see low snow all the way from the Oregon border to the Mexican border. TODD:  North of Los Angeles, a long stretch of vehicles is stopped on state route 58 as the highway patrol warns motorists. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are asking everybody to avoid the area, make alternate plans, drive a different day. TODD:  But in different areas, different impacts. Near San Jose, high winds snap trees, brought down power lines, and caused widespread power outages. DIANE CHERMAK, SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA, RESIDENT:  These old Victorians, the wood is so old, if there's a spark that that's what really worries me. TODD:  High winds caused so-called brownout conditions and several vehicle accidents in the Texas panhandle. And with this massive system thousands of flights have been canceled according to the flight tracking site Flight Aware. It says the airports in Minneapolis-St. Paul Detroit and Denver are getting hit hardest. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: A group of penguins in the water is referred to as which of the following? Huddle, colony, water or raft? Wouldn't you know it, all of these are named for a collective of penguins, but a raft refers to a group of penguins in the water. Up next, we're taking a trip to see some penguins in need of some help. Now, first of all I thought all penguins lived in cold snowy regions but that's not true. In fact, there are penguins that can be found waddling around the warm dry shores in South Africa with not a major snowbank in sight. We learn something new every day on the show. This particular penguin population though is dwindling in large part because they're having trouble making their nests. So, humans are stepping in to build them some sweet new digs. CNN went to check in on the tuxedo birds and we'll go there now to learn some more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  Antarctica is known to have the largest population of penguins in the world, but not all penguins live in snow and ice. Some can be found waddling along the balmy shores of southern Africa, on barren and windswept islands like this one. But in the last century, populations of the endangered African penguin have plummeted, due in part to human disturbance, egg poaching and climate change. TRUDI MALAN, CONSERVATION MANAGER, DYER ISLAND CONSERVATION TRUST:  Dyer Island in the 1970s, there was about breeding pairs. At the moment, we're counting breeding pairs. It's quite a severe collapse. REPORTER:  Historically, African penguins made nests in boroughs of guano, layers of accumulated seabird and bad feces. But in the 19th century, humans began to exploit guano supplies and sell it as fertilizer, leaving penguins and their eggs exposed to predators and a scorching sun. KEVIN GRAHAM, ASSOCIATE CURATOR, DALLAS ZOO/AZA SAFE:  At one point in the colonies, it ranged from three to 10 meters in depth and even deeper in some areas. Right now, the deepest guano remaining in any of the colony's measures in the centimeters, the only thing left is bare gravel, bare oil, nothing that they can burrow into and that took away their entire nesting ability. REPORTER:  In 2016, the African Penguin Nest Project dived to the rescue, a coordinated effort between Dyer Island Conservation Trust, Dallas Zoo and other organizations. Its mission is to design and deploy artificial nests that give penguin parents a safe and cool place to raise their chicks. After two years of development and studying old guano nests, project experts settled on a final design which they started deploying in late 2018. The aim was to emulate mother nature as closely as possible. GRAHAM:  We made the entrance hall small so that the penguins can squeeze in and as soon as they turn around, they can protect that entrance hole from any predator it looks a little bit strange when you look at it but it's an exact copy of what the penguins build themselves if they were given the opportunity. REPORTER:  Each nest is fitted with a sensor that measures temperature and humidity which enables researchers to track the nest's microclimate. GRAHAM:  Eggs are an extremely delicate structure. They're only set to be incubated at about 38 to 39 degrees. Any higher than that, and there's a very real risk of the eggs dying. We're going to constantly be looking at the performance of the nests when it comes to the usage rates, are the penguins using them? Are the eggs hatching? Are the chicks fledging? But so far, what we're seeing is that the artificial nests are fledging chicks at a much higher rate than any other option that they have. REPORTER:  Funded by donations or by people sponsoring individual nests, Graham says the project is so far installed more than 1,500 nests around South Africa's penguin colonies. Next year, the project hopes to expand to penguin colonies in Namibia. The end goal is that every penguin that needs a nest will get one. MALAN:  I think we have got a responsibility as humans because you know we've kind of intruded onto a place and messed things up a little bit, but we also can fix it. I never think of an African penguin as cute and cuddly. I think of an African penguin as absolutely tenacious. I think there are such survivors and they should be an example to all of us that you can overcome. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10, a pup with a celebrity smile. Check out this crooked grin canine. Its name, Paul Ruff, named after actor Paul Rudd. It's his doggy doppelganger. Ruff was a shelter dog in Tennessee, but the good news is he found a forever home after he went viral when people pointed out that he had a celebrity twin. All right.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, sunshine? Welcome back. Hope you had a wonderful weekend. I'm Coy Wire, here with you so we can fuel our minds, dominate this week and have a little bit of fun while doing it.  Our lead story on CNN 10 today, the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Friday marked one year since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a large-  scale attack of neighboring Ukraine. It's been a full year of destruction and loss of life. It's been a time where Ukraine has fought back and its allies have come forward to penalize Russia with sanctions on their economy while sending millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has received international praise for his wartime leadership but he has also been criticized. For one, he didn't warn Ukrainian citizens of the impending invasion ahead of time. Why? He says the decision prevented financial panic and that it better preserved Ukraine's economy in order to fund the fight against Russia.  So when might this war end? At a ceremony on Friday, which remembered a somber in anniversary of events that are changing lives forever, Zelenskyy vowed to push for a Ukrainian victory in 2023.  The day was full of commemorations, reflections and tears. But Zelenskyy's tone remained strong and he spoke of the country's resilience during Europe's largest and deadliest war since World War II. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT:  Slava Ukraini. BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  His exchanges with Ukrainian soldiers today were vintage Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy told his army they would be the ones to decide whether Ukraine will exist in the future or not. But one year after Russia's invasion, few doubt that Ukraine's fate hinges in no small part on the man who emerge as an effective war time leader. JOHN HERBST, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE:  The man has a spine. And obviously when you are truly David fighting Goliath, if you don't have a spine, you lose. WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE:  Twelve months later he is the hard bitten leader. I mean, he has been through a year of trial like no other leader. TODD:  And from the first moments of the war it seemed like Zelenskyy was up to the challenge, like when he posted a video message on Facebook from the streets of Kyiv with his cabinet on the second night of the invasion. ZELENSKYY (through translator):  The president is here. We are all here. Our military is here. TODD:  Volodymyr Zelenskyy has since dominated the narrative, from a stirring appearance before joint session of the U.S. Congress. ZELENSKYY:  Ukraine is alive and kicking. TODD:  To what he said to the British House of Commons. ZELENSKYY:  We will not give up and we will not lose. We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, on the streets. TODD:  Compare that to what Winston Churchill said after the evacuation of Dunkirk. WINSTON CHURCHILL, FORMER BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  We shall fight in the fields and in the streets. We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender. BORIS JOHNSON, FORMER BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  He has successfully mimicked Winston Churchill himself. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has mobilized the United States of America. TODD:  Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor remembers Zelenskyy in the early months of his presidency as a good natured, somewhat naive politician. How has the war changed Zelenskyy? TAYLOR:  He's less jovial. He's less -- he's more focused. He's more determined. He's more somber. I mean, this is a hard -- a hard time to go through and he's had it all on his shoulders. TODD:  Still, no one's been able to keep Volodymyr Zelenskyy from the front lines in places like Kherson and Bucha compare that to Vladimir Putin's isolation in the Kremlin. KEITH DARDEN, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY:  He appears fearful. I mean, you get the sense that of a man alone, whereas, Zelenskyy is among his people, among his team and in the fight. (END VIDEOTAPE) TODD (on camera):  The analysts we spoke to say that unless Volodymyr Zelenskyy makes some colossal and unforeseen mistakes, his legacy will likely be very impressive. If Ukraine wins the war, he'll go down as one of the greatest leaders of the century if Ukraine loses he's remembered as a tragic hero. WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these nations is the most populated nation on the African continent? Ethiopia, Nigeria, Egypt or South Africa? Nigeria with around 220 million people is the most populated country in Africa. And up next, we're headed to Nigeria, the country is Africa's largest democracy and its people are voting to elect their next president and vice president. The election comes at a time when two-thirds of the population are living in poverty and almost half of the young people are unemployed the value of the currency there is low while inflation is high and violence and terrorism have reshaped everyday life across the nation. We'll hear now from CNN international correspondent Larry Madowo as Nigerians are making their voices heard in one of the country's most competitive and unpredictable elections in quite some time. (BEGN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it was now close nationwide in Nigeria's tightest election ever, and what happens now is the slow painstaking process of counting the vote. What do you have back there is they hold up a ballot one by one, everybody watching has to agree that that's the person that they voted for and so that will take a while -- which is why we can't predict exactly when the results will be known.  The independent National Electoral Commission says they will do it speedily it might be a couple of days until we know. There were a few reported instances of violence and parts of Lagos and other parts of the country. But these are isolated. It's not a pattern that we can see at least apparently.  There were also at least polling stations where voting didn't take place because of insecurity and security has been a major issue for voters in this election. But the election is taking part in the backdrop of a major fuel and cash shortage. It's led to some chaotic scenes at gas stations and at banks and now whoever becomes an expression of Nigeria has to deal with an economy on the verge of crumbling there are people running, but only three men have a realistic chance of becoming the next president of Africa's most populous nation.  During election is a massive logistical nightmare. Ninety-three million registered voters is more than the next 14 West African nations combined. So it's sort of like organizing election for an entire subcontinent in just one day, and that's why at this location for instance, two of the polling stations there were no votes happening and they don't understand why but people we spoke to told us that we wait for as long as it takes because they want to make a statement in this election. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, sports fans. Take me out to the ball game. Just don't make me stay all day. New rules in Major League Baseball aimed at speeding up the game or taking spring training by storm. MLB is implementing a pitch clock, sort of like a shot clock in basketball. Pitchers and batters, they can't take their good old time anymore, just 15 seconds between pitches with empty bases, 20 seconds when there are runners on base. If pitchers don't get the pitch off in time, it counts as a ball for the batter.  But the rule also states that if the batter isn't ready by eight seconds left well like the Padres Manny Machado found out, they're going to get a strike called against him. Well, with this new rule, we're seeing spring training games finishing around to minutes faster than last year's average of three hours and three minutes. We've seen some games that finished an hour faster.  Now some other big rule changes this season, pitchers can only attempt two pick-off throws per at bat. The size of the bases is increasing from 15 square inches to 18, and defenses can no longer shift their infielders. Players have about a month to retrain their brains before the season opening day is March 30th. For today's story getting a 10 out of 10, a two-month-old baby that already weighs 50 pounds meet Petunia, a two-month-old baby hippopotamus at the Metro Richmond Zoo in Virginia. And not just any hippo, Petunia and her mama Iris are pygmy hippos and there are fewer than mature pygmy hippos remaining in the world. So with each step and with each splash in the pool, Petunia is keeping hope for these hippos alive. All right. Time's almost up for today but for all my go-getters out there, one more thing. Remember complacency is the constant enemy so outwork everyone every single day. Shout out to West Lauderdale High school in Collinsville, Mississippi. Go Knights!  We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10. END230228

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey there, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. We have a special edition of CNN 10 today. We'll end with our typical 10 out of 10 story, but we're going to start with a feature piece on the future, specifically of travel. Planes, trains and automobiles those are typically the modes of transportation we think about when we travel today, but some folks are reimagining a future where the new modes of transportation are so efficient and so fast. It could break the speed of sound. That would make the entire world more accessible. Instead of going to a friend's house across town for dinner, someday we might be talking about zipping over to a friend's house across an ocean. One of the potential new forms of travel in CNN's "The Next Frontier": kind of reminds me of a scene from that blockbuster movie "Elf". (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Through the sea of swirly, twirly gum drops. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  That's right. Being shot through a tube super-fast. CNN business correspondent Rahel Solomon has more about "The Next Frontier". (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Whether through the air, along the track or on the road, modern day transportation has transformed the way we travel on a global scale, allowing mobility like never before. But as growing populations and densely packed cities stress these systems, innovators around the world are imaginating faster more sustainable ways to get from A to B. From supersonic planes to hyperloop pods, what may seem like a pipe dream today could be the future of transit as early as three decades from now. To envision the future of travel, you should first look to the past. To a city that heralded modern day transportation, innovation. ALISYN MALEK, MANAGING DIRECTOR, NEWLAB DETROIT:  Detroit is the Motor City it's known the world over. We put the world on wheels. It was here that Henry Ford pioneered the production lines that allowed us to more quickly produce vehicles in a way that improved quality and allowed more people to be able to afford cars. I'm Alisyn Malek and I'm the managing director of Newlab Detroit. I'm working to help bring a better, more prosperous vision of mobility for everyone around the world. When I think about urban mobility, some of the key pillars that are really critical for that to be successful are accessibility, how easy are the mobility solutions to get to how frequent are the services running, what areas are covered. As we look towards 2050, we're going to be getting up close to 9 billion people. From a transportation perspective, it's really about options and making sure that everybody has at least two if not more of how they can get around. A lot of the systems that we're using were great. They are still great, but we actually need to think about what other solutions can we put out that are useful and also create a great user experience. SOLOMON:  One solution that's certainly gotten a lot of hype over the last decade is the hyperloop. The proposed train in a tube is looking to upend the way we travel, with speeds up to a thousand kilometers per hour it could zoom across an entire continent and just a few hours. Netherlands-based Hardt Hyperloop is aiming to bring this high-speed technology to life. MARS GEUZE, CO-FOUNDER, HARDT HYPERLOOP:  Our vision is to create a world where distance doesn't matter, where it's possible for you to be much more free in where you live, work and how you travel, to really shrink the world for people to live in. To me, the next frontier is to realize sustainable, high-speed and convenient transport of passengers and goods. SOLOMON:  This future forward concept is actually built on the backbone of a 19th century idea where compressed air propelled rail cars through a network of pipes. Today, hyperloop technology is based on two key mechanisms, removing aerodynamic drag through vacuum-like tubes and removing friction through magnetic levitation or maglev, which makes the pods float and move forward. Together, these systems allow hyperloop to achieve ultra-fast speeds. GEUZE:  Now, we're in the first integrated test track that we've built. We've tested a 4,000 kilo or 8,000 pounds vehicle to really show the normal loads that you would have on a tube and that you can still have your levitation system carry that weight. MALEK:  Hyperloop as a technology is very interesting. It does work. You're cutting down on things like drag and friction. High level from a basic physics perspective, that's really interesting. SOLOMON:  And according to Geuze, those properties of physics are what make hyperloop better for the environment. GEUZE:  In a hyperloop, because you remove the aerodynamic resistance, you reduce the energy consumption and therefore you become a much more sustainable solution. SOLOMON:  Companies across the globe are racing to make their own hyperloop, but Geuze says it's more collaborative than competitive with a collective goal to make the world more connected. GEUZE:  There's already a lot of work being done on setting up a regulatory framework to ensure that we finally converge to a single interoperable hyperloop network. SOLOMON:  Seven pioneering hyperloop companies have announced they are joining forces to launch the first global hyperloop association. It includes companies like Transpod, Hyperloop One and Zeleros. This newly formed pact aims to help grow this emerging transportation market as well as work with government and regulatory agencies on policy making. As we look to the future for hyperloop, Malek says the technology is there it'll come down to how it performs against current options. MALEK:  How does the capability of hyperloop match up against competitive technologies, and does it have a reason to win? We're still seeing really great performance out of technologies like maglev trains, which are being used in Asia quite a bit already. GEUZE:  I think is realistic that in 2015, you could have a global hyperloop network up and running. What motivates me the most is that if we can get this done, it will have a massive impact in bringing sustainability to our mobility patterns. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. Continuing with our news on travel, we'll take a look at the original form of travel and that's by foot. And sometimes when you travel, you want to travel in style. Well, what say you about these kicks that took New York fashion week by storm? The aptly named Big Red Boot make you look like you walked right out of a Super Mario game. Would you rock 'em? I don't know if I would. CNN's Jeanne Moos has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  These boots are made for flaunting fashion influencers are styling them. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's a goofy shoe. I give them a 10 out of 10. MOOS:  Even influencers of the grandpa generation. Wrestler Seth Rollins pretends stomped his opponent wearing big red boots. Ever since they went on sale for 350 bucks and sold out in minutes, fashionistas can't shut up about the Big Red Boots created by the art collective MSCHF. They do make you want to touch them. STEVE NATTO, TIKTOK/@STEVENATTO24:  Yeah, yeah. MOOS:  YouTube sneakerhead Steve Natto found that out when he wore them to sneaker con. NATTO:  And some people asked to touch the shoot. MOOS:  How do they feel? Well, the top part -- NATTO:  Its flexible but the bottom part is definitely not. MOOS:  Steve says they're comfy. He wore them all day without pain. Their creator describes them as cartoonish. Some refer to them as Astro Boy boots. And though they're easy to put on, getting them off can get you stuck if you're not wearing your perfect size. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My foot got stuck so I had to do -- I have to do what I had to do, man. MOOS:  Now they're showing up on everyone from puss in big red boots to the character boots from Dora the Explorer to Tony Soprano paired with a bathrobe. People wanted to buy them right off Steve's feet offering -- NATTO:  I got like 800, 900, a thousand. I think I got like 1,300 or 1,400. They just kind of kept going up. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. All you boot-tiful people, thanks for spending part of your day with us. Today is February 28th, National Pancake Day. So happy stacking if that's your speeding and try them with peanut butter if you're feeling frisky. Shout out to Schroeder Middle School today in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Go Raiders!

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Wonderful Wednesday to you. I know we're just halfway through the week but we're going to keep grinding and shining because that's just what we do. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and we've got a rendezvous with the news. We're going to start with news on a vegetable shortage in the United Kingdom. Certain fruits and veggies are having to be rationed at most major supermarkets and four of the biggest supermarkets in the United Kingdom say they're putting purchase limits on some staple items like tomatoes peppers and cucumbers. Experts say this could go on for months. Some farmers are saying that they're not harvesting any tomatoes, peppers or eggplants when they usually do at this time of year. A number of factors like bad weather conditions in Spain and Morocco, high energy costs over the winter and even the impact of Brexit and the labor shortages are causing the lack of production. Here's CNN anchor and correspondent Isa Soares in London who's been speaking with local shoppers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Row upon row of empty baskets, empty shelves. A supply gap in fruit and veg has hit UK supermarkets, the shortages affecting shoppers nationwide. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I went for lunch, and I couldn't find it like tomatoes cucumber or lettuce. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It was quite annoying when you weren't trying to get your private day in, and you can't actually get it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The fruits I want to they're gone, nothing there. SOARES:  To deal with the shortages, major British supermarkets are imposing limits on items like tomatoes cucumbers and peppers. The UK's minister for the environment food and rural affairs said a disruption should only last a few weeks, and meanwhile encouraged people to eat more seasonally. Let them eat turnips, she said. THERESE COFFEY, UK MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT:  I'm conscious that consumers want a year-round choice and that is what our supermarkets and food and growers' food producers and growers around the world try to satisfy. SOARES:  Supermarkets are blaming the recent shortages on poor weather conditions in key growing regions. Britain produces a fraction of the food it consumes, relying instead on overseas imports. And key supplies in southern Europe and North Africa, in particular Spain and Morocco, have seen harvests hit by extreme weather conditions. But while climate change plays a significant role in warmer than average temperatures, the government faces another inconvenient truth -- Brexit, the cause of widespread supply chain disruption. LIZ WEBSTER, CHAIR OF SAVE BRITISH FARMING:  Because of the interruption with trade and Europe who kind of underpin our food supply, it means that there's less food coming in from Europe. We're producing less food. So basically, our food security is in real trouble. SOARES:  Labor shortages due to a lack of migrant workers and soaring energy prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine have pushed the gap even wider as farmers struggle with front-end costs. And those costs are passed on to the consumer. Consumers already grappling with record high grocery prices and the worst cost of living crisis in decades. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Where would you find the world's oldest airport? Paris, France; Hamburg, Germany; Maryland, USA; or North Carolina, USA? Flights began at Maryland's College Park Airport in 1909 when Wilbur Wright trained two military pilots. And up next, we're continuing with part two of our feature from yesterday on the future of travel. New technology in the years to come will likely change travel as we know it forever. The planes, trains and automobiles we use today may someday be as antiquated as the horse and buggy. Thought leaders in the travel industry are formulating plans that might make travel faster, cheaper and safer. From hyperloops to air taxis to supersonic jets, here's CNN's Rahel Solomon with more on "The Next Frontier". (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  From highways to railways, flight paths to bike lanes, we have plenty of mobility options on the ground and in the air. But could the next frontier in transit take place over water? One sea-bearing startup is looking to turn coastlines into corridors. BILLY THALHEIMER, CEO, REGENT:  Water transportation is super important because 40 percent of the world lives within coastal communities. I'm Billy Thalheimer, co-founder and CEO at Regent. MIKE KLINKER, CTO, REGENT:  I'm Mike Klinker, one of the co-founders and CTO at Regent. THALHEIMER:  The next frontier is better transportation and when I say better, I mean efficient and sustainable. It's faster, it's easy and affordable and accessible. SOLOMON:  Rhode Island-based company Regent is aiming to enhance the way we travel between seaboard cities and islands with a new mode of transportation, the sea glider. KLINKER:  The sea glider is really a mix between a boat and airplane. You took the two, smashed them together. THALHEIMER:  They combined the affordability and accessibility and convenience of a boat, of ferry transportation with the high speed and long ranges of an aircraft. SOLOMON:  The all-electric maritime vehicle is designed to float, foil and fly along dock-to-dock routes. KLINKER:  The sea glider has three modes of operation. It can be floating so like a normal boat would, floating on the surface of the water, driving around in the inner harbor areas. It has a hydrofoiling mode where you're up above the surface of water on these still so the passengers and the vehicle are insulated with any waves. The last mode is the fly mode. SOLOMON:  The sea glider takes advantage of a few water and air efficiencies to operate. Underwater wings called hydrofoils help lift the sea glider, reduce drag and allow for a smooth ride above the waves. When it's time to take off, the hydrofoils retract and the sea glider won't fly within a wingspan of the water surface, benefiting from an aerodynamic principle called ground effect to glide along a cushion of air. KLINKER:  The sea gliders were powered by 12 by 100 horsepower electric motors and propellers on the leading edge of the wing. Those are all fueled by battery technologists, the same batteries that go into electric cars today. SOLOMON:  The first sea glider called Viceroy will carry 12 passengers, two crew and service short hauls up to 290 kilometers at speeds just under 300 kilometers per hour. Regent is still in the prototype phase, but Thalheimer says they've already proven that technology works. THALHEIMER:  Regent just hit our two-year anniversary. We built the first sea glider prototype and actually proved that this mode of transportation is possible. This is how we typically test our quarter scale prototype sea glider. So, we're really experimenting with all operations floating, foiling. When you get out of this tight area like this out into the open water, that's when we take off and we become that wing and ground effect that high-speed flying vehicle. SOLOMON:  And inside, they're developing the avionics which will be operated by a captain. KLINKER:  There's really two ways that you control the sea glider. You have a power lever and a side stick joystick. So, think of it like you can turn left right with the joystick and you can go tell the vehicle to go fast or go slow. It's very intuitive, much like driving a car or driving a boat. SOLOMON:  While Regent seems to be moving along rather quickly, the co- founders say it has an all been smooth sailing. KLINKER:  One of the biggest challenges for building a sea glider is that we are really pushing physics to the max. So, it's really the combination of all these different really advanced technologies that allows us to do this full mission, but it's really a physics challenge for us. THALHEIMER:  I think the other challenge we had was just the fact that this is so new this has not existed before. So, as we've gone out to customers, there's a lot of education we need to do. You know, what is it? How does it work? How is it crude? How is it certified? SOLOMON:  Thalheimer says they have a $7 billion backlog in pre-orders across the airline and fairy industries. As for next steps, Regent is currently building a full-scale prototype and has ambitions for passenger test flights by the end of 2024, and by 2050, they hope to have large capacity sea gliders in operation with ranges up to 800 kilometers. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's story getting a 10 out of 10, sticking with our aviation theme, a record-breaking paper airplane. A team of young Boeing engineers put themselves on the map when they set a new Guinness World Record by folding, then flying a paper airplane that went 290 feet. Holy origami, that star near the length of a football field y'all. It took them minutes to fold the plane just right, making sure to craft it with as much weight as possible, helping them create the greatest amount of momentum after the toss. Speaking of map, dad joke alert, I got an email the other day explaining how to read maps backwards. It was spam. Shout out to Stevens Middle School in Pasco, Washington. We see you. And I'll see all of you tomorrow. I'm Coy Wire and we are CNN 10. END230302

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Happy Friday eve. It's Thursday, March 2nd. I'm Coy Wire and we are so grateful that you're spending part of your day with us right here on CNN 10. Let's start today with the latest reporting on the origins of COVID-19. It's been nearly three years since the pandemic began and we're still trying to figure out answers about how exactly this virus was able to infect so many people and take so many lives.  Reporting this week states that with, quote, low confidence, the U.S. Department of Energy and the director of the FBI endorse a lab leak theory, meaning the virus accidentally escaped from a lab in Wuhan, China. Low confidence according to the office of the director of national intelligence generally means that the information is scant, questionable or very fragmented or that the intelligence community has significant concerns about the sources.  One of the main reasons that there is so much uncertainty about the virus's origins is that China has not been transparent and willing to communicate openly with their knowledge and information.  Now others within the U.S. intelligence community and many scientists maintain however that this virus developed naturally in animals and then started to spread to humans in an outbreak at a market. Republicans in the House of Representatives on a COVID subcommittee are committed to investigating the issue and finding the origin of the virus. Here's CNN chief investigative correspondent Pamela Brown with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAMELA BROWN, CNN CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  More than three years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The theory that the virus originated from a lab in Wuhan, China in the spotlight. The Department of Energy now saying in an updated classified report, that it believes with low confidence that the virus accidentally escaped from a lab, but that theory remains a minority opinion within the U.S. intelligence community. JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  Some elements of the Intelligence Community have reached conclusions on one side, some on the other a number of them have said they just don't have enough information to be sure. BROWN:  Early in the pandemic, many prominent scientists discredited the so-called lab leak theory. One group writing a letter published in The Lancet Medical Journal saying, "We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin."  But other medical professionals have long refused to rule it out. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FORMER FDA COMMISSIONER:  These kinds of lab leaks happen all the time, actually, even here in the United States, we've had mishaps. And in China, the last six known outbreaks of SARS 1 have been out of labs. BROWN:  Even Dr. Anthony Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed it was possible. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, U.S. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLEGERGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES:  It might possibly have been something that Chinese were doing a virus that they isolated in the wild, and we're having it in the lab and then somehow it escaped out. I don't think that happened, but I have an open mind. BROWN:  According to the intelligence community's assessment, first published in 2021, the origins of the virus will remain elusive until China cooperates with global investigations. Why at this point, do you say it's possible maybe even probable that the virus came from a lab and accidentally leaked out? JAMIE METZL, SENIOR FELLOW, ATLANTIC COUNCIL:  The SARS-CoV-2 virus has an ancestral origin and a type of horseshoe bat, that doesn't exist in Wuhan. If this comes from nature, there would have to be some evidence of it coming from nature. Right now, we don't have that evidence. BROWN:  Now, House Republicans are demanding more information from the State Department, FBI and DOE on the origins of COVID-19.  REP. BRAD WENSTRUP (R-OH):  I want to make sure that we are readying ourselves for the next pandemic. If we will and the more we can learn about natural origins and/or possible lab leak, then the better off we're going to be. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: An object traveling at a supersonic speed is traveling faster than -- 200 miles per hour, the speed of light, the speed of sound or the speed of a hedgehog? Here comes the boom, a supersonic object is traveling faster than the speed of sound. Continuing now with our series on the future of travel, we take to the skies where one company says that they'll be able to take passengers in planes that fly twice as fast as commercial planes being used today. And that means getting to where you're going twice as fast.  But here's the thing, you'd have to be willing to break the sound barrier to do so and that means you'd be going so fast that the aircraft would create a sonic boom which according to NASA is as loud as an explosion or thunderclap.  Here's CNN business correspondent Rahel Solomon with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Planes are a ubiquitous mode of transportation today. They've allowed us to link cities, countries and continents like never before. But what if we could fly faster and experience more in a way that's also better for the planet. BLAKE SCHOLL, CEO, BOOM SUPERSONIC:  I believe in a future where more people can go more places more often. I think that life happens in person, that connecting across oceans is incredibly important to our future.  I'm Blake Scholl, founder and CEO at Boom Supersonic.  The last frontier in air travel was more than half a century ago when we went from propeller aircraft into the jet age, and it's been a long time since we had a step forward. I think the next frontier is all about making the planet more accessible, about having flights that are faster, more affordable, more convenient and dramatically more sustainable. SOLOMON:  Just under a decade old, Colorado-based startup Boom is working to bring supersonic travel back to the skies.  SCHOLL:  I started my career as a software engineer, but I've been passionate about aviation since I was a kid. And I never understood as a tech guy why everything in our world was getting faster and better but our flights weren't. SOLOMON:  Commercial supersonic air travel was first realized in the 1970s when Concord took flight. But after just 27 years, the fleet was retired due to a number of issues, including noise, expensive overhead and cost prohibitive tickets.  SCHOLL:  The supersonic airplane fundamentally is about being able to go very efficiently at very high speed.  SOLOMON:  Supersonic means flying faster than the speed of sound.  According to NASA, typical speeds for these aircraft range from about 1,200 kilometers per hour to about 2,400.  These speeds are achievable through powerful engines and a long lean fuselage design. The downside, supersonic travel creates a shock wave or sonic boom that is loud and disruptive over land, which is why it's only intended for long hauls across oceans. SCHOLL:  We're building on a proven foundation and delivering a new capability to passengers. It doesn't require a massive regulatory change or any regulatory change at all. We've now built XB-1 which is history's first independently developed supersonic jet, and it's going to be in the air here in the next few months, to prove that all of this technology actually works.  SOLOMON:  XB-1 is Boom's prototype of what will be their first airliner Overture according to Scholl. It's expected to be capable of going twice as fast as regular aircraft therefore nearly having transit times. Think San Francisco to Tokyo in six hours or New York to Frankfurt and a little over four.  With orders already placed from U.S. carriers American and United, Boom has a sky-high goal to get Overture into service by 2029. SCHOLL:  On board the airplane, expect a large spacious interior and beautiful large windows it's a supersonic airplane actually flies higher you'll be able to see the skies a deeper blue actually see the curvature of the earth. All of that adds up to a machine that can take you across oceans but at roughly the same cost as flying business class today. Ultimately, our goal is to make supersonic flight available to anybody who flies. There are many challenges we still have left to overcome. What we're doing is complex it's safety critical it requires a lot of money. But when I look back to the past, I also see a lot of challenges that we've already overcome. And that gives me encouragement that we will continue to do things that the world says we can't do.  Supersonic flight is about making the planet dramatically more accessible. When that happens, I think we will live in a very different, more peaceful, more harmonious, more collaborative future. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, teamwork makes the dream work for two eagles building. One is in the nest, then another flies in is like, hey, can you help me with this other one's like, what this stick? And it's like, yeah, can you help me put it over there? Sure, no problem. They pick up the branch and mark it over in perfect rhythm. If I give DJ Nader a beat, he can make them dance. Now, keep in mind, these eagles get to get to be about three feet tall so their nests can get to be about six feet wide. That's wider than a queen-  size bed. Well done, my feathery friends. Well, that's about all we have time for today. Thanks to everyone who's reaching out @coywire on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, and thanks to everyone showing love on our CNN YouTube page. Northside High School in Jackson Tennessee, we see you and we are showing love right back at you. Tomorrow's Friday, can't wait. Crush it today and go be awesome. I'm Coy Wire and we are CNN 10.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, lovely people? It's your boy Coy ready to shine bright with you this first Friday of March. Friday's rock. But before we get into the weekend, let's make a strong end to the week. We are fueled up and ready to rock it out with you right here on CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news. We're going to start today with what I call the scroll that squashes your goals, spending too much time on social media. And one social media app TikTok is looking to put a lockdown on all you're looking around on their wildly popular platform. On Wednesday, TikTok announced that users under 18 years of age will have their accounts locked after one hour of screen time on the app each day. In order to continue, users are going to have to enter a password. Now, the company and many experts believe that the feature could improve the digital wellbeing of users by requiring them to actively opt out of a screen time limit. The new initiative will roll out in the coming weeks and it's one of the most aggressive moves yet by a social media company to prevent people from getting caught up in the seemingly endless scrolling that can be really consuming. The move also comes after TikTok, and other social media platform has faced years of scrutiny of their impact on young users. And TikTok specifically is facing mounting pressure from lawmakers, some of whom feel the platform should be banned altogether, due in part to online security concerns. How much time do you spend scrolling each day? We could all probably spend a little less time on social media, while apps like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat can be really powerful tolls to learn, motivate, inspire and connect us with people. Most experts agree that too much screen time can have that effect, especially on young people. More now from CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Everyone knows that screen time probably is a problem for them, whether you're a teenager or an adult. We spent too much time on our phones. And what's amazing is that, you know, look, these phones have not been around that long. So, a lot of people now research and kind of look into how much time are we spending on phones and what can we do about it? Interesting, one piece of data that jumped out at me, the average person will pick up their phone to look at it, just look at it 300-sometimes a day. So, you're just constantly doing this, and breaking that cycle, that initial cycle of, look, I don't even know why I'm picking up my phone, just doing it, I think was a really important thing that came up over and over again. So, Catherine Price who wrote up a book how to break up with your phone, she says ask these three questions every time you pick up your phone. What for? Why now? And what else? What else could I be doing instead? It's just to sort to bring your brain back online for a second so you're not mindlessly starting to look up your phone. I thought that was really interesting, something I've been doing already in my life. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Let's continue now with part four of our series on the future of travel, the next frontier. It's estimated that by the year 2050, the world population could grow from 7.8 billion to nearly 9 billion. Transportation experts are considering how to support the travel needs for that many people. But could the solution for congested cities mean zipping around above the streets? Here's Rahel Solomon with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It's not a plane and it's not a helicopter. But it might just be your aerial ticket to the next frontier of urban transit. This is VoloCity, an all-electric, manned, drone-like aircraft. It looked like something of a sci-fi film, but this high-tech flyer is aiming to take off in the very near future. DIRK HOKE, CEO, VOLOCOPTER:  The next frontier for me is that we will see urban mobility coming to life and we will see vehicles flying, bringing us from A to B, making our life easier and ensuring the smooth end-to-end mobility. My name is Dirk Hoke and I'm the CEO of Volocopter. SOLOMON:  German manufacturer Volocopter has been busy building the flying taxis of the future. HOKE:  I believe in 2050, we will be using mobility air mobility and as a frequent transportation system, as we do today with taxis. SOLOMON:  But Hoke is quick to tell us, they're not trying to disrupt the travel industry. HOKE:  So, it will not be used where you have an already existing tram, or you have a metro. But in any area where you have very high traffic congestions, the VoloCity will add more alternatives and options to your daily journey. SOLOMON:  VoloCity is designed for single passenger intercity transit with define roots, like from the airport to a hub in a city center. The aircraft is classified as eVTOL, or electric vertical take-off and landing. HOKE:  EVTOL means that we use electric motors to lift the vehicle and then to move forward. SOLOMON:  They are pilot controlled, fly at low altitudes and operate like drones. HOKE:  We chose a multicopter design. That means we have 18 motors and rotors, which enables us to fly very stable and fast and safe. SOLOMON:  VoloCity's current range is 35 kilometers and can reach speeds up to 110 kilometers per hour and it's all powered by nine swappable battery packs. HOKE:  We want to be adding a new mobility without adding to the congestion and to the emissions of this world. With that, we decided from the beginning to fly fully electric. SOLOMON:  Beyond last kilometer transit, Volocopter has plans for a larger integrated portfolio, from the booking platform to the landing platform. HOKE:  We also a designed a Volo Region which will be a five-seater connecting regions and cities up to a distance of 200 kilometers. We have also the Volodrone which is intended to carry cargo up to 200 kilo, and this is all managed by our software platform which we call VoloIQ, which is enabling not only to operate these vehicles, but also to maintain the vehicles and, of course, do also the booking and the security check at the Voloport. Voloports are designed to optimize the charging and the handling of the passenger. We are now leaving the prototype status. We're really on a very solid track to go into commercial operation in 2024, in cities like Paris and Rome, because we believe if we can fly in Paris and Rome, we can fly almost anywhere, because it's a very complex, very dense urban environment. SOLOMON:  Volocopter's ultimate goal is autonomous flight. But for now, there are more steps just to get their fleet off the ground. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  There's still the management of airspace, what are the paths, how do we manage, do we have the regulatory space to allow these things to be adopted? And I think that's where you're going to start to see hopefully soon some pretty interesting conversations taking place. SOLOMON:  And perhaps a bigger hurdle, Hoke says public acceptance. HOKE:  I really hope that people will embrace it, I believe it's a very, very nice vision of the future to have quite sustainable air taxis. And we actually believe we will have a big impact on the transportation of the future. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's story getting a 10 out of 10, an unfrogettable riveting story out of Australia, where a man named Dazza created a 3D printed home for a frog he found hanging out in his fence. He started small, but as his TikTok video of the frog get to rack up more than 20 million views, he got some frogsome ideas from viewers. The little pad has progressed into an amphibious mansion, complete with a porch, plants and the garden and an infinity edge waterfall pool. Oh, viewers named the frog Frederick, and the homebuilder says that Frederick has even some friends come over every now and then to visit. Unfrogettable. All right. I want to give a special shout-out to Northwood Middle School in Wakarusa, Indiana. What's up, lovely people? I also want to show some love to my friends at West View Middle School who sent me like all kinds of great letters and cards, uplifting, motivating messages and they also sent me this pretty sweet t-shirt right here. Tighten up, everybody. All right. Let's keep shining. We're CNN 10 on YouTube. Send your shout-out request there. Have an awesome weekend. And remember, you are more powerful than you know. I'm Coy Wire. It's been a blessing to spend this week with you. END230306

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone, it's your boy, Coy. I hope you had a wonderful weekend. I am excited and so grateful to be right here with you today so we can give each other some good vibes. Let's dig in and dig deep if we have to, to start this week strong. Speaking of deep, way beneath the surface of one of the great lakes, researchers discovered a ship that had been missing for 128 years. Officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA solved the mystery in conjunction with the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The Ironton, a 191-foot wooden schooner barge, sank after colliding with another ship in Michigan's Lake Huron in 1894. The other crew survived, but five of the seven crew members of the Ironton did not. The ship was actually first noticed with cutting edge technology back in 2019, and it is in remarkable condition, standing upright with all three masts still intact, thanks in large part to the cold, fresh water of Lake Huron. Officials kept the discovery a secret until all documentation of the wreck was complete. That way, no divers could potentially disturb this piece of history. But now there may soon be federal and state permits allowing divers to go explore what lies deep beneath the surface.  Up next, we have an update on one of our CNN heroes. Every year, our CNN Heroes event honors individuals who create positive change and make extraordinary contributions to humanity. One CNN hero, Teresa Gray, is a nurse from Alaska who takes small teams of volunteer medics to humanitarian crises all around the world through her nonprofit Mobile Medics.  Well, two days after she heard about the tragic 7.8 magnitude earthquake which impacted Turkey and parts of Syria, Teresa was on a plane on her way to Turkey to help. Here's a feature on how Teresa's work in Turkey is helping people recover from a disaster that took the lives of more than 40,000 people in the region. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TERESA GRAY, TOP 10 CNN HEROES:  Hi, Auri (ph), I came to see your leg. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST (voice-over):  Alaska nurse Teresa Gray and her nonprofit, Mobile Medics International, have responded to dozens of humanitarian disasters since 2017, providing free medical care and comfort to more than 30,000 people around the globe.  Last December, she was recognized as one of the year's top ten CNN Heroes. GRAY:  Being named a CNN hero was amazing. It was like the Oscars of humanitarian work. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Please join me in honoring CNN Hero, Teresa Gray.  GRAY:  It got us exposure internationally. It brought in donations, so now we can go where we're needed, when we're needed. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thousands are dead after a powerful earthquake toppled buildings in Turkey and Syria.  COOPER:  So as the devastating impact of this tragic earthquake became clear, Teresa immediately mobilized to head to Turkey. GRAY:  I need some 100cc Syringes. It's pretty frantic leading up to a mission. We like to get in as soon as possible. So we'll be on the ground about 72 hours post-earthquake. OK, so this bag is ready to go. Making sure we have the right equipment, the right medication. We have enough medications and supplies for hundreds of patients. From a trauma dressing to a Band Aid or a Tylenol to antibiotics.  This mission will be completely self-sustaining. The buildings have been substantially damaged, so you can't stay inside. It's too dangerous. So it's wintertime in Turkey. Yesterday it was 5 below. So we're going to be sleeping in a tent, eating MREs.  This is not going to be a good time. I've got eleven sort of dinners and I've only got two breakfast. I get hyper focus. If I get there and I forgot to pack it. You're not running to the story. You need to make sure that you've got everything you need.  We have to be really careful not to cross the border into Syria. When I put a team together, we need to do a zoom call prior to the mission, so we're all sort of on the same page. My goal is to find where we can do the greatest amount of good for the most people in the time that we have.  We need to find a safe place to be. What if somebody forgot their sleeping bag? We don't speak the language, so I need to find some interpreters. So these are the things that run through my mind as I'm getting ready to go to the airport. There's just a whole lot going on. COOPER:  By February 9, just three days after the earthquake, Teresa had landed in Turkey and connected with her team. They soon headed to Hatay Province, to the town of Samandag. GRAY:  This is beyond destruction. This is apocalyptic. COOPER:  They got right to work. GRAY:  I'm here on the streets of Samandag. We're doing mobile clinics. And all the people are living here in these tents now because the buildings are either fallen down or about to fall down, there is no in between. Everything is damaged beyond repair. So we go street to street to street and we stop at these little tent cities. Here is KT (ph), another one of our translators, who's explaining to the group, how we need to do things.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Currently we've got two lines going. People that have got either chronic or acute problems that will be dealt with. GRAY:  We're seeing earthquake injuries, lacerations. Did something fall on him in the earthquake? Yesterday, we saw a child who had been trapped in the rubble from the knee down for well over 12 hours. We're seeing cough, cold, flus from living together. Whatever it is they need us to look at, we will. But this is what we do every day. Then we go back, sleep in our car, get up the next morning and do it again.  COOPER:  They treated hundreds of people during their mission, and their interpreter, KT, became name an essential part of the team. GRAY:  KT is the one who brought us to this neighborhood and showed us where the need was.  KT (ph):  Every sick people we went, they told me, say them, thank you. It's really good for us because we can't go any doctor. We can't see any doctor. We can't go any hospital. COOPER:  And though KT's family had taken refuge in a greenhouse. GRAY:  So 15 people living? KT: Yes. GRAY:  This is where they're going to live for the foreseeable future. COOPER:  They adopted Teresa's group as their own. This is my new Turkish mama. And these people have taken us in and they've allowed us to stay on their properties. And they've given us tea and coffee. Tell her that we are so grateful for her. COOPER:  Another reminder that even in desperate times. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You're welcome. COOPER:  Humanity can shine through. GRAY:  I know, I'm so sorry. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia. Which of the following birds is NOT the name of a major professional sports team? Pelicans, Penguins, Parrots or Ducks? Between the NFL, NBA, NHL, MLS and MLB, not one team is named the Parrots. Today's story getting the 10 out of 10, a pair of parrots pestering players in the middle of a softball game last week.  And we're talking full on invasion here of a college game between Bradley University and Gardner-Webb. Feathers flying, umpires duck in, and as far as feather or not, they found out where they came from. Well, here's CNN's Jeanne Moos with more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  They took the field, causing a flap. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There are multiple parrots on the field. MOOS:  Two, to be exact. Delighting. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just gorgeous birds. MOOS:  And freaking out the women's softball players at the University of Central Florida's field, causing an umpire to duck. (Voice-over):  Rain delay, yes. But parrots delay? CHAD STEARS:  That's absolutely the first. MOOS:  Chad Steers was the home plate umpire when one of the parrots made a home on his shoulder. STEARS:  I felt the wind from the wings and a gasp from the crowd.  MOOS:  Let's go to the replay. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One just landed on the umpires. MOOS:  Chad was so unfaith, he pretended to put on his mask as if to resume the game with a parrot on him. When he tried to touch the bird, the parrot retreated to the other shoulder. Who are these mystery birds? MEGAN BROWN: Tiki is the one who eventually got tired and decided to land on the umpire. Megan Brown owns Tiki and Lelu. She was letting them fly free behind the stadium. They always come back. BROWN:  Hi, baby. MOOS:  During our interview, the parrots dislodged her glasses, attacked the lens and pecked it. BROWN:  Hi, Lelu. MOOS:  And perched on Megan's head. She says she's a little surprised Tiki didn't nip the umpire when he touched him.  But Chad loved Tiki. STEARS:  It was just a great moment. MOOS:  After about half a minute, one of the grounds crew lured the bird to him and escorted Tiki out. The umpire's co-workers teased him. STEARS:  Hey, and this is sitting on my desk, you know. MOOS:  Who cares about calling balls and strikes when you're the target of a bird's strike? (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Apparently, that parrot thought it was landing on the shoulder of an "umparrot." Special shout out today going to Camden, New York. Camden Middle School, we see you. Thanks for subscribing and commenting on our CNN 10 YouTube Channel. Some motivation Monday for you.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. Thank you for spending part of your day with us right here on CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news.  Now we have to start today with some sad and concerning news out of North Korea. Experts say that North Korea's chronic food shortages are growing and so is the number of citizens potentially dying due to starvation. Trade data, satellite images and assessments from the United Nations and South Korea suggest that the nation is grappling with their lowest food supply since the famine of the 1990s, a famine that caused mass starvation, killing hundreds of thousands of people.  Experts say the current food shortage is likely due to complications from the COVID pandemic. Three years of closed borders and strict isolation, as well as floods and storms which offset planting. North Korea is a self- isolated and very secretive country, so it's difficult to assess or prove what's really going on there.  Experts say that equal distribution of any available food there is unlikely because the elite and military are prioritized. Now despite the food shortage which few experts deny, North Korea continues to spend money on missile tests instead of food, and refuses aid from neighboring countries. Here's CNN's Paula Hancocks with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Concerns about North Korea's food crisis are growing. Reports from multiple sources say deaths due to starvation are likely.  LUCAS RENGIFO-KELLER, PETERSON INSTITUTE FOR INT. ECONOMICS:  Probably its worst point since the famine in the 1990s, which killed three to five percent of the population. HANCOCKS:  Attentions are being paid at the very top. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un held a workers party meeting this week, calling for a fundamental change in farming and state economic plans. But many say it is his regime, its chronic mismanagement and isolation that has caused this crisis.  LINA YOON, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH:  We're really talking about three years of no imports of fertilizer. There's been no input of tools or components to fix the outdated machinery that they have. HANCOCKS:  An extensive shutdown of borders due to the COVID pandemic meant almost no food or aid was getting into the country. Only in recent months as minimal trade restarted with China. South Korean officials said last month they believed deaths from starvation are occurring in certain areas, though provided no evidence.  Its rural development agency estimates that the North's food production dropped almost four percent last year from the year before. RENGIFO-KELLER:  Food has dipped below the amount needed to satisfy the minimum human elites. So as it stands by that measure, even if you distributed food perfectly equally which is totally inconceivable, you would have hunger-related deaths. HANCOCKS:  Speaking to South Korea's foreign minister last week, he said Pyongyang has to decide to help its own people. PARK JIN, SOUTH KOREAN FOREIGN MINISTER:  The only way that North Korea can get out of this trouble is to come back to the dialogue table and accept our humanitarian offer to the north and make a better choice for the future. HANCOCKS:  The regime's focus remains on its nuclear and missile program. Seoul's Ministry of Unification says if Pyongyang had used the money spent on launching missiles last year for food, it could have bought one million tons, more than enough to cover the annual food shortage. But that focus is unlikely to shift. YOON:  As the time goes on, the capacity for North Koreans to endure hardship becomes harder and harder, their resilience, you know, runs off and their -- you know, their resources also decrease. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In biology, a complete set of DNA in an organism is called what? Genome, chromosome, genetic code, or interphase? Genome is the term for the entire set of DNA instructions for a cell or organism. Thanks to recent breakthroughs in genetics, scientists say they will soon be able to bring back prehistoric creatures that have been extinct for thousands of years. We could see a woolly mammoth roaming the earth in as little as four years, according to researchers. Now, woolly mammoths were the huge, hairy-looking elephant type beasts marching through the ice age snow about 10,000 years ago. One company, Colossal Biosciences, says it plans to reincarnate the mammoth using gene editing technology, in a process called de-extinction.  And there are other extinct creatures scientists could bring back as well, like the Tasmanian tiger or the dodo bird. But should they?  As you can imagine, there are plenty of ethical questions about these recent genetic advancements. Here's CNN's Rachel crane with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RACHEL CRANE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Your body contains 37.2 trillion cells and within each is a copy of a code consisting of more than twenty thousand genes and billions of strands of DNA. This code is your genome and it determines everything that makes you you.  What if you could modify that code, bring back extinct species, eliminate hereditary diseases? That is precisely what molecular engineers and geneticists around the world are working on. GEORGE CHURCH, GENETICS PREOFESSOR, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL:  Genes are what we get and we're stuck with them and the environment is the only thing we can change and there's kind of a limit to how much you can do. But now, if we can change our genes, too, but really in much closer to total control of our biology and physiology. CRANE:  George Church is one of many, using a revolutionary gene-editing technique called CRISPR-Cas9, which allows you to modify DNA sequences.  CHURCH:  CRISPR is a way that you can design and target a particular part of your genome and change it to something else, or you can delete a gene. You can make all sorts of edits very precisely. CRANE:  CRISPR is kind of like having the fine delete replace function for DNA. No one actually invented the process. It happens naturally.  Scientists discovered that bacteria alter their DNA to defend against viruses, essentially storing part of a virus so they can identify target and attack the virus if it comes back. Researchers realize the tools bacteria use to do this were Cas proteins, nature's genetic scissors. Geneticists are now using these proteins to make their own targeted changes to DNA. Scientists have been messing with genomes for years. So what's the big deal with CRISPR? CHURCH:  This is dramatically different. I mean, it's like 10,000 times easier. This can be used in agriculture, where you can change any plant or animal, can be used to eliminate invasive species. What's most exciting about CRISPR is our ability to alter long-standing epidemics like malaria and HIV. CRANE:  And that could potentially save millions of lives. CHURCH:  So here we grow human cells, elephant cells. We can do cloning procedures. CRANE:  It turns out that you can make pretty pretties by tweaking small strands of DNA, by making changes to the DNA of the Asian elephant, researchers in Church's lab are working to bring the woolly mammoth back to life. CHURCH:  The difference between a woolly mammoth and Asian elephant is actually quite subtle at the DNA level. CRANE:  What am I going to see a woolly mammoth in Jurassic park? JOE GETSY, RESEARCH FELLOW, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL:  Right. So an actual full woolly mammoth I think is still a few years down the road. We can just change one gene and then the next gene and then soon we have thousands of genes that are changed. The elephant cell will have the exact same DNA sequence as the woolly mammoth cell.  CRANE:  Paint this picture of what the future looks like as a result of CRISPR in your eyes? GETSY:  I suppose the wildest description would be that you have some 150- year-old people that look like their 20-year-old riding on a mammoth. Is that why wild? CRANE:  But CRISPR is not without controversy. If you can make a mammoth, consider what you can do with a person's DNA? For the first time, scientists in China use CRISPER to edit the genomes of human embryos.  People fear CRISPR could lead to designer babies. How do we prevent that from happening? CHURCH:  We shouldn't be playing. We should be engineering and I think that's what we are doing.  CRANE:  Where do you think the moral and ethical boundary is? CHURCH:  Safety. I think safety is number one, just like any new technology or new drug, we should try to make it as safe as possible. If we don't do anything, then people are definitely going to die of malaria next year. A lot of people are going to die of HIV if we don't do something.  If we focus on why it's useful, then that changes the conversation to, you know, what's the alternative? (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, ice cream lovers that'll not be denied their treats, this Dairy Queen in Moorhead, Minnesota, opens every year on March 1st, no matter what the weather is. And if you've ever been to Minnesota in March, it is not warm and toasty.  These faithful fans lining up on opening day, all bundled up, ready to dominate some Dairy Queen blizzards in all sorts of snow. Ice cream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream no matter what the weather. My favorite flavor is Oreo. Well, at least for now. What's yours? I want to give a special shout out to Springdale Middle School in Springdale, Arkansas, rise up. Also for all the students out there, get you some teacher time this Tuesday. Go on and dap up your teacher, give them a handshake or high five, let them know you appreciate them.  See you tomorrow, everyone. I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10. END230308

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Hope you're off to a great day so far. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, and it's #yourword Wednesday. So, follow me at Coy Wire on Insta, Snapchat, and TikTok, and put your challenge words in the comments section of my most recent post. And we'll try to work one, fun one into tomorrow's show. Now, we start today with the back-to-back winter storms in California's mountain communities that have trapped people in their homes with intense snow for nearly two weeks. Now, the Sierra Nevada region already saw 38 inches over a 24 hour period, and now there's another round of snow headed that way. And many people in the San Bernardino Mountains are getting desperate, unable to leave their homes as their food and medicine supplies are starting to run out. Driveways are blocked. Cars are buried under piles of snow as high as a second story window. But even if they could leave, many businesses, including grocery stores, have been forced to close. Let's hear now from CNN National Correspondent Camila Bernal, who's in California as the state braces for even more snow and people grow even more concerned. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Residents here are still frustrated and so upset just because of how long this entire process is taking. There are people here that have been at their homes for more than 10 days without being able to leave, without access to food, a grocery store, a pharmacy. Here behind me is the only grocery store in town. And the roof collapsed because there was so much snow accumulated at the top of the grocery store that it no longer is open. And so people have to rely on donations. This community is coming together. As you can see here behind me, they brought firewood. And the problem is that I talked to other people who have told me, look, I can't even turn on my fireplace because there is so much snow. So, the ones that can, they are here trying to get anything they can to make their lives a little bit easier. I've talked to people who are stuck higher up in the mountains who tell me look, I cannot even make it to the places where they're giving out these donations. And so that frustration just accumulates day after day after day. Authority is saying they are making progress. They say that so far, they've been able to essentially clear about 85% of the roads in this area. The problem is there's a lot of side streets that are still blocked off because of the snow and many of the residents telling me that that is why they can't leave their homes. They're wanting for this entire process to move a little bit faster. But as of now, authorities are saying that they have to wait. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up Next TikTok could soon be banned in the United States along with other social media apps deemed as security threats by lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats have united and voiced their concerns about foreign owned apps like TikTok. And on Tuesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee unveiled a bipartisan Senate bill that would give President Biden the ability to ban them. Politicians and cybersecurity experts have said that foreign technology coming into America, if not regulated, could be used to spy on Americans or take data from them. Or it could be used as a tool to promote certain ideologies. In other words, it could be used to program our minds. CNN Technology Reporter Brian Fung tells us about the potential impact of this bill. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN FUNG, CNN TECHNOLOGY REPORTER:  This bill could lead to a national ban of TikTok. And it's important to point out here that this legislation is still in its very early stages, but the -- it would give the authority to the Commerce Department to take steps including up to and including a ban of TikTok. The bill doesn't specifically target TikTok, but rather kind of talks about an overall category of technologies that might be deemed to be national security risks, whether that's TikTok or Huawei or other companies that might raise national security concerns. The whole intent behind this bill, according to Senator Warner, is to prevent a so-called whackable situation where the government has to come up with new legal authorities or new bills designed to target individual companies. And this would just give them, you know, a bigger, more flexible tool. TikTok has acknowledged that the trust issue with policymakers is real and that it's going to take time to address that. And it's also said that the ultimate goal is to have U.S. user data only be accessible by TikTok's U.S. employees. Now, TikTok's CEO spoke yesterday at a Harvard Business Review conference, and here's a little bit more of what he said. SHOU ZAPORIZHZHIA CHEW, TIKTOK CEO: I think the first thing I would say is that we take these concerns extremely seriously. The Chinese government has actually never asked us for U.S. user data. And we've said this on the record, that even if we were asked for that, we will not provide that. FUNG: Now, we're seeing here that TikTok CEO is saying, look, it's going to take time to, you know, gain trust with policymakers. We're taking these voluntary steps to improve our security and safeguards. But on the other hand, you have lawmakers like Senator Warner who say, you know, we need action right now. And so, what we're seeing here is this mismatch, this contrast between TikTok on the one hand, you know, saying, let's take some time here, and lawmakers who want to really take some action right this moment. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second Trivia. What TV cartoon premiered in 1962 and featured a futuristic family traveling in flying cars? The Flintstones, The Jeffersons, The Jetsons, or the Brady Bunch? Said to have been set 100 years after its premiere, The Jetsons featured a high-tech family flying in the year 2062. Shows like The Jetsons or movies like Back to the Future make viewers ponder what technology might look like in the future. But here in the year 2023, we're less than 40 years away from that imagined future of The Jetsons.  And at the rate technology advances these days, futuristic worlds actually seem to be just around the corner. So how far away are we from being able to zip up and over traffic jam streets? From being able to hover around a city from rooftop to rooftop? We'll hear from a tech expert who tells us what's holding us back and what such a futuristic city of travel might look like. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY WHITE, TECH WRITER, SPEAKER AND CONSULTANT:  We've been chasing the stream of flying cars since The Jetsons. And Sci-fi has led us to believe that we're going to be having these vehicles, but it's really not the case. eVTOL stands for Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing. It is a vehicle, electrically powered, that can lift off the ground vertically, then go forwards to a certain destination, and then land vertically as well. And there are a number of companies at advanced stages of creating these vehicles, but we're somewhere away yet. There are a number of ways that these eVTOLs could be piloted. Most of the ways at the moment seem to be focusing on having an actual pilot, a human, at the helm. So, they have to be certified. They have to be made legal. They have to obviously have the regulations and how they would fly, where they would fly, who's going to be in charge, who's going to be responsible, whether the vehicles are going to be safe or not. And this is what's holding these vehicles back. It's an interesting question, talking about how eVTOLs will fit into the cityscape, because cities are already very crowded, and so where will you use them? Most people right now are saying they're going to operate as a taxi service. So going from existing heliports and then off to heliport, say, at the airport, so utilizing the existing infrastructure in cities in order to make these things work. So, there you've got some pinch points too, because those infrastructure points are already being used by helicopters and other aircraft. And so you've got to actually fit in with those. You've got to fit in with their flight plans, and also then you've got to work out how to charge them. And no one's got to that point yet. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, we are just over a week away from St. Patrick's Day, so today's 10 out of 10 story is very fitting. A woman from Wisconsin might be the luckiest person in the world, setting the new Guinness World Record for the largest collection of four-leaf clovers. Gabriella Gerhardt started hunting four leaf clovers all the way back in the year 2010. She now has more than 119,000 of them, that's 7000 more than the previous record FYI. Now, learning about this story got me thinking. What's so lucky about this leaf? According to Celtic tradition, four-leaf clovers have magical powers of protection and are able to ward off evil and bad luck. But it's not clear to historians where the idea began. OK, remember to send all those #yourword Wednesday submissions had so many good ones last time. We want to give a special shout out to Laconia Middle School in Laconia, New Hampshire, rise up and thanks for subscribing to our CNN 10 YouTube Channel. Also today, March 8, is International Women's Day. So special shout out to all the inspiring, uplifting and awesome women in our lives. Much love and many blessings. I'm Coy Wire and we are CNN 10.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, hello. It is Thursday, so happy Friday Eve. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. If you're having a good week, keep it going. If you're having a rough week, keep going. Remember, the strongest steel has burned in the hottest coals, and our tough times can make us tougher. Thank you for spending part of your day with us. Let's get you to the news of the day. Thousands of government delegates across China are gathering for the nation's biggest annual political meeting, known as the "Two Sessions." Two parties in China gathering separately for meetings, but at the same time, one is the National People's Congress, which is the supreme state authority for China's communist government. The other is the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which is an advisory group without real legislative power. Thousands of delegates come to Beijing during this period. And traditionally, media, which is usually allowed to attend, gets the rare opportunity to speak with normally elusive government delegates. But even though China lifted its zero COVID policy and media is allowed to attend again this year, delegates weren't very gregarious. In fact, most media were still denied close access to them. CNN International's Selina Wang was there, giving us a rare look at the Two Sessions and showing us just how shut out reporters are, those state medias telling a different story about the access reporters were getting. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Thousands of government delegates across China are gathering for the biggest annual political meeting known as the Two Sessions. It's the first since China abandoned its zero COVID policy. But reporters covering the event are still stuck in a COVID bubble, required to stay overnight at a quarantine hotel and get an onsite PCR test. (On camera):  We just left the Quarantine Hotel. We're now headed to the venue. Everything is highly controlled. (Voice-over):  The foreign media bus gets dropped off at Tiananmen Square. (On camera):  It is very rare for journalists to get access to this. As you can see, though, there's heavy security. There are guards everywhere. Normally, the Two Sessions is the rare chance for media to get up and close to China's top leadership. Right here on the steps of the Great Hall of the People, this is normally where you will see media trying to doorstop the top leadership. But as you can see, this year we, the media, were completely separate from the rest of the leaders. (Voice-over):  The Two Sessions is a carefully choreographed event. The new government shakeups that the rubber stamp parliament will vote on have one unifying goal, to strengthen Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party's Power. And the COVID restrictions are the perfect tool for Beijing to control the message. (On camera):  So, media has to apply to get access to specific events. We're not granted approval to all of them. And this is a media area inside the Great Hall of the People. As you can see, it's pretty empty, so it's clearly not an issue of capacity. (Voice-over):  Some of the events during the weeklong meeting allow select reporter questions, including Qin Gang's first press conference as China's new Foreign Minister. He said that conflict with the U.S. Is inevitable if Washington does not change course. Qin Gang called Washington's approach a reckless gamble, accused the U.S. of creating a crisis over Taiwan, defended China's partnership with Russia as imperative, and said it has not supplied weapons to Russia or Ukraine. Meanwhile, Chinese state media is portraying the legislative meeting as an open event where journalists can freely operate. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Sri Lanka. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm from Luke News (ph). It's an amazing country. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The assemblies also offered journalists the opportunity to put questions to the Chinese premier and ministers. WANG:  But under these controls, spontaneous run-ins with top leaders like the premier and ministers are out of reach. But after today's meeting ended, we had a few minutes to approach some delegates, which are a curated group of local representatives. This delegate is part of the Zhuang ethnic group from the southwestern Guangxi province. She says, this is her first time attending the Congress and she feels happy to see her motherland becoming stronger. The rest of the delegates quickly rush out before we have a chance to approach them. The question is, how much of these COVID controls will remain in post pandemic China? It limits access even more to China's already extremely opaque political machine. This much is clear, the communist leadership only wants the world to see one narrative from China, that is the image of unity, strength and victory. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia. Which of these holds the current title of planet at the most moons? Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, or Venus? To date, astronomers have identified 92 moons orbiting Jupiter, giving it the top spot. And it is one of those moons, specifically that scientists are getting ready to explore more. Why? Because they think that there may be life there. The name of the moon is Europa. And it's already been discovered that just beneath Europa's icy surface there's an ocean. In fact, it was the first ocean ever discovered on another celestial body. Let's learn more about the probes that NASA and the European Space Agency are sending to Jupiter and its moons and what they might find. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Jupiter has three moons with oceans underneath their icy shells. They're called Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa. Earthlings have been curious about these moons and their potential to house life for a long time. NASA first sent probes in part to get a closer look in 1977. Jupiter is a gas giant. That means it doesn't have a surface. It's a swirl of gases that can dense into a smoldering ocean of hydrogen at its core. It's very similar to our sun in this way. But unlike the sun, it doesn't fuse hydrogen atoms into helium to create energy and heat. Now back to those first NASA probes, they observed long lines and dark spots on the moon Europa. Typically, moons have cratered surfaces. But these images tipped scientists off that there might be an ocean beneath Europa's icy exterior. In 1996, that theory was confirmed when the Galileo spacecraft reached Europa. It was the first ocean discovered on another planet. Then, in 2012 and 2016, the Hubble Space Telescope showed water plumes erupting from the warmest parts of Europa. Scientists don't know much about the plumes. But if Europa has water and elements like carbon and hydrogen, it could mean that microbial life once formed there or even still exists. Armed with that possibility, the European Space Agency and NASA are sending probes deep into our solar system to look specifically at Jupiter's icy moons. First is the Jupiter icy moons explorer or JUICE from the ESA. JUICE is traveling to the Jupiter system armed with the latest technology to take photos, observe the magnetic field of Jupiter and take readings of what is beneath the icy crusts of Jupiter's large moons. Later, NASA will send the Europa Clipper to fly by its namesake over 40 times to sniff its atmosphere. It will gather material from the plumes for the first time. And that will give scientists a better idea if Europa's oceans could support life. The missions will gather data. They will also aim to gather insights into fundamental questions about our universe. Is there life beyond Earth? What might that look like? And what does that mean for the future of humanity? (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's story, getting a 10 out of 10 Jupiter and one of its planetary pals giving us a constellation prize. Last Wednesday, in a phenomenon known as conjunction, Jupiter and Venus appeared to nearly kiss in the nighttime sky at their closest from a stargazer's perspective, they were just one degree apart. But they weren't actually close. They were still about 400 million miles apart. That's more than four times the distance between us and the sun. Jupiter and Venus are the two brightest celestial bodies in the nighttime sky after the Moon, though, so this was still pretty awesome to see. We are giving a special shoutout to Crook County Middle School in Prineville, Oregon today. We see you. Thanks to everyone who subscribed and commented on our CNN 10 YouTube Channel for a shoutout. I also want to show some love to @Mr.Gio Meany (ph), who won the #Your Word Wednesday submission.  The word I used today was gregarious, an adjective used to describe someone who is sociable.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Happy Monday and welcome back. If you're still waking up, stretching and yawning because daylight savings stole an hour of your sleep, I feel you. But I'm going to jab back at that sleepy voice in my head because somebody has to dominate this day, so why not us?  I'm Coy Wire. Thankful to be here to start this week strong with you right here on CNN 10. Parts of California faced persistent flooding over the weekend after rounds of deadly storms. 34 of California's 58 counties have been under a state of emergency issued by the governor's office due to the storms. And there's still a threat of more severe weather this week. More than 41,000 homes and businesses across the state were without power this weekend, and about 15 million people throughout the state were under flood watches, including parts of northwest Nevada.  Local emergency crews are having to rescue people from their homes. Roads have been washed away. Bridges have collapsed. The impacts from this week's storms have only compounded problems created in some areas by the severe rain and snowfall over the past two weeks.  President Biden approved a state of emergency declaration for California to help aid the millions of residents affected who are being urged to stay clear of waterways and avoid all unnecessary travel.  Here's CNN National Correspondent Nick Watt with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK WATT, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Water, everywhere, causing chaos across central California. Some 25 million are under flood warnings. The Kern River usually runs at about six feet, it's up over 17th. Snow is the issue up at altitude. In SoCal, they're rushing to rebuild some sort of road for 450 households. This is their only way out. Springville's Pleasant Valley Road now anything bad. In my 40 years, never seen it like that, to the man who shot these images. A major artery in Oakland closed at rush hour nearby a peach coffee warehouse roof collapsed, killing one. Around 25 times the volume of water that flows in the Mississippi is flowing through the air and this is the 10th so-called atmospheric river to hit California this winter. Low pressure from the north meets moist air near Hawaii. They call it a Pineapple Express, sounds fun? It's not. Essentially a fire hose aimed at this state usually famed for its sunshine. Throw in a couple of other winter storms that dumped a couple of years' worth of snow on some upland areas. And this is the result. Today's storm is a warm one. So along with all this rain, some of that snow is melting. The residents of Felton flooded in January once more told to evacuate, here and elsewhere yet more upheaval. ALISA, NEWMAN, CALIFORNIA: Now, we have to go home, pack our stuff and leave once again when we were just able to come back a couple of weeks ago. WATT: Good news, all the water this winter is significantly rolling back. The years long drought suffered in the West. Bad news yet another atmospheric river's forecast to hit this state early next week. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia. Which of these European cities is known as the city of light? Madrid, Paris, Rome or London? It's been called the capital of fashion and the city of love, but Paris is also well known as the city of light.  And up next, we're traveling to France where over 1 million people have been protesting against the government's plans to raise the retirement age for most workers in the country from the age of 62 to 64.  The protests have happened in major French cities and the impact has been felt across the country. It's brought many transportation services to a standstill. Trains shut down, flights canceled, old schools and businesses, closed, as trash piles up on streets.  Even the Eiffel Tower was closed to visitors. The French government has said that raising the retirement age is necessary to keep their pension system viable. All French retirees receive a pension from the government on average around $1,500 a month.  But this planned reform angers workers at a time when living costs, food costs and energy bills are rising in France and elsewhere. Many of the protesters are young people, some who haven't even entered the workforce yet, they say, though, that for a generation already concerned about inflation and job prospects, the government moving the finish line on retirement is depressing. We'll hear now from CNN's Jim Bittermann from the streets of Paris. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): French President Emmanuel Macron, like his predecessors, has run into fierce opposition from the streets trying to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Strikes are growing by transportation, energy and even garbage workers.  (On camera): In a country where the average life expectancy has now increased to the age of 82 years old, it seems reasonable to expect that with France's pay as you go retirement system that, in fact, the retirement age would have to increase as well.  After all, as it stands now, if you retire at 62, it means collecting pension benefits for, on average, 20 years. And the money has got to come from somewhere. (Voice-over): But it's not that reasonable to everyone.  TAYEB KHOUIRA, SUD UNION SPOKESPERSON (through translator): We are going on an unlimited renewable strike as long as this reform has not been withdrawn. BITTERMANN: Economists here will explain that while people are not especially happy with the present system, any further meddling with it is viewed with suspicion and anger.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, up next, we are traveling to the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom, where they have some of the rarest animals on the planet. They've welcomed the birth of the endangered Malayan tapir, three of the threatened fossa pups, triplets they had, and the world's rarest chimp, the critically endangered Western chimpanzee. This zoo's mission is to prevent animal extinction through conservation. Let's hear more about this zoo's 10-year plan in the next episode of CNN Series Call to Earth. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The small northern English city of Chester might seem like an unlikely place to find some of the world's most endangered animals. But since the 1930s, Chester Zoo has grown a reputation as one of the best in the world for conservation, with a targeted aim of preventing species extinction.  MARK BRAYSHAW, CURATOR OF MAMMALS, CHESTER ZOO:  There's a huge biodiversity crisis at the moment. I mean, losing species at a phenomenal rate. And some of these species, we're not even aware of them. We don't know their sort of role. And so, you know, by taking species out here, now we don't know the long-term impact on that.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  While the gold standard for Chester Zoo is to breed species to reintroduce to their natural habitat, in many cases now the urgent focus is on creating a safety net population in captivity. BRAYSHAW: Almost into the zoo action as an arc. And we might be in a situation where actually a species habitat is gone. They're not going to go back into their natural habitats. We had to sort of look at other places we could put them back into, balancing up, you know, any sort of impact that might have. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Luckily for the preservation of some of these critically endangered species, the zoo is in the midst of a baby boom. A birth for the world's rarest chimpanzee, triplets for the Madagascar fossa, a greater one-horned rhino, a Malayan tapir, and finally, an addition to the zoos family of Marsupials. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Morning Kitawa (ph). UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Increased mining and deforestation in Papua New Guinea have seen the wild population of Goodfellow's tree-kangaroo more than halved over the past 30 years. So the birth of a new joey in Chester provides a glimmer of hope for the future of the species. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's story, getting a 10 out of 10, the family whose house was mistaken for Spiderman for decades, hundreds of letters have been sent to 20 Ingram Street in Queens, New York, addressed to Peter Parker, aka, spiderman.  The address appeared in a comic book in 1989. And it just so happens that the real-life family who lived there is the Parker family. They thought they were being pranked at first, receiving letters from kids all over the world, telling Spiderman how awesome he is.  Now, these superhero letters are now on display at the City Reliquary Museum in New York City, showing hope, optimism and belief in a better tomorrow. Now, your letters make us feel super. Thanks to the Senior Government class at Cascade High School in Montana, inspiring us to keep working to create a better tomorrow.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, all you lovely, smart people. Welcome to March 14, the birthday of one of the smartest people to ever live, physicist Albert Einstein, born in 1879. And everybody knows that Albert Einstein was a genius. His brother there, Frank, though, was a real monster. Hey, you. I joked to the start your Tuesday off right. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, and we've got a big show today, and we start with the collapse of a bank in the United States over the weekend that has people worried about losing their money and businesses on the verge of going under. Silicon Valley Bank, an epicenter for tech startup companies with $175 billion in deposits at the end of 2022, has collapsed. One reason, those rapidly rising interest rates we've been talking so much about on this show. Well, they made the Treasuries, in which the bank had invested money, less valuable. So, the bank started to sell them at a loss, and that scared people who had money there. So, they went on what's called a bank run, withdrawing all their money in a panic. The more people that did that, the more others wanted to do the same. Inevitably, the bank collapsed. The FDIC, or Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, seized control of the bank, and President Biden said yesterday that all depositors would get their money back. And businesses that kept assets there, well, they would have money to pay their employees. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank had a ripple effect on a second bank. The same sort of bank run hit Signature Bank shortly after it had its doors slammed shut, as regulators warned that keeping it open could threaten the entire financial system's stability. Now, there are fears that other banks may be next. There's a term for this sort of spread of fear over people losing money when banks collapse. It's called contagion. So yesterday morning, President Biden addressed the nation for the first time publicly to try to ease those fears, knowing that the panic could cause a devastating economic fallout for people and businesses around the world. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT: All customers who had to pay deposits in these banks can rest assured, I want to rest assured, they'll be protected, and they'll have access to their money as of today. That includes small businesses across the country that bank there and need to make payroll, pay their bills, and stay open for business. No losses will be -- and this is an important point, no losses will be borne by the taxpayers. Let me repeat that. No losses will be borne by the taxpayers. Instead, the money will come from the fees that banks pay into the deposit insurance fund. Because of the actions of that -- because of the actions that our regulators already taken, every American should feel confident that their deposits will be there if and when they need them. Second, the management of these banks will be fired if the bank is taken over by FDIC; the people running the bank should not work there anymore. Third, investors in the banks will not be protected. They knowingly took a risk, and when the risk didn't pay off, investors lose their money. That's how capitalism works. And fourth, there are important questions of how these banks got into the circumstance in the first place. We must get the full accounting of what happened and why those responsible can be held accountable. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Up next, an update on the intense flooding in California. A levee or a barrier designed to stop the flow of water was breached in California's Pajaro River this week and the river overflowed out of control towards the people and homes nearby. One of the worst levee failures was in New Orleans, Louisiana in 2005. It led to 80% of the flooding in the city during hurricane Katrina. CNN Correspondent Mike Valerio was in Pajero during the evacuations. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIKE VALERIO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Warnings of intense sustained flooding in the days ahead after California's latest atmospheric river compromised part of a critical levee, sending this rushing river into homes, farms and trapping families in the small community of Pajaro. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We really didn't expect it to happen, but here we are now. JOSE PERE, RESIDENT, PAJARO, CALIFORNIA:  They started evacuating, I would think at 12 in the morning or 1 in the morning.  And they just started. The national guards are just taking people out as they go. VALERIO:  Officials say an 11th atmospheric river system, forecast for Monday could send more water rushing through the still breached levee. CAPT. CURTIS RHODES, PIO, CAL FIRE:  There could be more water in our backdrop, but there will also be more water throughout the county. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Coming down. There you go. Just keep this line. VALERIO:  The raging floodwaters leading to a dramatic aerial rescue captured above the Salinas River. California highway patrol saving a man stranded on an island after floodwaters swept him and his car into the river. The man brought to dry land unharmed. SHERIFF TINA NIETO, MONTEREY COUNTY, CA:  Folks, we are not done yet. We are dealing with rain and wind events that I can only describe as a super, super saturation event. VALERIO:  But an undeniable sense of flood fatigue creeping in even as officials issued new evacuation orders for more communities near the Salinas River and back in hard hit Pajero, community supervisor Luis Alejo told us there's a sense of vulnerability both about the future of Pajaro and its mostly migrant families. LUIS ALEJO, COMMUNITY SUPERVISOR:  This community is resilient, it's strong. When these waters received Pajaro is going to rise. This is such a great hardship on this community, but we know that we will get through this. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia. With an atomic number of 11, which of these elements gets its symbol from the Latin word "natrium"? Nickel, Sodium, Sulfur or Nitrogen? If you missed this, don't be salty. With a symbol of Na, sodium is the correct answer here. Now, some creatures, like ocean animals, thrive in salt, but that could just be because pepper water would make them sneeze. Anyways, the World Health Organization is calling for us humans to cut back on the salt. They want salty food consumption to be monitored not only by individuals, but they're also calling on countries to implement policies that would set limits on the amount of salt in foods being served in public places like schools. Now, if you love French fries like me, you may just find this insulting. More now from CNN Health Reporter Jacqueline Howard. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER:  The World Health Organization wants people to cut back on salt. And we know that eating too much salt is one of the top risk factors for heart disease, stroke, and death. And the World Health Organization says that only nine countries have what they're calling a comprehensive package of policies to reduce sodium intake. Those countries are Brazil, Chile, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and Uruguay. And examples of these policies are reformulating foods, so they contain less salt or setting limits on foods high in salt being served at public places like hospitals or schools. And the WHO is now calling on all countries to implement sodium reduction policies. It says doing that could save an estimated 7 million lives globally by 2030. And it's considering extending its 30% target to 2030. And right now, Dr. Francesco Branca with the WHO says people living in high income countries consume a good amount of salt in one snack. DR. FRANCESCO BRANCA, WHO DIR., DEPARTMENT OF NUTRITION FOR HEALTH:  Just to give you an example, if you take an average bag of chips of 150 grams, only that bag of chips contains half of the salt we are supposed to consume every day. HOWARD:  And in the meantime, though, there are steps you can take personally to watch how much salt you eat. The WHO says, to cut back on salty sauces and condiments, avoid snacks that are high in salt. And when using canned or dried products, choose varieties without added salt and sugars. It's recommended to limit your salt intake to less than 5 grams per day. That's just one teaspoon. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And In today's story, getting a 10 out of 10 is "sawsome." Some artists use a paintbrush, some use a pencil or chisel. But Glenn Richardson uses a chainsaw, baby. Richardson has carved chainsaw portraits of people since 2016. Now he's traveling the country in a yellow bus, making 19 stops along the way, carving people's portrait into wood, and then putting the finishing touches on. Look at that blowtorch. His goal is to hear people's stories and share them with others in hopes of bringing people together. Can you believe it only takes him about 17 minutes to create one of these. He starts on the East Coast in May and believes he can reach the Pacific Coast by October. That's tremendous. Now, don't get all sappy on me, but I'd carve each and every one of you out of wood if I could. But I'm not too experienced with carving. I only know a little. Now, on to my favorite part of the day. I want to give a special shout out to. Byers Middle School in Denver, Colorado. We see you. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10.

Like Mr. Sliz (ph) at Pine Valley Central School in South Dayton, New York, who I met recently. All of you, keep uplifting guiding and inspiring, helping us make sense of this world in which we live.  Students, go on and give your teachers some heart hands today and let them know you appreciate them for being the best that they can be for you. Now, we start today with news from the Black Sea, where a Russian fighter jet forced down a U.S. Air Force drone this week after damaging the propeller. The U.S. drone and two Russian aircraft were flying over the Black Sea when one of the Russian jets intentionally flew in front of and dumped fuel on the unmanned American drone several times. According to U.S. officials, the Russian aircraft then hit the propeller of the drone, prompting U.S. forces to bring the drone down to the water. The incident marks the first time Russian and U.S. military aircraft have come into direct physical contact since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine just over a year ago. And the incident this week is likely to increase tensions between the two nations. The U.S. called Russia's actions reckless, environmentally unsound, and unprofessional. But the Russian Ministry of Defense denies that the Russian jet made contact with the drone at all. This is a potentially dangerous escalation at a critical time in the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine. We'll hear now from CNN Pentagon Correspondent Oren Lieberman, who has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  All of this plays out early Tuesday morning in international airspace over the Black Sea when the U.S. says its MQ-9 Reaper drone was intercepted by two Russian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jets. That part is not that uncommon, and these sorts of intercepts have happened in the past. What is extremely rare is what happened as this played out. Over the course of 30 to 40 minutes. The Russian fighter jets, according to the Pentagon, repeatedly flew around and in front of the U.S. drone, dumped jet fuel in front of it, and even collided with it, damaging the propeller and forcing the U.S. to take down its own drone in international waters in the Black Sea. Now, the National Security Council's Coordinator for Strategic communications, John Kirby, told CNN that the U.S. took steps to protect its equities, but it's unclear exactly what that is, whether that was some sort of self-destruct or some other step to protect it.  Now, the drone has not been recovered, partially because at least there is no U.S. naval asset in the Black Sea to have carried out such a recovery. So the U.S. took some step to protect its own equities. This MQ-9 Reaper drone. But again, unclear what that is. Much of the response so far has been in the diplomatic lane. The U.S. summoning the Russian Ambassador to the U.S. and carrying out at least a 30 minutes conversation at the State Department.  Russia giving an entirely different version of events, saying there was no collision, there was no Russian jets firing at that U.S. drone, but Russia saying it does not want confrontations. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia.  Which of these U.S. states is nicknamed the Gem State? Oregon, Idaho, Arkansas, or Delaware? Idaho. The Gem State is the 14th largest, and it's bordered by Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, Washington and Oregon. We'll travel to Oregon now where some residents are pushing to move the state line so that they can join their neighboring state of Idaho. The movement known as Move Oregon's Border for a Greater Idaho is looking to redraw the border between Oregon and Idaho so that about 20 rural conservative Oregon counties can instead become part of Idaho. These counties say that they want to do this because they want a Republican led government. Oregon's state government is currently controlled by Democrats, while Idaho's state government is controlled by Republicans.  Critics of the idea have called the plan bad for America and have stated that the U.S. political system works best when there's a balance of different viewpoints. But members of the group pushing for change have said rural Oregon is politically outnumbered in its state and that their voices have been ignored for years.  The group believes their livelihoods, industries and freedoms are hurt by the policies of a government that doesn't share their values. Still, those opposed to the idea believe dividing America into politically like-minded people is the opposite of a healthy country.  We'll hear now from CNN National Correspondent Kyung Lah looking at both sides of this debate. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SANDIE GILSON, GREATER IDAHO MOVEMENT:  It's extremely frustrating. The rules and regulations that they're making that make sense in the city don't make sense out here. KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Out here in eastern Oregon, the expansive rural region and Sandie Gilson's home where we're walking is a world away from the urban cities of the state. (On camera):  Do you have anything in common with Portland? GILSON:  Oh, sure, we're all people.  LAH (voice-over):  But she says that's about it. And the signs dotting the east tell you what many people here want known as the Greater Idaho Movement. Redraw the state line so liberal Portland and the other democratic cities are Oregon. And eastern Oregon overwhelmingly Republican joins largely conservative Idaho. Nearly all of Oregon's 17 eastern county governments have approved plans to leave and form a larger Idaho resembling the logo on Sandie Gilson's hat.  (On camera): Is this about politics or differences? GILSON:  Both. We are very different people. I don't believe that the Oregon government as a whole and the supermajority that has been in power there for many decades is listening to eastern Oregon at all.  BARBARA EHARDT, IDAHO STATE HOUSE: It just overwhelmingly hit me this makes sense. LAH:  So much so that Idaho State Representative Barbara Ehardt, a Republican, co-sponsored a bill to begin dialogue with Oregon. EHARDT:  This is where all the big decisions are made for the Idaho legislature. LAH:  The bill passed the Idaho House and is now before the Senate. Idaho's government is officially on a path to redraw its state line for the first time since 1864. EHARDT:  The country is so torn apart right now. LAH:  By ideology? EHARDT:  Yes. LAH:  Is this your vision of peace? EHARDT:  It is one of the solutions, yes. ILANA RUBEL, IDAHO STATE HOUSE:  Are we going to carve Georgia out of Atlanta? Are we going to carve Austin out of Texas? Are we going to slice Michigan's? It's a ridiculous road to start to go down.  LAH:  State Representative Ilana Rubel knows all about being a political minority. She's a Democrat in Ruby Ridge, Idaho and voted against the state bill. (On camera):  Are you surprised that it has already gotten this far?  RUBEL:  I'm saddened, but I'm not surprised. We are in a time, I think, of unprecedented partisanship and hostility. GILSON:  Portland's changed. Salem's changed. Eugene has changed. LAH:  What do you say when the people of those cities say that they're changing with the times and that's the America of today. GILSON:  They say it's more progressive to have government tell you what to do. But the people here haven't changed. LAH:  If these two states do agree to redraw the state lines, then Congress has to get involved and Congress has to approve this entire measure. But how would this work if they do, do all of this? This is Oregon on that side of the river, that is Idaho. Oregon, where I am standing, would become Idaho. Just like 250 miles to my north, to the west and to the south. It would form one of the largest states in the entire country, a new Idaho. Organizers say it would be approximately the size of Montana. (END VIDEOTAPE)  WIRE:  I love shoes. So if you're a sneakerhead like I am, we might be soul mates.  And you're going to love today's story, getting a 10 out of 10, an exorbitant price tag for some shoes. A pair of Air Jordan 13s are expected to shatter auction records with a high estimate of $4 million.  Worn by the legend Michael Jordan himself in the 1998 NBA Finals, the last championship series, by the way, he won with the Chicago Bulls. The current record is another pair of Jordan's game worn shoes which went for 1.47 million 2 years ago.  Open bidding is set to take place online starting April 3. Shulala weh weh. Those are sweet. All right. So many great. Your word Wednesday submissions yesterday on my @coywire social accounts. Thanks to today's winner @Brady E. Ellison (ph) for exorbitant. Did you hear it? It's an adjective meaning unreasonably high when talking about a price or amount charged. Our special shout out today is going to Redwood Collegiate Academy in Ukiah, California. Big love for the third biggest state in America. Do you remember which state is the largest in the country? It was on yesterday's show. I'll ask somebody. See you tomorrow, lovely people.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, lovely people. It's Friday, March 17, St. Patrick's Day. So happy St. Patrick's Day, y'all. The weekend is upon us, and we have had an awesome week. So let's lock in and finish this week strong. We start with a trip to Japan today, where the number of births last year dropped to a record low.  This population decline is a trend for the island nation that experts are worried about. Deaths have outpaced births for more than a decade, so Japan now has a huge elderly population and a shrinking workforce. There's no population to fund pensions and health care as demand from the aging population rises, Japan's Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, warned citizens that the country is on the brink of not being able to maintain social functions.  A government agency was even set up to focus on this issue. One reason for the population loss is Japan's high cost of living. There is also limited space in the cities and a lack of childcare support, which makes it challenging to raise children in Japan.  Let's learn more and head to one rural town where more than half of the village is over the age of 65. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Just after sunrise in the Japanese countryside, no alarm clock needed. The Yokobori family feeds their flock of chickens, feeding themselves freshly laid eggs.  French toast for breakfast, bread baked on a wood burning stove. Wood they chopped from cedar forests surrounding their home. Ten years ago, Miho was an office worker in Tokyo. Today, she's a homemaker. Former graphic designer Hirohito (ph) now a woodworker. The couple runs a small bed and breakfast. For them, city life lost its luster in 2011. A new life in the mountains of Nara Prefecture. Their home miles from the nearest train station. Around here, you need a car to get around. (On camera):  It's so beautiful. But you're so far away from all of the 24/7 convenience of Japanese city life. (Voice-over):  They move to Kawakami Village, a tiny township tucked way on windy roads, the trees taller than most buildings. When the young couple got to know their neighbors, they got quite a shock. (On camera):  Did you guys know before moving out here that the average age was as old as it is? MIHO YOKOBORI, KAWAKAMI VILLAGE RESIDENT:  No. RIPLEY:  You didn't know? (Voice-over):  The mayor tells me more than half the village is over 65.  TADAAKI KURIYAMA, KAWAKAMI VILLAGE MAYOR (through translator):  40 years ago, the population was around 6000. Today it's 1156. RIPLEY (voice-over):  The village population plunging faster than anywhere else in Japan. Some say it's in danger of disappearing for good as people pass away, abandoned homes sit empty. Others sit underwater. Casualties of a dam and reservoir finished a decade ago. (On camera):  When you see the prediction of, you know, under 300 people living here 20 years from now, how do you -- what do you do as mayor to try to stop that from happening?  KURIYAMA:  I'm not optimistic, but I don't think it will be that bad. I believe that people should live in such a nice place. RIPLEY:  The population data is dire, and not just in Kawakami Village. Nearly every local government in Japan predicts a lower population and higher average age by 2045. Entire villages on the verge of extinction. Japanese society is shrinking and aging so fast its future survival is at stake. I'm going to one of the few places in Japan with population growth. You can probably guess where it is. (On camera):  For decades, Japanese young people have been fleeing their small rural towns, lured by the draw of big cities like Tokyo and Osaka, all of them connected by the bullet train. (Voice-over):  But there's no magic bullet for Japan's population problems. Even in Tokyo, the towers are high. Birth rates hit record lows. Japan's population plummeting for more than five years. If the trend continues, experts fear it will fall past the point of no return.  (On camera):  Why are so few women in Japan having children? YUKA OKADA, DOCTOR (through translation):  People usually, for now, don't have the money. RIPLEY:  Is life here in Tokyo too busy for a lot of people to find a partner? OKADA:  Working not in the office, at home, so it's very difficult to meet other people. RIPLEY:  It sounds like there's a lot of lonely people in this big, massive city. OKADA:  Yeah, so -- I think so, too. RIPLEY:  New parents in Japan already get a baby bonus thousands of dollars to cover medical costs.  For singles, a state sponsored dating service powered by artificial intelligence.  So far, boosting Japan's birth rate has been a losing battle. The Yoko Boris (ph) are doing their part. (On camera):  So when he was born, he was the first child in this village in how many years? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  25 years. RIPLEY:  25 years. (On camera):  Also a big challenge raising a child in the mountains, no neighborhood kids to play with. Just six children in his kindergarten class 30 minutes away. The nearest high school more than 2 hours away. MIHO YOKOBORI, KAWAKAMI VILLAGE RESIDENT:  We'll do the best we can, but the rest is up to Kintaro (ph). RIPLEY:  Both say it's OK if their son decides to leave someday. Population data does show more young people moving to the countryside, lured by the low cost of living, clean air, and low stress lifestyle.  The key question, is Japan doing enough to pull up its plunging population before it's too late? (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia. What planet as closest to Earth when it passes by? Mercury, Venus, Mars or Jupiter? It might not be the closest on average, but Venus's orbit brings it closer to Earth than any other planet. Up next, an out of this world story where, for the first time, scientists discovered evidence of recent volcanic activity on Venus. A closer look at archival radar images taken by NASA's Magellan spacecraft in the early 1990s revealed the new evidence on the surface of the planet.  But the new analysis shows that a region near Venus' equator grew over an 8th month span. And experts say this is geological evidence of volcanic activity. The Magellan mission ended in 1994. But NASA has new missions to Venus planned within a decade. Scientists are excited about what else they might discover about this enigmatic, rocky, potentially lava flowing planet. For today's story, getting a 10 out of 10, we're soaring to new heights.  Luke Czepiela attempting a world record, becoming the first to land a plane on top of Dubai's famed Burj Al-Arab hotel. It's actually a helipad, just 88 feet long, but Luke nails it. This is 56 stories above the ground. The red bull air race champ makes it look easy. But he's preparing since 2021, completing over 650 flight test landings on ground level.  So greatness does not come easy. The habits you're creating right now are creating the future you. This reminds me of a fable I heard. The great artist Picasso was walking down the street and he heard a young person yelling, "Picasso, Picasso, you're my favorite artist. Can you can you sign this napkin for me?" Picasso go makes a breathtaking piece of art. "Picasso, this is so beautiful. It only took you 5 seconds to do this." "My child," Picasso said, "It took me 20 years to be able to do this for you in 5 seconds." Master your craft, practice and outwork everyone every single day. Shout out to Carlson High School in Gibraltar, Michigan. Today from me and my CNN team, have a wonderful weekend, everyone. I'm Coy Wire and it's been a blessing to spend this week with. END230320

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. I'm Coy Wire. Hope you had a wonderful weekend. I am grateful to be right here with you to help jumpstart your week for the best ten minutes in news right here on CNN 10. Let's start today with an update on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  The International Criminal Court issued a war crimes arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday. This for an alleged scheme to deport thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia. Now, Russia called the actions outrageous and unacceptable and said the court's decisions are null and void in their country.  Like the U.S., China and other nations, Russia isn't a member of the court, so they don't recognize its jurisdiction. So the chances of Putin actually being in a courtroom over this seem slim to none. Putin and any other official would have to be arrested outside of Russia or handed over.  And if you think justice in general moves slowly, experts say international justice barely moves at all. But anyone accused of a crime in the jurisdiction of the court can be tried, even presidents. The court tries people, not countries, and focuses on those who hold the most responsibility.  That being said, this court is meant as a, "last resort," and it's not meant to replace any country's justice system. The White House has said that it welcomed accountability for perpetrators of war crimes, but stopped short of a full endorsement. And the U.S. also said they will continue to help Ukraine document Moscow's misdeeds.  Ten-second Trivia. Which of these terms refers to the red, green, and brown marine algae growing along seashores? Coral, Anemones, Seaweed, or Seagrass? Normally anchored to the sea floor seaweed can also be found floating on the ocean surface.  There's been a growing threat to tourism in the Caribbean in recent years. And now parts of Florida could be next. Seaweed is overwhelming normally beautiful beaches. A 5000 miles wide mass of seaweed is headed for Florida right now. That's twice as wide as the entire U.S. And it can smell like rotten eggs or sulfur when it washes ashore. For years, it's been wreaking havoc in the Caribbean and on some beaches around Cancun in Mexico. And it's getting worse.  Experts say one potential cause is agricultural runoff. Fertilizers, for example, for crops that wash into rivers and then eventually out to sea. Workers at some resorts are having to fill up dump trucks every day and haul mounds of the algae away. But it's relentless frustrating tourists in places where tourism is the heartbeat of the economy. Here's more now from our friend Leyla Santiago, our correspondent who's on the story in Florida.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOE KAPLAN, KEY WEST RESIDENT:  It's thick in the summertime, builds up and smells terrible.  LEYLA SANTIAGO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Joe Kaplan captured these images about a week ago. Massive amounts of seaweed washing up at Smathers Beach, a beach he knows well because he walks it several times a week.  KAPLAN:  I was shocked when I saw it that day where it wasn't even spring yet. It's still winter, which is very unusual.  CHUANMIN HU, USF COLLEGE OF MARINE SCIENCE:  And this is about a 5000 miles long.  SANTIAGO:  Professor Chuanmin, who is one of the leading experts on what many have referred to as a massive blob of seaweed heading to Florida's coast. (On camera):  Fair to call it a blob?  HU:  No. SANTIAGO:  No, we can't call it a blob, OK. HU:  I would never call that a blob. OK. SANTIAGO:  OK, why?  HU:  Because it's not.  SANTIAGO:  Satellite images, he says, show it's not one massive body of seaweed, rather a bunch of patchy clumps traveling from west Africa. It's called the Atlantic Sargassum Belt and is considered a natural phenomenon. Right now, it's twice the width of the U.S. carrying 6 million tons of seaweed and headed to the east coast.  HU:  In June of this year, it may turn into 20 million tons.  SANTIAGO:  So let me get this straight, this, what we're seeing the last month is 6 million tons and it's going to get bigger? HU:  Yes. There's no way to stop that. This is nature, just like no one can stop a hurricane.  SANTIAGO:  Should we be worried about that?  HU:  Nope.  SANTIAGO:  Why?  HU:  Reason is sargassum is not toxic. SANTIAGO:  But it smells pretty bad and it's a nuisance for those trying to keep beaches clean to attract tourists. Just a few years ago, here's what it looked like in Mexico, officials in Monroe county, which includes the Florida Keys, have set aside more than $200,000 to clean and remove sargassum from its beaches.  CAPTAIN DAN MATTHEWS, MISS CHIEF FISHING CHARTER:  Seaweed is a mixed blessing. We need it. Seaweed is a nursery for all these large pelagic fish. The negative side to that seaweed is if it comes in the concentrations that are believed, we're going to see our fishing grounds are going to be completely covered with it. There's almost no point to fishing because we're going to be spending the entire day cleaning weed off our lines.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Did you know that as of last summer, half of young adults ages 18 to 29 have roommates that are named mom and dad? Millions of young adults are living with their parents, and that's the most since the great depression. Some choose to live with their parents to save money and build for their futures. But many don't have a choice. The cost of housing is rising. Student loan debt is piling. So here's CNN's Correspondent Gabe Cohen who's been speaking to people across the country who are living at home after college.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GRACE LEMIRE, LIVES WITH PARENTS:  Yeah, it feels like home.  GABE COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Grace Lemire shows us her Massachusetts home.  LEMIRE:  So this is my childhood bedroom. COHEN:  Well, her parents' home. LEMIRE:  This is my mom's office.  COHEN:  The 24-year-old moved back after college and hasn't left, even though she's now making close to six figures running her own content marketing business.  LEMIRE:  I mean, it's been huge. I've been able to completely save an emergency fund. I have been able to put a lot of money onto my student loans. I have a bigger down payment for a future home. Those are things that are important to me and make living at home make more sense for me.  COHEN:  She posts about it on TikTok. LEMIRE:  But have you seen the rent prices out there?  COHEN:  And she's not alone.  JORDAN HOWLETT, LIVES WITH PARENTS:  Living by yourself is almost impossible.  COHEN:  Millions of young adults moved home during the pandemic, and many haven't left.  EMILY STONE, LIVES WITH PARENTS:  It's something that I used to be almost like, embarrassed or ashamed of, but not anymore.  COHEN:  As of last summer, 50% of adults 18 to 29 years old were living with their parents, according to Pew, down just slightly from 52% at the peak of the pandemic, the most since the Great Depression.  LEMIRE:  I would say most of my friends are actually living at home with their parents.  COHEN:  Housing costs are a key reason. The average rent nationwide, nearly $2,000 is 26% higher than at the start of COVID and only rising amid this high inflation.  CHRISTINE BRUNIK, LIVES WITH PARENTS:  I can't be financially stable if I want to go out and live on my own.  COHEN:  23-year-old Christine Brunilk has lived with her parents in a Minnesota suburb since finishing college. Renting her own place, she says, could cost half her marketing salary.  BRUNIK:  I feel kind of, like in a stagnant position.  COHEN (on camera):  What's your plan as of now? BRUNIK:  I'm hoping to move out in August, but again, that depends if I find roommates. COHEN:  Then there's student loan debt.  JON WILLIAMS, LIVES WITH PARENTS:  The goal is to just clear that out as quickly as I can.  COHEN:  26-year-old Jon Williams, a pharmacist in Michigan, moved into his parents basement after finishing grad school with $180,000 of student debt, he says.  WILLIAMS:  It has been a very minimalist lifestyle. I've saved over 80% of my net income.  COHEN:  When do you think you'll be able to clear your student debt?  WILLIAMS:  Probably late fall. I'm about three quarters of the way through it right now.  COHEN:  Are you getting antsy?  WILLIAMS:  I am getting slightly antsy. I do feel like 2023 would probably be a good year for me to move out.  COHEN:  Many Americans don't like this trend, 36% say that more young adults living with parents is bad for society, while 6% say it's good. According to Pew Research. LEMIRE:  I've been called a fraud and a freeloader.  COHEN:  Grace's mom had a different take.  NANCY LEMIRE, GRACE'S MOTHER:  If she's in a better position, then that gives us peace of mind. And when we get older, if we need help, she'll be in a better position to help us, right?  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, let's hang 10 for CNN 10's 10 out of 10 story. Australian surf coach Blake Johnston broke the world record for longest surf session. He did it on Friday, surfing 40 straight hours in Sydney, Australia, breaking the previous record by about 10 hours. Stung by jellyfish thinking about potential shark attacks, he rode more than 600 waves for nearly two whole days. Think about how scary it must have been at nighttime.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, and you are awesome. We have a great show for you today, so let's get to it. We're going to begin with the latest news on the protests in Israel. For the past 11 weeks on Saturday nights, protesters have taken to the streets in Israel to call for a government overhaul. Roughly half a million Israelis each week voicing their opposition to the government. That's 5% of the total population.  Protesters are angry at the government's plans to overhaul the country's judicial system, which would give Israeli's parliament the power to overrule Supreme Court decisions. Critics accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of pushing the legislation in order to get out of a corruption trial that he is currently facing.  But Netanyahu denies that, saying that the trials are collapsing on their own and that the government overhaul is necessary. On Monday, though, Netanyahu announced a key change to part of his plans due to the massive public protests and international pressure.  The concession would give Israeli governments less power to select new judges, but still more power than it has now. About 66% of Israelis believe the Supreme Court should have the power to strike down laws incompatible with Israeli's basic laws. And about the same proportion, 63% say they support the current system of nominating judges. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST:  As surely as night follows day, Saturday night these past eleven weeks in Israel has meant mass demonstrations against the government's judicial overhaul. Protesters are concerned it will remove pretty much all checks and balances on the government, allowing it to appoint allies as top judges and removing the Supreme Court's ability to strike down laws except in very narrow circumstances.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who leads the most right wing and religiously conservative government in Israel's history, says his overhaul is required to restore the balance between the government and the judiciary. But the protesters don't buy it. They worry it will rode Israel's claim to be a liberal democracy and that will damage the economy and infringe upon their freedoms of expression, worship, and the right to demonstrate.  President Isaac Herzog's attempts to broker compromise unveiled earlier this week were rejected by the government. And though his warnings of civil war seem far-fetched for now, so long as the overhaul continues its passage through parliament, the protest will continue.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Now for another installment of our CNN series, Call to Earth. We're traveling to Sydney, Australia, where one organization called Living Seawalls is changing the way we think about building infrastructure in the ocean. Experts are engineering seawalls to create critical habitats that are more hospitable to marine life that grows there. We're going to hear from marine experts who believe it's just as important to save the little creatures in the ocean as it is the big ones.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. ARIA LEE, LIVING SEAWALL PROJECT MANAGER:  I started getting into marine science when I was in my twenty s and was doing a lot of scuba diving. I was really interested in the tiny critters that were living in the marine environment. There's a lot of attention with biodiversity and conservation around the large fish like the sharks and the whales. But you have to remember that these organisms rely on smaller organisms in order to survive. We really need to start at the bottom and build up a really strong base on which to build up this food web. My name is Dr. Aria Lee and I'm the project manager for Living Seawall.  The problem in urbanized areas such as Sydney Harbor is that so much of the shoreline has been built over with artificial structures. Over 50% of the shoreline in Sydney Harbor has some sort of structure built upon it, whether it be a seawall, wharf or pontoon. And these artificial structures have taken away the sort of microhabitats like rock pools, crevices, tiny holes that you would see on a natural rocky shoreline.  So what Living Seawalls is doing is bringing back these natural habitat features to an artificial structure such as a sea wall. We, as marine ecologists went out and identified features of a natural shoreline that are missing from a flat featureless seawall. And we've translated that onto a Living Seawalls panel.  The panels are designed digitally and then a prototype is 3D printed. There are currently 14 Living Seawall sites around Sydney and around the entire world. We've installed over 1000 Living Seawalls habitat panels. We can certainly see the difference that the living SeaWorld panels make. The textures can provide seaweed a really strong hold onto the surface.  And that's extremely valuable for all the marine organisms that rely on the kelp, not just for protection and for homes, but as a food source. When there is a new construction, we want the designers to think about how they can design the structure to benefit both humans and the natural environment.  Right now, seawalls are really only useful for humans. They stop erosion. They protect the property that's behind it. What we want to do in the future is think about what the marine environment needs as well as what humans need, and that way we can build more sustainably for the future.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second Trivia. The childhood home of which fictional character was located at 4 Private Drive? Sherlock Holmes, Charlie Brown, Harry Potter or Katniss Everdeen? Set mostly in a fictional Britain, Harry Potter lived at his muggle home at 4 Privet Drive.  And for today's story, getting a 10 out of 10. We're traveling far from the British movie studios that produce the wonderful world of Harry Potter to Japan, where fans will be able to immerse themselves in some of the series most iconic moments at our parent company's, Warner Bros Studio Tour Tokyo, the Making of Harry Potter. Did you know the Harry Potter book series has sold a record half a billion copies, and it's been translated into at least 88 different languages.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Harry Potter's magic --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You're a wizard, Harry. STEWART:  -- is transporting to Tokyo. It's on this massive lot where fans will see some of the series most iconic sets, like the Great Hall at Hogwarts and the Forbidden Forest. It's part of the new Warner Bros Studio, soon to open in Japan.  (On camera):  What goes through your mind when you -- when you see the train, you see the sets, you see the costumes? JEFF NAGLER, PRESIDENT, WARNER BROTHERS WORLDWIDE STUDIO OPERATIONS:  Wow, I can't believe it. And when I come here, I have to remember that I'm here on a business trip and not to be looking at this as if I'm just a fan.  STEWART:  Jeff Nagler is President of Warner Brothers Worldwide studio operations.  (On camera):  Why Japan?  NAGLER:  I think that was one of the easiest decisions for us, actually, because of the whole global interest in Harry Potter after the United States and after the U.K., Japan is the third best area for Harry Potter fandom.  STEWART:  The Tokyo studio is modeled after the one in London and will be larger, a big draw, the Hogwarts Express train that was made in London, transported by land and by sea to its new home here in Japan.  (On camera):  It's not just about the sets, it's about the accessories, the costumes, the props, like the ones you've seen in the movies.  NOZOMI ANDO, TOU GUIDE (through translator):  We normally don't get to see what goes on behind the scenes in movies, but here we get to see how films get made. For example, it shows us how the people who work in the costume, props, movie set departments all work as a team.  STEWART:  Music a glimpse into movie magic far from Harry Potter's roots in the U.K.  (On camera):  Do you see Asia as a growth market for experiences like this?  NAGLER:  Absolutely. We do look at China and we look at Japan. We look at South Korea. We have a big fan base in Australia and New Zealand as well. All of that's not Asia, it's the whole Asia Pacific region.  STEWART:  Stories of imagination appealing to audiences around the world.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  That's all we have time for, for now. Wherever you go today, be awesome.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Wonderful Wednesday to you. It's #Yourwordwednesday. Follow me at Coy Wire on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, and put your unique vocabulary word in the comment section of my most recent post. And we'll choose one, fun one to work into tomorrow's show.  Last week word from @Brady E. Ellison was exorbitant, meaning unreasonably high price.  We're starting out today with news out of Los Angeles, where half a million students can't go to school because of a worker strike. The union, representing school custodians, cafeteria workers, bus drivers, and other support staff, is forcing the nation's second largest district to be shut down. Teachers are also participating in a strike this week in solidarity, and here's what the union wants, equitable wage increases, more full-time work, respectful treatment, and increased staffing. The union workers have an average salary of $25,000 a year, and most work part time, which has led to staffing shortages, according to the union. The cost of living in L.A. is relatively high now. The superintendent of the school district says they've tried to negotiate in good faith, but California law prevents the school system from putting itself in a position that could lead to bankruptcy. And if they gave in to all the demands of the union, well, they say, that's exactly where they'd be.  While some argue that the school workers strike this week would negatively impact students, the district is trying to offset that by offering help to families, by opening 24 grab and go food sites, having 154 schools provide student supervision, plus about 120 city run sites at libraries, recreation centers, and other locations.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  More than half a million kids will not be going to school today. The second largest district in the nation, more than a thousand schools in all, shut down by this strike, called by the union that reps the bus drivers, cafeteria workers, special ed assistants, and custodians. Like Jose Tovar, whose current wage puts him below the poverty line.  JOSE TOVAR, CUSTODIAN:  We're asking for the world, but they live above water.  MAX ARI, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SEI LOCAL 99:  One in three of our members is either homeless or has been houseless while working for LAUSD.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Their union is demanding large pay hikes, more full- time jobs, more staff, and, "respectful treatment." Some parents are sympathetic.  JENNA SCHWARTZ, PARENT:  We have some of our most underpaid workers doing some of the most challenging jobs on our campuses. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The district made an offer, including a pay rise, but only half the 30% demanded.  ALBERTO M. CARVALHO, SUPERINTENDENT, LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT:  Under California law, we cannot drive the school system into a bankruptcy position. And if we were to acquiesce to all of the demands, that is exactly where we would be. That is not legally allowable.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So half a million kids don't go to school while the adults argue.  MIKE BER, PARENT:  I support my kids, and ultimately, I feel that they're probably being left behind in a battle between, you know, adults.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Apparently, it's gotten ugly. The district calls this strike illegal, claiming it's all about the money, not the other stuff.  CARVALHO:  We have not been presented with compelling evidence that there's widespread abuses. Are there issues? Yes. Each one of them is vigorously investigated, and consequences are applied.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  During the strike, there will be some childcare provided at a few schools and parks and box lunches for the many who rely on free school meals.  The union claims 96% of its 30,000 or so members who work in the district voted for this, a strike scheduled to last three days. So barring any breakthroughs, there's no school until Friday.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia.  Which of these insects belongs to the genus Bombus?  Beetle, Butterfly, Bumblebee, or Bookworm? Times up, bumblebees, if you please, belong to the genus Bombus.  Some folks may think bees just randomly fly around feeding on flowers, pushing around pollen, and then hang out in the hives making honey. Turns out these insects are organized, smart and coachable. A recent study shows that bees can be trained to solve puzzles, and other bees can study a demonstrator bee to then accurately solve the puzzle themselves.  No wonder bees are able to divvy out responsibilities in hives with specific jobs and roles to strategically live their daily lives. Let's learn more now how for bees, teamwork makes the dream work.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Check this out, these bumblebees learned how to solve a puzzle. Then they taught their friends how to do it. The prize sugar. Researchers studied bumblebee colonies to see if they developed social learning, also known as learned behavior.  Scientists designed a two-option puzzle box that could be opened by pushing a red tab clockwise or a blue tab counterclockwise. One set of bees, called the demonstrator bees, were trained to use the blue or red tab. Other observer bees watched, and when it was their turn, most bees chose the same option they had observed from the trained bee. One professor said, our research shows, however, that new innovations can spread like social media memes through insect colonies, indicating that they can respond to wholly new environmental challenges much faster than by evolutionary changes. The researchers concluded that bees, like humans, are capable of culture by socially learning behavior.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story tallying a 10 out of 10 is a tale about tater tots. Now, don't get me wrong, it's super important to eat mostly fruits and vegetables and minimally processed, healthy foods that are good for our body and mind. When I played in the NFL, my motto was eat for purpose, not pleasure. But all of us, pro athlete or not, we have to eat some treat foods every now and then, right? Tater tots were invented back in 1953 in Oregon as a way to keep potato scraps from going to waste.  Let's go be spectators in Portland. Now, to learn more about the history of the tot and to see some wild and tasty tater creations.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDREA DAMEWOOD, PORTALND MERCURY, FOOD WRITER AND RESTAURANT CRITIC:  The food scene in Portland is really eclectic right now. When you're able to walk into a restaurant and see like, they're doing what now with tots, I got to try that.  One of the things that we do best is feel good, exciting, high low junk food. It's always going to be an element of Portland, and people love to eat that stuff. I mean, who doesn't want tots with mac and cheese and fried chicken on it?  If you can think about the cuisine, we have a tot for it. So there's Oaks Bottom, which coined the term totcho. That obviously has a Mexican bent to it. There's Japanese restaurant Boxer Ramen, and they do an okonomiyaki tot that is savory and is served with bonito flakes, which are fish flakes that kind of dance in the heat.  There's Korean tots, Cajun tots, Greek tots. I'm starting to feel like Bubba in Forrest Gump talking about shrimp. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp.  DAMEWOOD:  We basically have all of the tots. Tater tots were invented in Oregon in the 1950s, and that was the Ore-Ida company. And they took a look at a lot of potato scraps that they had and said, here's a way to monetize them. And so they formed them into these tots and they're now the tots we know and love today. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Heartbreak Hotel, we wrapped the bacon.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thanks, look at that.  DAMEWOOD:  In its own way, it's kind of a version of eating locals still in, like, a very hilarious frozen food way. Because Ore-Ida is an Oregon company.  ANTHONY BROWN, NACHEAUX, OWNER AND FLAVOR MASTER: Well, tater tot is very versatile. So I was thinking, how do I make this dish tater tots? House made sauce. How do you elevate tater tots? We'll do tot tacos as more and more people are doing things with tots I feel like the bar went from here to up here. So I feel like I need to, you know, just to stay relevant and make sure that we're still crushing it.  DAMEWOOD:  I think most people who come to Portland are into food. Pound of tots, grilled onions, bacon and cheddar cheese with a fried egg on top, brunch in a bowl. This is a place where if you like to eat and you also want to be able to walk it off in between meals, this is it. This is the spot.  (END VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Coy? WIRE:  Oh, sorry, Jeremy. I was in deep time (ph). I want to thank everyone for commending my dad jokes and asking me to do more of them. I don't always tell dad jokes, but when I do he laughs.  And now, special shout out going to Utah today. Kanab High School in Kanab. We see you, Ta. Did you know that Utah's nicknamed the Beehive State, coming from the belief that each person works together to support one another. You better believe we appreciate you. Much love and many blessings.  I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10. END230323

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Hope you're having a great week. But for those of us who are having a tough one, they're unavoidable, they happen. Remember, tough times make us tougher. So just smell the flowers and cool the soup and know that you will be OK. It's Thursday. Happy Friday Eve. Welcome to CNN 10. I'm Coy Wire. Let's start with the latest on Ukraine as the country continues to fight Russia's invasion, the United States and other countries around the world are sending weapons to Ukraine to help them defend their homeland. The State Department said on Monday that the U.S. will send Ukraine $350 million in weapons and equipment. The latest aid includes rockets, fuel tanker trucks, and riverboats. The U.S. will also deploy its Abrams tanks, which has advanced capabilities and speed. And did you know that at Fort Sill in Oklahoma, the U.S. has been instructing top Ukrainians on U.S. weapons systems. So, they'll be prepared to use the equipment and training in the conflict? The Ukrainian soldiers apparently picked up the material so quickly that they were given more instruction than originally planned the individuals training in the U.S. were handpicked by Ukrainian military leaders. This comes amid concerns from the United States and its allies that China may plan to send lethal aid to Russia, though China denied it earlier this month. CNN White House Reporter Natasha Bertrand traveled to Oklahoma to see the training taking place at Fort Sill. So, let's hear more about what she's learned. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: The United States fast tracking key weapons for Ukraine's fight against Russia heavy U.S. tanks now set to be deployed to the country faster than originally planned. BRIG. GEN. PATRICK RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: DoD, in close coordination with Ukraine, has made the decision to provide the M1A1 variant of the Abrams tank which will enable us to significantly expedite delivery timelines and deliver this important capability to Ukraine by the fall of this year. BERTRAND: Patriot missile defense systems also due to arrive in Ukraine in the coming weeks, defense officials told CNN much sooner than anticipated. REAR ADMIRAL JOHN KIRBY, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR: They're wrapping up training on things like the Patriot air defense system. I mean, we're doing everything we can to make sure that they're ready as best they can be for these critical weeks and months ahead. BERTRAND: CNN was invited to observe the Patriot training here in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where 65 Ukrainian soldiers, ages 19 to 67 have been undergoing an intensive 10-week training course on the Patriot systems. Here you can see behind me a decommissioned system much like the one the Ukrainians will be using once they get back to their home country. BRIG. GEN. SHANE MORGAN, COMMANDING GEN. FIRES CENTER OF EXCELLENCE: Our assessment is that the Ukrainian soldiers are impressive and absolutely a quick study due to their extensive air defense knowledge and experience in a combat zone. It was easier, though never easy, for them to grasp the Patriot system operations and maintenance concepts. BERTRAND: But the stakes are so high that CNN was not allowed to film or photograph the training, an effort to protect the Ukrainians who will be back on the front lines in just a matter of weeks and to shield the U.S. from blowback from Moscow. U.S. officials emphasizing that the Patriots are purely defensive and not a threat to Russia. LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It's a point defense system. It's got to be placed in a location that is defending a target like a capital city, Kyiv or a port city like Odesa. So this is not a weapon system that can be moved around on the battlefield based on changing threats. BERTRAND: The systems will, however, help defend Ukraine against near daily missile barrages by Russia and will now likely be on the battlefield in time to support a looming Ukrainian counter offensive. REP. MIKE QUIGLEY, CO-CHAIR, CONGRESSIONAL UKRAINE CAUCUS: What did Zelenskyy say when I met him in Kyiv? He said, help us win quickly. It's exactly what he said when he visited Washington, D.C. recently. And is even what Secretary Austin said he said Ukraine doesn't have time. This spring offensive is coming. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Researchers at Columbia University set out on a mission to create the perfect cheesecake with 3D printing. Now, this concept of using a machine to make a three-dimensional, tangible, solid object from a digital file has been around for decades. It wasn't until around 2005 that 3D printing started to become more mainstream. Let's see how these scientists fared in their quest to create the perfect cheesecake using a printer. Something tells me that in the future, many of us are going to be reminiscent about the halcyon days when our food was made with a human's touch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. JONATHAN BLUTINGER, CREATIVE MACHINES LAB, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY: The general principle here is as soon as you kind of touch software with an industry, you don't really go back. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jonathan Blutinger and his team at Columbia's Creative Machines Lab attempted over and over and over to make that very satisfying cheesecake using a 3D printer. The results were terrible until they realized cheesecake's creamy, soft texture required some rethinking. To back up, 3D printed food has been around for years. You can find companies working on candies, sugar decorations and pancakes. One California company, Sugar Lab, has treats you can purchase right now for around $20. But at Columbia University, the researchers were dealing with something that's pretty well mushy. BLUTINGER: We didn't really think about the rheology of jelly and banana being so soft and kind of mushy that it kind of just crumbled as soon as the graham cracker paste kind of created a ceiling on top of it. So, it was a -- it was sobering experience. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If they could figure it out, this technology could give cooks greater control over nutrition and calorie counts. And 3D printing cuts down on human handling, which minimizes potential contamination. After a few more tries, they discovered the tricks that worked. BLUTINGER: Then we quickly started to think and try to create little walls and kind of little pockets to hold some of these softer ingredients. We got to a point that was pretty exciting. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The now well-structured cheesecake just needed a finishing touch. In this case, the added flair was one that separates Columbia from their 3D printing counterparts. Blutinger used a touch of laser cooking that toasted the top with exacting precision not found in any other cooking appliance. And the taste? BLUTINGER: Because the ingredients were packed together, you can really taste each ingredient in waves. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Now, it's time for a story that's dyno mite and it's getting today's 10 out of 10. The dad of two fur babies, two dogs played an epic prank on his pups by putting on a puffed-up T. rex costume. And then he prowled around in the backyard. And what ensued was a dorosauruval. Our Jeanne Moos has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT: A mere glimpse of green, some sort of alien being out in the backyard. And these two boxers, brother and sister, go nuts. T. rex taunting them through the glass at their Las Vegas home. (On camera): So, who is in that costume? JANEEN WALSH: Oh, it was my husband. MOOS (voice-over): Janeen Walsh put her husband Andrew up to it. Nico and Stella were wary at first but got bolder and bolder. Janeen could barely stifle her laughter. Jurassic Bark with one commenter, though, in that movie franchise, the dinosaur scared a dog to death. But Nico and Stella were fearless. (On camera): You don't think they smelled your husband and recognized him? WALSH: At first, they didn't. I could tell at first, they had no idea what it was. MOOS (voice-over): These are dogs not afraid to rum with a rumba. WALSH: No. MOOS: Their pursuit of the T. rex lasted about a minute before he went down for the count. MOOS: Janeen says her husband wasn't scared. Andrew has rolled around with the dogs before, minus the dino suit. MOOS: Finally, Janeen stopped laughing long enough to ask. WALSH: Are you OK? MOOS: The boxers didn't bite, but they made holes. WALSH: This is where Nico then decided he wanted to dive inside of it and get my husband. MOOS: At least, unlike the dinosaurs, her husband didn't go extinct. WALSH: Are you alive? (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, everyone. We had so many. great, Your Word Wednesday submissions yesterday. Thanks to today's winners from Mr. Charles (ph) class at Dwight D. Eisenhower in West Berlin, New Jersey.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, hello, hello. We made it. Friday is here. The most wonderful time of the week. And it's been an awesome one. We've had some fun, learned a lot, and I've even got to meet one of you from Booker T. Washington Magnet High School in Montgomery, Alabama. What's up, Asha (ph)? And Dr. Simone Thomas, thanks for making us part of your class each and every day.  All right, we're starting today with the latest news from Capitol Hill, where the CEO of TikTok is facing withering criticism from lawmakers. The app, which has a reported 150 million users in the United States alone, is facing a potential U.S. ban over national security concerns. This stems from the fact that its parent company, ByteDance, is based in China. And on Thursday, some lawmakers made their case at the TikTok congressional hearing.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CATHY M. RODGERS, (R) CHAIR, ENERGY & COMMERCE COMMITTEE:  We do not trust TikTok will ever embrace American values, values for freedom, human rights, and innovation. TikTok has repeatedly chosen the path for more control, more surveillance, and more manipulation. Your platform should be banned.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Now, the CEO, Shou Chew, is pushing back hard, saying the app is not a vehicle for the Chinese government to spy or spread propaganda in the United States, and that its new security model has American users data being stored in America by an American company. Here's part of his testimony yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHOU CHEW, TIKTOK CEO:  The bottom line is this, American data stored on American soil by an American company overseen by American personnel. We call this Initiative Project Texas. That's why Oracle is headquartered. Today, U.S. TikTok data is stored by default in Oracle service only vetted personnel operating in a new company called TikTok. U.S. data security can control access to this data.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Let's go to CNN Business Writer Clare Duffy for more.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER:  Yeah, it does sort of feel like deja vu from 2020. We were having a lot of these same conversations about whether TikTok would be banned in the U.S. except for now it is so much more popular than It was even back then.  LUCY HOCKINGS:  TikTok --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here's what you need to know about TikTok and why there's so much pressure to ban it.  SEN. JOHN THUNE (R) SOUTH DAKOTA:  But I'm particularly concerned about TikTok's connections to the Chinese Communist Party, which repeatedly --  DUFFY:  So, there are range of concerns about TikTok, but the main concern is really rooted in TikTok's connection to China. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance is based in China, and lawmakers are concerned that the Chinese government could use that connection to access U.S. user data.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  TikTok collects a range of data from its users, including users location, IP addresses, what type of device they're using, and even what users are typing on their keyboards. Under Chinese Communist Party laws, the Chinese government can demand TikTok hand over that data.  DUFFY:  And so it's really a range of data, and some of it, you could say, you know, what is the Chinese Communist Party really going to do with what kind of device I'm accessing TikTok on? But I think the concern is that some of that information, like location data, could be used for intelligence operations for certain folks using the app. That's why a lot of state governments have banned government officials from using the app on their phone.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Those concerns aren't without merit. In December of 2022, ByteDance admitted that employees within the company had accessed the personal data of at least two foreign journalists, including information about their location.  OLIVER DOWDEN, CHANCELLOR, THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER:  We are also going to ban the use of TikTok on government devices.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The U.S. government, it's military, multiple state governments, the E.U., U.K and Canada have all restricted the use of TikTok on government devices, citing security concerns.  DUFFY:  There's also a concern that the Chinese government could force TikTok to spread propaganda to U.S. users, and that would affect users much more broadly than just government officials.  VANESSA PAPPAS, TIKTOK'S CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER:  We have never shared data with the Chinese government, correct.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  With the Chinese Communist Party?  PAPPAS:  Yes, correct.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  TikTok's Chief Operating Officer told Congress that the company would not give US. User data to the Chinese government, but avoided saying whether or not its parent company, ByteDance, would do the same.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's not the point. That's not my question. That's not my question. My question is, does any employee who has access to U.S. user data, are they members of the Chinese Communist Party? You won't answer that question? PAPPAS: And again, as a Global Tech --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  China has said numerous times that fears about the government's influence are overblown.  WANG WENBIN, SPOKESPERSON, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY (through translation):  So far, the United States has been able to provide any evidence that TikTok is a national security threat. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In the end, it's pretty safe to say that if TikTok was owned by a U.S.-based company, you wouldn't be hearing anything at all about national security concerns, after all, many apps on your phone are already collecting similar data that TikTok does, including your location.  DUFFY:  It's a question of how much you're comfortable with your data being shared with any app? I think it's a question that people should be asking about all of their app usage, and you should be paying attention to, you know, the settings that you have in your apps. Do you -- how much do you allow your apps to access your location data or your contacts? Are you comfortable with that? I think this is something that people should be thinking about with TikTok, but also beyond TikTok, with all the apps that they use on their phones.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia.  What's the largest country in Western Europe?  The United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, or France?  At over 200,000 square miles, France is about the size of one and a half California's or two Colorado.  We're heading to France now where the country continues to face ongoing protests over the government's plan to overhaul the pension system. The government wants to change the national retirement age from 62 to 64 and the government says the current system is already not economically sustainable and says that citizens are living longer now. So something needs to change.  Here's CNN's Senior International Correspondent Sam Kiley on the ground in Paris with more.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Violent protests, garbage on the streets and two no confidence votes, President Macron's plan to overhaul the French pension system has caused uproar.  But why all the fuss? As France's population ages and the French live longer, the government here says that it can't afford the pension scheme that allows retirement at 62, so it's raising the majority pensionable age to 64. Opponents of the reform argue that the changes will hit blue collar workers because they start work earlier in life and women unfairly.  The opposition has been vocal and strikes have hit across the country since mid-January. Parisian streets have been choked with 10,000 tons of rubbish as a result of a garbage collector's strike. But public transport and even the oil industry have been affected. Aside from the content of the reform, many in France have been upset by the manner in which they've been rammed through without parliamentary support.  Fearing that the law wouldn't secure a majority vote for pension reform in the National Assembly, Macron's Prime Minister invoked a constitutional mechanism that allows the President to force fiscal legislation onto the statute book without a vote, and that sparked nationwide demonstrations and violence in Paris, especially. On Monday, the government survived two national assembly no confidence votes.  The bills are now likely to become law, and Macron faces opposition from the French far right, the far left and a sizable chunk of the center. And the angers against the reforms show no signs of ending and could hobble his second term in the Elysee Palace.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10, it's unbearably cute. How would you like to become a professional bear hugger? Yep, that's right. It's plausible to get paid to give literal bear hugs. The details of New Mexico Department of Game and Fish's job listing for conservation officer includes the willingness to crawl into bear dens and hug baby bears like this one. Look at those cute little paws.  But my question is, wouldn't mama bear be a little upset about this? I'm cool. I'm going to just stick with virtual bear hugs and air hugs to all of you.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. You're off to great places. Today is your day. Your mountain is waiting, so get on your way. Dr. Seuss, y'all got to love it. Today's top story has taken us to Israel. Unprecedented wave of protests and strikes is bringing the country to the brink of a shutdown. For months, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets, protesting changes to Israel's legal system.  But over the weekend, tensions rose higher when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suddenly fired the country's Defense Minister, who'd called for a pause in the government's judicial reform efforts.  The country's proposed overhaul would give Israel's parliament more control over the judiciary, including how judges are selected, what laws the Supreme Court can rule on, and it would also give the power to the government to overturn Supreme Court rulings.  Critics say these changes threaten the country's democracy, removing checks and balances on the government, saying that there is no check on the government's power other than the Supreme Court. Critics worry that if politicians have more control, the rights of minorities in Israel, especially Palestinians, would suffer.  The government maintains that it received a mandate to pass this reform when it was elected last November. And Netanyahu and his supporters argue that they've called for reform because Israel's judiciary has no written constitution, only a set of basic laws making the Supreme Court too powerful.  They also say the Supreme Court doesn't represent the Israeli people and that it has overstepped its bounds on certain issues. Protest, organizers said that they would continue to intensify demonstrations until the legislation was halted and seemingly in an effort to bring down tensions, a deal to postpone the government's judicial reform efforts was reached yesterday afternoon. You can head to CNN.com for updates.  Ten second trivia.  Which of these names translates to "snow covered mountains"? Pyrenees, Sierra Madre, Appalachian, or Sierra Nevada?  In Spanish, Sierra means mountain range. Nevada means snowclad.  California has been through it when it comes to weather. For the last three years, the state has been in a desperate need of rain. Just a month ago, about 33 million people were facing what's been called a mega drought. But now the pendulum has swung. Atmospheric rivers or narrow corridors of intense moisture in the atmosphere, dumping record rain and snowfall across the state. It's led to flooding, mudslides and more. Our CNN Meteorologist, Alli Chinchar is here to take us on a tour of the Sierra Nevada and break it all down for us. Also telling us how much rain and snow we're talking about.  ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Coy, it has been a record-breaking season of snowfall across the sierras this year. Take a look at this video. The snowfall piling up as high as a two-storey house and then some. This video is even taken back on February 28, and they've had even more snow since then.  But here's the thing about the sierras. It's broken into three separate categories. You have the northern, the central, and the southern region of the sierras. And all three of them, when you look, have actually been very impressive this year. But specifically, the southern sierras picking up 200, 86% of their snow water equivalent. What is that? Basically what it is. It takes into account all the snow pack that's on the ground. But then if you melted it, what would the water equivalent be?  And in the case of the southern sierras, it's been record breaking snow water equivalent. But how does this year compare to other years in the past? Let's break it down. This year has been extremely impressive, 228% of normal for that snow water equivalent.  When you look back at the previous years, they haven't even made it to normal amounts, let alone the impressive amount that we've had so far this year. But one thing to note is the impact it's had on the drought.  Now, when you get numerous systems like this and we've had at least a dozen atmospheric river events back-to-back, basically all of that water has to go somewhere. It's not just the rain coming down from the sky, but it melts some of that snowpack.  And then all of that water flows into rivers, creeks, and streams, and also onto roadways, into homes, into businesses, because those rivers, creeks, and streams end up becoming swollen and it's too much for the ground to absorb all at once.  Now, in the short-term, however, though, this has been very beneficial for the short-term drought. Look at California just back on December 6, when we had the extreme and exceptional drought categories. Fast forward to just a few days ago. Not a single portion of California is in those exceptional and extreme drought categories anymore.  WIRE:  Now, that's a good thing. Thanks, Alli. Any weather questions, reach out to @ Allison Chinchar on social.  All right. Up next, some inspiration and motivation from one of our CNN heroes, John Watson. He's a fitness instructor who created bloom fitness in honor of his daughter Emma. Mr. Watson leads students facing intellectual and developmental challenges through classes that unite, uplift and invigorate with great passion and energy.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOHN WATSON, BLOOM FITNESS INSTRUCTOR:  Yes. Come on, Cheryl. I need you.  When I'm front of them, it's an explosion of excitement every single time.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to do a spring cycle class.  ATHLETES:  Yes.  WATSON:  Bloom's mission is to lead people with intellectual and developmental disabilities to a lifetime of fitness.  (On camera):  These are really good bikes. You're going to love it. OK. (Voice-over):  Wellness and movement for this population, that's critical.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Amy is our fourth child.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Heart problems are very common for people with down syndrome, so fitness is very important.  WATSON:  All right, so you all been very patient today, so I might make some mistakes. You all okay with that?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Rafi has Prader-Willi syndrome. She has a very low metabolism, so she needs to keep moving and keep motivated. WATSON:  Let's rock and roll. We all know the benefits of fitness. Physical, emotional, and cognitive but they don't usually connect those dots.  (On camera):  Two, one, go.  (Voice-over):  Safety is first. But we want them to have fun. We want them to want to do it.  (On camera):  There you go. I love it. How are you cracking it over there? Hello, baby. You got it.  (Voice-over):  We wanted to make sure that the athlete that's in the room feels seen.  My daughter, Emma. Her diagnosis is basically cerebral palsy. She has balance problems. She's legally blind. She developed epilepsy, some seizures. But it's easy with them on to focus on the good parts.  Emma, you hoping to get a low one here?  EMMA:  No.  WATSON:  You're inspired how they work through challenges. I was looking for services for Emma and ways to help other parents. And so I came across a service provider. And when we walked around, they had a room with broken down fitness equipment. Guys, what happens here? They said nothing happens here. And I said, well, do you mind if I buy some bikes?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Hi, Richanna (ph). Come on in. WATSON:  We partner with these organizations that provide services for adults with disabilities. The cost to the athlete is nothing.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Both arms up overhead, inhale deeply.  WATSON:  All of our instructors are volunteers. We do Pilates, yoga, dance. Our classes are modified.  (On camera):  We're going to do little steps. That's where we're going to start.  (Voice-over):  We have a wide range of abilities. Somebody that may have limited movement. We specifically try to get them to move to how they can.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The energy, the excitement that they have to be a part of a team that means a lot to them.  WATSON:  Ryan, killing it. Come on, Cheryl, we're almost done.  (voice-over):  You're an athlete, no matter what your ability level is.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 musical artist, The Weeknd becoming the first in Spotify history to reach 100 million monthly listeners. It's a new Guinness World record. The Weeknd started making his name back in 2009, but this recent streaming surge was due to a collaboration with singer Ariana Grande that went viral on TikTok in 2021.  I wanted what Guinness World Record we could try to break right here on CNN 10. Maybe we'll figure it out.  Now, I went to a bookstore and I saw a book titled, How to End 50% of Your Problems. So I bought two of them. Dad Jokes onto my favorite part of the day.  Now, I want to give a special shout out to Kernersville Middle School in Kernersville, North Carolina. We see you.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, everyone. Coy Wire here. Wishing a wonderful Wednesday to you. I know we're just halfway through the week, but we're going to keep on grinding and shining, looking to be a little better today than we were yesterday. Now we are looking to the skies for our lead story today for the latest news on travel. March and April, they're considered peak season for spring break travel in America, and industry officials expect that upwards of 150 million people will fly during that two-month window alone. Travel is so busy during this time that officials at major spring break destinations like Miami, Orlando, Phoenix, Las Vegas and Los Angeles are asking passengers to arrive three hours early to the airport. One of our CNN 10 producers, Maya, said that she'd never seen security so packed at LaGuardia Airport in New York when she flew over the weekend. But tourism experts say that travel during this year's spring break actually isn't even as bad as it could have been. Bad flying experiences from last year have made some people skeptical about flying. Canceled flights and missed layovers left hundreds of thousands of travelers stranded. A series of close calls on runways has left some worried about their safety. And staffing shortages of aircraft technicians, flight dispatchers and pilots have some folks worrying about the efficiency of airlines and airports. So given all that, experts say that some travelers are playing it safe this year. Staying close to home. We'll hear now from CNN Correspondent Pete Muntean with tips for traveling from experts and passengers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT:  Spring break travel is soaring back to normal and renewing worry that your flight could be canceled. Meltdowns plagued the FAA in January. Southwest airlines over the holidays and industry wide last summer. GEOFF FREEMAN, PRESIDENT & CEO, U.S. TRAVEL ASSOCIATION:  The air travel system is under great stress. MUNTEAN:  The Federal Aviation Administration is already warning of a shortage of air traffic controllers that could cause increased delays. At New York's three major airports this summer, there a key air traffic control facility is at only 54% staffing. FREEMAN:  We're seeing it with delays, we're seeing with cancellations and that is leading some travelers to say, you know what, I would travel more if we could fix that air travel experience. MUNTEAN:  The latest figures from travel site Hopper show many travelers are concerned about flight disruptions. 20% of Hopper's spring break travelers are buying extra trip protection. That's on top of rising airfare up 4%, Hopper says, compared to 2019. KEN DANIELS, TRAVELER:  They were quite pricey this time of year. I guess due to spring break and due to what's going on in the economy. BYRON WITHERSPOON, TRAVELER:  They go up one day, they go down the next day. Just be diligent and be on point and when you see that good price, you won't hit the button. MUNTEAN:  Even still industry figures say 158 million Americans will fly for spring break. That's an average of 2.6 million travelers each day. HAYLEY BERG, LEAD ECONOMIST, HOPPER:  We're expecting this spring break to likely break records for number of travelers who are getting out there and how much they're spending given the huge demand coming out of the pandemic. MUNTEAN:  The top destinations Las Vegas, Orlando, Phoenix, Los Angeles and Miami where the airport says demand is 20% higher than 2019. So high that officials are asking you to show up three hours before a domestic flight instead of the typical two hours. GREG CHIN, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:  There are very few off-peak times right now for us. We have been the best alternative to leaving the country since COVID. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. What country shown here is located between India and Myanmar? Bangladesh, Thailand, Laos or Nepal? Home to over 165 million people, Bangladesh is the country shown on the map. A tech company is looking to bring a technology called iFarmer to farmers in Bangladesh, which provides them with financial resources and advice. The company's mission is to empower the farmers to yield more from the same amount of land. The catch is that investors in the technology charge the farmers a commission on their output, and that could be seen as taking advantage of those doing the hard labor. We'll learn more now about the software, which is said to have furthered the livelihood of 17 million farming households. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Here along the banks of the Jamuna River, around 100 miles northwest of Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, Hanufa Bibi farms chili peppers and corn. Yield is low recently, she says, due to changing weather conditions. But the 35-year-old farmer is looking to technology for solutions, an app called iFarmer. HANUFA BIBI, FARMER (through translator):  After iFarmer help we've had a good experience. We've got a good yield of corn, a good harvest, and we are profiting well. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  iFarmer hopes to further the livelihoods of Bangladesh's 17 million farming households. FAHD IFAZ, FOUNDER AND CEO, IFARMER:  iFarmer is an agri-tech company that provides farmers with access to finance, access to advisory services, and we help farmers to take their produce to the market. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Established in 2019, the startup scaled rapidly from a team of four to over 250 employees today, facilitating more than $19 million in small loans for farmers across the country, so far, they say. Agriculture is a vital part of Bangladesh's economy. Nearly half of the country's population is employed in the industry, with more than 70% of its land used for farming. However, farming's contribution to GDP is in decline. 25-year-old corn farmer, Jahidul Islam (ph), says the startup helped him set up a bank account and apply for a loan of around $470. And use soil sensors to give him personalized information about his crops. At the nearby iFarmer Center, Islam can also get advice on farming and purchase seeds, pesticides and fertilizers. iFarmer opened 100 of these centers, which it says supports more than 87,000 farmers using its platform. The startup plans to launch 1000 centers by the end of the year, with the hope of supporting half a million farmers by 2025. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is a real catch. A women's high school softball game in Texas took an unexpected turn when a base runner dodged and danced and pulled off an unbelievable prank on the catcher. It's not all that off base to say that this is an all-time must-see base running fake. Jeanne Moos has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Forget strikeouts, this was a fake out. Jada Walton from Carthage High School in East Texas headed for home plate, almost got tagged out and then pointed to first base. It's the classic made you look, look over there. The oldest trick in the book. And take another look. JADA WALTON, CARTHAGE SENIOR:  I really had no idea what to do. I was really just goofing around because I thought I was going to be out. MOOS:  Jada made it to home plate using the technique some use to steal food off a plate. The same Russ Marty used to sucker punch biff. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whoa biff? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What? MOOS:  And Back to the future that Arnold deployed -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Elephant. MOOS:  -- who escape in Last Action Hero Inside Edition dubbed Jada. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The Houdini of Softball. MOOS:  Even Major League Baseball gushed, you must see this all-time great base running fake out. As for those who said, the catcher deserves to be benched, Jada cried foul. I probably would have fell for it. Anybody would because she is really like a good player. Like she's the best on the team. MOOS:  By the way, Carthage won the game seven to five. And Jada won, bragging right. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Now that was awesome. We love when you touch base with us. It's #yourwordwednesday. So, follow me at Coy Wire on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok and put your unique vocab word in the comments section of my most recent post. And we're going to choose one fun one to work into tomorrow's show. Last week's vocab word was from Mr. Tros (ph) class at Dwight D. Eisenhower in West Berlin. Halcyon, meaning happier, peaceful times of the past. Now, for a special shout out, let's go to Michigan, Fruitport, Michigan and say, what's up, Fruitport Middle School, rise up. Thanks for all the love. Love right back at you. See you tomorrow, everyone. I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10. END230330

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hey, everybody, happy Thursday, or as I like to say, happy Friday eve. Overmorrow it will be Saturday. But first, let's finish this week strong. We've got a lot to get to, not a lot of time to do it, so let's get to it.  Now, teacher we're going to whip through some headlines, and as always, we recommend you preview each episode of CNN 10. One of them today involves coverage of school safety concerns following news out of Nashville this week. Here are some headlines from around the world.  This month, the U.S. and South Korea restarted joint military drills on the Korean Peninsula, including this simulated storming of a beach. These drills previously took place annually, but they hadn't happened at this scale in five years. The U.S. maintains that the drills are defensive in nature, while North Korea views this military cooperation as a threat.  In the United States, six people were killed in a school shooting in Nashville on Monday. This marked the 16th school shooting this year in the U.S. The tragic event has sparked further debate among lawmakers in Washington, D.C. over U.S. gun control laws and has many parents and school officials reviewing their safety protocols yet again.  Finally, in the art world, scientists say they've identified a secret ingredient in Leonardo da Vinci's paintings, egg yolks. That's right. According to a new study published this week, European painting masters like da Vinci may have used proteins, especially egg yolks, in their oil paintings.  This new study finds that the inclusion of egg was intentional and was a technique used to fine tune properties of the paint. That wraps your quick look at the headlines. Now pop quiz, hotshot.  Ten second trivia.  What is the capital of Australia? Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne or Brisbane?  Though Melbourne was once the capital, Canberra became the official capital of Australia in 1927.  Being a firefight fighter is one of the most dangerous professions on the planet. And did you know that wildfires in Australia are some of the largest and hottest on the planet? They can be devastating, completely destroying homes and habitats alike. But there's a group of volunteer firefighters in New South Wales working without pay to keep people and animals safe. We're going to meet two of these heroic people to hear why they're willing to risk it all to keep others safe.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAUREN WILSON, ADVANCE FIREFIGHTER, OAKS RURAL FIRE BRIGADE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL: When I tell people I'm a firefighter, I actually get a lot of mixed reactions. Oh, you do all that for free? What makes you do that? It really does spark a lot of curiosity in people.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Australia battles some of the largest and hottest wildfires on the planet. The fire season in Australia typically runs from October until the end of March, when temperatures are at their highest. Most of the firefighting is conducted by the Rural Fire Service, a volunteer force separate to state emergency services. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service has more than 70,000 members.  ANDREW HAIN, SENIOR DEPUTY CAPTAIN, PICTON RURAL FIRE BRIGADE INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT PLANNER: We were founded in 1939 by local farmers and local residents that needed a firefighting service in the area, and it was a bunch of guys with old trucks or trailers. Now we're sitting here in a million dollar plus facility with these trucks that are basically a multi- tool. We do flood work in this. We do fires, car accidents, house fires.  WILSON: We're coming into a family of a long line of firefighters. I believe there is that little bit of pressure. I can remember when I first told my father-in-law that I had joined. The first thing he said to me was, as long as you can operate a pump, you'll be fine.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As a volunteer service, recruits come from all walks of life and require intense training before being deployed.  HAIN: It's a huge amount of effort. A lot of hours go into training a new recruit. It's not for bragging rights, it's because they've got to go out on the truck with you. You need to be able to work with everybody from different backgrounds. You know, people that work in corporate, people that work in construction, you'd name it. We've probably got it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (Inaudible) they've come Picton 1 blue.  HAIN: The common thing is this desire to help people. So you've got to be willing to give your time to someone else for a thank you.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In 2019 and 2020, what became known as the Black Summer Fires burned 10.3 million land across the country.  HAIN: We were tasked to go into property protection, but the house was in a spot that was very difficult to defend. One road in, one road out. But then you walk around this house and you look in the back window and it is a carbon copy of my kids bedroom. There's Lego all over the floor, there's posters on the wall. This family have literally bundled everything they can into the car and they've left. They don't know that there's someone there to look after their house, but you staying there and maybe putting in that extra time and that extra work is going to be the reason they have a house to come back to.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The deadly fires claimed 33 lives, including nine firefighters. More than 3000 homes were destroyed. The house Andrew and his crew protected was one of 14,000 saved in New South Wales. Recent years have seen some of the largest fires ever recorded. Unchecked climate change means they could grow larger still.  HAIN: When I was growing up, there'd be fires and they'd occur, but there was nothing massive. Now they seem to be getting bigger and they talk about megafires and giga fires just on that scale. I don't recall anything like that.  The balance for work life, family life and the RFS can be difficult. I've got a five-year-old and a seven-year-old kid.  There any little boys at home?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Daddy. Daddy.  HAIN: Hello, buddy.  They see the yellow shirt goes on and they know something's happening. You know, they'll be like, handing me car keys as I'm going out the door. They're like a little support crew. It's quite funny.  It gets difficult to juggle, but the rewards worth it. When someone says, you know, we need help, and then you can be the person to go and deliver that help, that's very rewarding.  There's nothing tangible that you get given for it. It's just a sense of pride. I'll be with the service for as long as I can be, but whether that's time and an able body, or whether it just ends up not maybe being an able body. I'm just one of those old guys telling war stories. If it's of benefit, I'll be here for as long as they'll have me.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  I don't know if I need to quack any jokes today, because today's story, getting a 10 out of 10 about ducks is funny enough. There's an historic hotel in Memphis, Tennessee, called the Peabody, and it's said that the famous Peabody ducks own the hotel. They're basically celebrities treated like royalty. And hundreds of people gather every day to see a tradition that dates back 90 years, the March of the Peabody Ducks.  Why don't you see this? Meet the Duckmaster, Mr. Kenon Walker.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KENON WALKER, DUCKMASTER, THE PEABODY MEMPHIS: The duck march ceremony is exclusive to the Peabody Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee. There was a general manager back in 1933 that went on a duck hunting trip with a friend of his over in Arkansas. As a practical joke, they decided to bring back the live duck decoys that they were using and set them loose inside that fountain. Now, when the general manager woke back up the next morning in a clear mindset, I'm sure he probably got up and was like, when he got down here, there was a crowd of people standing around the fountain staring at these ducks.  So that led to ducks living in the fountain. But then seven years later, a man by the name of Edward Pembroke just so happened that he was an animal trainer in the Ringling Brothers in Barnum in Bailey Circus as a young man. And he was the one that came up with the idea of turning the ducks that's living in the fountain into a ceremony.  I have the honor and the pleasure of marching the ducks for you all this morning.  My title here at the Peabody Hotel is of the Duckmaster. A very unusual title to hold. It's my job to train the team of ducks that we have here and they have a $200,000 Duck Palace upstairs on the rooftop. There would be at least two to 300 people on the busy days. The number of people doing the duck march, we're talking into the thousand.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ladies and gentlemen, if I may direct your attention to the elevators having just left their penthouse on the roof to join you. Looking good. Ladies and gentlemen, the march of the world-famous Peabody Ducks.  WALKER: All the way to the fountain, I need everybody to use the steps. Come on, duckies. Let's do it. Everybody say good morning, Duckies.  CROWD: Good morning, Duckies:  WALKER: Fantastic. Everybody use those steps for me. Everybody up the steps. Looking good there's. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Great job, Duckies.  To know you're providing an experience that's unlike any other, it's a privilege. I don't consider it a job. I feel like it's no pun intended, but it's a calling.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  We love puns, and they should always be intended. All right. I told a taradiddle I will quack a joke today. What do ducks wear to fancy parties? A duck-sedo. All right. We had some great your word Wednesday submissions. Vocabulary words are off the charts. Awesome. Thanks to @Mikayla04264. Taradiddle, a noun meaning a petty lie.  And thanks to Pocono Mountain East High School for overmorrow, meaning the day after tomorrow. Well done. Shoutout time now, we're headed to Massachusetts to Tyngsborough, home of the Griffins, Greater Lowell Technical High School, you rock. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one.  I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10.  END230331

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, lovely people. It's Friday. Finally, happy that you're spending some time with me. If you're hyped and you're liking this rhyme with me, we'll do it again on the 10. That'd be fine by me. Hey, now, let's go. It's been an awesome week and we're going to finish this week strong. We're starting today's show, we're going to talk about the big news on the artificial intelligence front. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is, in simple terms, technology that enables machines to mimic human intelligence. It includes a wide range of technology, though. There are personal assistants like Siri on smartphones or Alexa on devices in houses. There are self-driving cars, food serving robots and lots more. AI technology is rapidly evolving, and it has the potential to completely change society even more as we know it. A product launched this year called ChatGPT is grabbing headlines because of its uncanny ability to have intelligent conversations with humans, answer questions in written form and mimic people nearly perfectly. Experts are now voicing some serious concerns. There's potential for AI to increasingly take more jobs away from people, allow students to easily cheat in school, and for people to use other identities to spread misinformation. In some cases, AI technology is now being created to combat the problems that were caused by AI in the first place. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EDWARD TIAN, FOURNDER, GPTZERO:  It's incredible innovation. At the same time, it's like opening a Pandora's box. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS & POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Which is why Edward Tian, a 22-year-old Princeton student himself, spent his winter break building GPTZero, which he says can detect whether something is likely written by a human or ChatGPT. He says teachers use it to check their students' papers. (On camera):  Is this like one AI cross checking another AI? TIAN:  In a sense, yeah. (On camera):  But can it spot misinformation? TIAN:  Oh, OK. Yeah. So as opposed to misinformation, it's more of like it can only spot if something is AI generated or human generated. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Major leaders in tech like Elon Musk, professors and researchers, are so concerned about the rapid development of artificial intelligence that they're now calling for AI labs to stop developing the technology completely for at least six months. They signed a letter which is published by the Future of Life Institute, a nonprofit backed by Musk. The letter comes just two weeks after OpenAI announced GPT-4, an even more powerful version of the ChatGPT technology. This version was able to pass tests, create websites, even draft lawsuits. The tech leaders want experts to develop a set of protocols or rules for AI, and they said if they don't, the government needs to step in and stop it. CNN's Correspondent Donie O'Sullivan met with a professor at UC Berkeley School of Information and tried out an AI software that mimics voices to see how powerful and dangerous this technology could be. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NOREEN O'SULLIVAN, MOTHER OF DONIE O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Hello? A.I. DONIE O'SULLIVAN:  Hi, mom. N. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Hi, Donie. How are you? A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  Does my voice sound different to you? N. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Yeah, I just said that to Sinead (Donie's sister). I said Donie sounds so American. (LAUGHTER) A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  This is not actually me. This is a voice made by computer. N. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Oh, my God. Are you serious? A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  Yeah, sorry. DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  There has been an explosion and fake audio and voices being generated through artificial intelligence technology. AI-GENERATED VOICE:  This is an A.I. clone version of Walter White's voice. AI-GENERATED VOICE:  This is an A.I. clone version of Leonardo de Caprio's voice. O'SULLIVAN:  All you need is a couple minutes recording of anyone's voice and you can make it seem like they have said just about anything, even -- AI-GENERATED VOICE:  Anderson Cooper. We've come here to U.C. Berkeley today to talk to Hany Farid, a digital forensic expert, about just how easy it is to put words into other people's mouths. O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  It's a lot of fun. HANY FARID, PROFESSOR, UC BERKLEY SCHOOL OF INFORMATION:  Sure. O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  But it's also really scary. FARID:  I think once you put aside that Jewish (ph) factor, I don't think it takes a long time to look at the risks. AI-GENERATED VOICE:  This is Wolf Blitzer. Hany Farid, you're in the situation room. FARID:  That's good. O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  That sounds real. (Voice-over):  By uploading just a few minutes of me and so my colleagues' voices to an A.I. audio service, I was able to create some convincing fakes. The technology did struggle with my Irish accent, but we decided to put it to the ultimate test with my parents. (On camera):  I'm about to try call my mom back in Ireland and see if I can trick her with this voice. FARID:  Yeah. O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  Let's see if we are going to be successful. FARID:  I'm nervous. My hands are. (LAUGHTER) O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  All right. (RINGING) N. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Hello? A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  Hi, mom. N. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Hi, Donie. How are you? A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  Just finished shooting our story here. I'm going to the airport in a while. N. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  There seems to be a delay in the phone, Donie. A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  Can I say a quick hello to dad? N. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Yep. DONAL O'SULLIVAN, FATHER OF DONIE O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Hi, Donie. A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  Hi, dad. D. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  How are you doing? A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  How are you? D. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Good, yourself? A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  Just finished shooting our story here. I am going to the airport in a while. D. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Oh, you're going back to New York? A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  Are Kerry playing this weekend? D. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  They're playing Tyrone Sunday. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  My dad went on to have a conversation with the A.I. Donie about how Kerry, our home football team, had a game that weekend. Eventually, I had to come clean. (On camera):  Dad, I will give you a call better later on. Can you just put me back to mom for a second? (Voice-over):  My parents knew something was off, but ultimately, they still fell for it. N. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Oh, yeah, some of it don't be bad, but it was like -- it was like your voice was a little tone lower and it sounded like very serious like you had something serious to say. Because I went, oh, jeez, my heart was hopping first. O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  Oh, sorry. D. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  I thought the voice was very funny. Thought the voice was very funny, yeah. O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  All right, I'll call you later, dad. D. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  OK, bye-bye. O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  Bye. FARID:  This is not classic. The mom is like, something is wrong with my son. The dad is like, everything is fine. (LAUGHTER) AI-GENERATED VOICE:  I'd like to close out today's ceremony with a question. If you are given a choice, would you choose to have unlimited bacon but no more video games? O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  With fake Biden and Trump recordings going viral online, Farid says this could be something to be wary of going into the 2024 election. FARID:  When we enter this world where anything can be fake, any image, any audio, any video, any piece of text, nothing has to be real, we have what's called a liars' dividend, which is that anybody can deny reality. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  With a flood of new A.I. tools releasing online, he says companies developing this powerful technology need to think of its potential negative effects. FARID:  There is no online and offline world. There is one world. And it is fully integrated. When things happen on the internet, they have real implications for individuals, for communities, for societies, for democracies. And I don't think we as a field have fully come to grips with our responsibility here. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  In the meantime, I will continue annoying my colleagues. (On camera):  Hear this thing Anderson said. AI-GENERATED VOICE:  I have been doing this a long time. I have to say, Donie O'Sullivan is probably the best in the business. O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  Incredible. FARID:  Very good. O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  That's very kind of him to say that as well. FARID:  You know, you should be honored, really. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second Trivia. The name of which of these prehistoric creatures means "king of the tyrant lizards?" Velociraptor, Tyrannosaurus rex, Supersaurus, or Titanosaurus?

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, everyone? I'm Coy Wire, coming to you from Houston, Texas, today. Rise up.  I am here covering all the action at this year's final four and the college basketball national championship game. I am so grateful to be here with you to help you jump start your week right here on CNN 10. Now we do start today with some tragic news for our lead story. The communities in the South and Midwest regions of the United States were hit by severe tornadoes, more than 50 preliminary tornado reports were recorded Friday in at least seven states and communities across the country faced absolute devastation this weekend. Neighborhoods were leveled with homes and businesses destroyed, the roofs of buildings were torn off by wind and as of Sunday, when we recorded our show, 27 people have been reported dead.  And the threat of more tornadoes had shifted to the southern plains where nearly 13 million people in north Texas, including the Dallas-Fort Worth area face an enhanced risk for severe weather. The latest destructive weather across the South and Midwest comes just a week after a severe tornado walloped up the southeast, killing at least another 26 people and destroying much of Rolling Fork, Mississippi.  In addition, storms have also knocked out power to these struggling communities. When we recorded our show Sunday, more than 30,000 customers in Arkansas remain impacted by power outages, with hundreds of thousands more without power across the south and northeast, including 120,000 in Pennsylvania, 73,000 in Ohio.  The governors of Indiana, Iowa, Illinois and Arkansas have all declared emergency or disaster declarations in their states to provide immediate assistance to impacted counties. President Joe Biden has also issued a major disaster declaration for Arkansas.  We'll hear now from CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam who's currently in Wynne, Arkansas, assessing the damage. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  We are in badly devastated Wynne, Arkansas, where electrical vehicles and companies are on the scene, trying to assess the initial damage here that the mayor described has literally split his town in half. And we are standing directly in that path from this devastating tornado.  I want you to see behind me, this is a home, that is a living room and that's somebody's piano. There's no music being played there today. This house has been vacated. There have been injuries.  Overnight, there were active search and recovery efforts taking place. We've walked around this area. The Wynne high school here in Arkansas, home to the Yellowjackets, their home football field was decimated by this tornado and I want you to see it from the air because you can notice the kind of indiscriminate nature of a tornado and how its path of destruction is very concentrated.  It's literally like peeling back the skin off of an orange, took the artificial turf and ripped it off of their home field. But on the other side of the football field, it was left untouched so were some homes. but the areas where it hit hardest of course completely devastated and we have seen just the true nature of how incredible Mother Nature can be. It is a scary morning as we get first light and get a idea of just how bad this tornado really was. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Former President Donald Trump is expected to appear in a New York courtroom tomorrow, following a formal criminal charge late last week by a Manhattan grand jury. The charges include more than 30 counts related to business fraud, but the specific details of the indictment have not been made public. This is the first time in U.S. history that a current or former president has been criminally charged.  But did you know that Ulysses S. Grant was once arrested for speeding. That's right, speeding on his horse-drawn carriage all the way back in 1872. Now, in response to the charges, the former president has maintained his innocence and claims that the charges are politically motivated. The unprecedented nature of bringing a former U.S. president in for criminal charges has activated a complex choreographed security effort in the city of New York. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz is in Manhattan as the city prepares for Tuesday's arraignment. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  With an unprecedented indictment comes immense security challenges. The NYPD, along with court officers U.S. marshals and the United States secret service are running through logistics of how Tuesday's historic arraignment of the former president will go down. Law enforcement sources telling CNN officials are conducting a dry run of Trump's movements including his motorcade route to the courthouse in downtown Manhattan where he is expected to be arraigned Tuesday afternoon. How he will get inside the courtroom flanked by Secret Service and what will the arrest process look like. Will he be treated like any other defendant?  The former president expected to be fingerprinted and photographed for a mug shot. It's a massive effort starting when Trump arrives by plane Monday, securing Trump Tower, the court and the motorcade route. KENNETH COREY, FORMER NYPD CHIEF OF DEPARTMENT:  In this case though where you have a former president and certainly a president with as large a following as former President Trump, there's a lot of unique concerns that are going to come into play. I think that the bigger unknown here is going to come in the form of protests or potential protests.  PROKUPECZ:  Officials are also bracing for protests after Trump urged his supporters to protest his arrest when news of the indictment reportedly neared.  So far, the mayor's office says there are no credible threats to the city and out of an abundance of caution, every member of the NYPD, some 35,000 officers, are reporting for duty in uniform and prepared for mobilization. COREY:  The challenge for the NYPD is going to be protecting everybody's First Amendment right, allowing everybody to have their voice heard and to do so in a way that keeps the peace. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next, we're catching up with Nelly Cheboi who was named CNN Hero of the Year. Her non-profit organization TechLit has gained widespread recognition for its efforts to up-cycle old computers and provide tech education to rural communities in Kenya. We'll delve into Nelly's experiences since winning the award and here firsthand what it meant to achieve such a momentous victory. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON COOPER AND KELLY RIPA, CNN TOP CNN HEROES HOSTS:  Nelly Cheboi. (CHEERS) NELLY CHEBOI, CNN HERO OF THE YEAR:  You can only imagine like how crazy it was when I was named the CNN Hero of the Year. I thought I was like, I'm about to fall down. I look at the audience. You know, it was my mom screaming back at me. Like most women that come before her, they die in poverty like that's all they know -- poverty. I don't think it can get any bigger than that.  It was really heartwarming to see that the work was bigger than me now. WILLIAM RUTO, KENYAN PRESIDENT:  We also congratulate Nelly Cheboi. CHEBOI:  The president of Kenya congratulated me, talked about TechLit, which has become a household name in Kenya. Everyone knows that we are teaching kids computer skills. What I'm really excited about is the future in Kenya and in the rest of the continent where kids are going to be learning about the tech world. Let's start with him. There's hope like poverty has an expiration date, right?  When you were growing up in poverty, you think of yourself as less than. I knew just how powerful the kids celebrating this award was, I wanted to turn that into like hey, yes, this can happen for you, too. Yes. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Who invented the game of basketball? Jerry West, James Naismith, Abner Doubleday or Walter Camp? On December 21st, 1891, PE instructor James Naismith using a soccer ball and two peach baskets created what was called a new game of ball. (MUSIC) WIRE:  Today's story getting a out of is from right here in Texas. We've had a ball covering what's been called the wildest final four of all time, women's and men's. Last night in the women's championship game, it was LSU winning it all. They've been led all season by superstar Angel Reese and their hall of fame coach, of course, Kim Mulkey, who has some of the most flamboyant fashion in all of sports. You go, Tigers! Congrats to LSU.  And tonight, right here in Houston in that stadium behind me, the men's title game. It'll be San Diego State and UConn playing for all the marbles. I caught up with the head coaches from each team and found out that they are both superstitious. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIAN DUTCHER, SAN DIEGO STATE MEN'S BASKETBALL COACH:  I wear the same shoes, the same socks, you know, I'm -- I'm -- I'm trying to stay consistent with what I've got on for every game. We're on a win streak, I don't want to change anything. WIRE:  Same shoes, how long you've been wearing them? DUTCHER:  They've been through two Gatorade baths, two cutting down of nets. WIRE:  Is it true that you've been wearing a certain same sort of a clothing article for superstitious reasons? DAN HURLEY, UCONN MEN'S BASKETBALL COACH:  Yeah, I -- that's definitely true, as well as the socks. But the socks are unremarkable, they're just a blue pair. WIRE:  But the same pair. HURLEY:  Same pair and I've gone back to an older pair of shoes that I won at Rhode Island when we -- when we won in the NCAA tournament there. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Now, I'm not superstitious, but I am sometimes a little bit stitches. How about you? Any superstitions?  One thing we always do though because we believe it keeps the good mojo flowing is give a shout-out every show to show you some love.  Today's shout out is going to Rochester, Minnesota. Willow Creek Middle School, go Wildcats! We see you we hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire and we are CNN 10. END230404

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Terrific Tuesday to you.  I'm still here in Houston after watching a great NCAA men's national championship basketball game last night. It has been awesome. Running into some of you while I've been here. Thanks for all the love. All right. Let's get this show started, shall we?  Let's start among the stars with some news from outer space, as it's looking likely that we'll be seeing some history being made. NASA's Frank Rubio on track to become the first American astronaut to spend a full year in space. Rubio traveled to the International Space Station back on September 21st, thinking it would be just a six-month mission.  He was expected to land back on Earth this spring, but the Russian spacecraft that carried Rubio and two of his Russian colleagues actually had a coolant leak in December. Russia's space agency later announced that it wouldn't have been safe for the spacecraft to bring all the astronauts home. This means Rubio has to stay even longer in space. NASA announced the early is he can return to earth now will be on September 27th and that would mean he'd be logging at least 371 days in orbit.  Rubio's tour of duty would be historic as it would surpass the previous American record which is 355 days set just last year. The world record still belongs to a Russian cosmonaut who logged 437 continuous days in orbit aboard Russia's Mir space station back in 1994 and '95.  Now, this is all really a unique situation particularly because even though the U.S. and Russia have intense geopolitical tensions here on Earth, both superpowers are working hand in hand when it comes to space exploration. Our Michael Holmes has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A collaboration in space when relations between Russia and the U.S. on earth are at their worst in decades. NASA and Russia's space agency Roscosmos say they've signed a long-sort seat swapping agreement which would allow astronauts and cosmonauts to exchange places on missions. NASA says the first of these cross flights is expected when U.S. astronaut Frank Rubio blasts off to the International Space Station on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft. And cosmonaut Anna Kikina joins the fifth SpaceX crew Dragon launch the same month. Historic rivals space exploration has always been a point of highs and lows for Russia in the U.S., both trying to outdo each other in the 1960s space race. The Soviet Union sending the first man into outer space, the U.S. landing the first crew on the moon. But in recent decades, space has been more of a joint effort between the two nations, especially after the creation of the ISS, which is operated by NASA, Roscosmos and several other space agencies.  Both the U.S. and Russia have hitched rides with each other. Russian cosmonauts flew on the U.S. space shuttle before the fleet was replied in 2011. After that, American astronauts traveled to the ISS on Soyuz spacecraft, until NASA resumed its own launches in 2020 by partnering with the commercial space company SpaceX.  (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  When Arkansas,  home of the Yellowjackets, we are currently standing on what was the home football field for the Wynne high school.  Look at this -- this is one of the light structures that were supposed to illuminate this field. You can see some of the broken lights here below us.  But what's most astounding to this meteorologist is just the true force of this powerful twister that tore this path of devastation. Hard to get the perspective but I'll show you an aerial what you're looking at is the peeled back artificial turf that was sucked up by the powerful updraft of this tornado.  There it is still in place in the distance and then look at what's behind me here, like a skin of an orange being peeled back. This is what's left leaving the rock exposed below it and behind me, Wynne Yellowjackets proudly displayed on the water tower. This area has received significant to catastrophic damage. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: in which of these countries would you find the world's tallest waterfall? Venezuela, Canada, Peru or Zimbabwe? Located in the South American country of Venezuela, the 3,200-foot Angel Falls is the tallest fall of them all. Now, some people don't go chasing waterfalls. They stick to the rivers and lakes that they're used to. But in Venezuela, some things just aren't what they used to be like news anchors. Venezuelans are seeing increased fake news and widespread misinformation about their country through avatars, fake anchors made of artificial intelligence reporting the news.  Though the avatars may have been created as a faster way to communicate information these fake videos are now being used to hide real problems going on inside Venezuela and many see it as propaganda. Stefano Pozzebon is on the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  This isn't actually a real person. Take a closer look. This fake avatar was created using artificial intelligence to look like a real human. In recent months, videos like these have been shared across Venezuelan social media and even on state-run television to spread misinformation about the country. FAKE AVATAR:  Media from different countries had described the event organized by Venezuela as a total and unexpected success. POZZEBON:  This year, Venezuelans have been taken to the street to demand better living conditions. The country's minimum wage is less than ten dollars a month. And last year, inflation was over 200 percent.  But this artificial news clips have been trying to make the country look more prosperous. Marivi Marvin Vasquez (ph), the executive director at ProBox, a Venezuelan- based organization that monitors for online misinformation, says that these A.I.-generated people have been created and spread with a specific purpose. MARIVI MARVIN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, PROBOX:  To sell to the international community a different reality about the country, of success, happiness and stability that really doesn't exist. FAKE AVATAR:  So how true is it that Venezuela is such a poor country? Has the media exaggerated things in that place? POZZEBON:  And it's not just social media. The Venezuelan government itself is helping to spread these videos on social media and even on state-run television. Even Nicolas Maduro, the country's embattled president, has shared the videos. NICOLAS MADURO, VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT (translated):  They are all artificial intelligence. They do not exist. They are robots created by artificial intelligence. I am robot.  POZZEBON:  These fake videos are often in English with Spanish subtitles and are shared on social media which is often a trusty source of news for many Venezuelans, because the government imposes strict controls on the country's traditional media. CRISTINA TARDAGUILA, SENIOR PROGRAM DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR JOURNALISTS:  You go from completely lack of reliable information in the traditional media, in your region, and then you go towards the other end. So, you're suddenly like eating, drinking, smelling everything that is on your WhatsApp or your telegram or your social media. FAKE AVATAR:  Start by selecting an A.I. avatar. FAKE AVATAR:  Like me. FAKE AVATAR:  Or me. FAKE AVATAR:  Or me. POZZEBON:  These A.I. avatars are advertised as a way for companies to create easy to make instructional videos for example. The company behind the technology says that it's not intended to spread false narratives. When asked for comment, the company told CNN that it has since banned House of News from using it's A.I. software. YouTube has also removed the channel from its platform.  It's still unclear who originally created these videos, as well as if the Venezuelan government was involved. The government did not respond to CNN's request for comment. FAKE AVATAR:  Hey there. I'm Matt and I can -- POZZEBON:  If you're unsure about whether or not a video that you're watching is done by one of these fake avatars, pay close attention to their speech and mouth movement. FAKE AVATAR:  Has a dozen pavilions that occupy 23 hectares. POZZEBON:  Do their words align with the movements of their mouth. Do this movement feel awkward or constricted.  FAKE AVATAR:  Security will be in charge of guards from the general directory. POZZEBON:  If that is the case, you're watching a digital avatar. It's not a real person. FAKE AVATAR:  In Venezuela, it is estimated that 8 million people will mobilize in the next vacation. POZZEBON:  When your friend and your own government are sharing this misinformation, it demands a lot more vigilance to see through the lies and find the truth. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. We started this show way up high in the sky in space but now we're taking you way down underwater for today's 10 out of 10.  Scientists filmed the deepest fish on record. They released this footage of a young snail fish swimming deep in the trenches off of Japan at a depth of more than 27,000 feet. That's almost as deep as the 29,000-foot Mount Everest is high, and this fish is about 2,000 feet deeper than the previous record. Marine biologists said that younger deep sea snail fish like this one often stay as deep as possible to avoid being eaten by bigger predators swimming above. Now some other fish are swimming down solo because they dropped out of school. Hey, yo, dad jokes for you. Let's finish this strong with my favorite part of the show. I want to give a special shout out to Park Middle School in Lincoln, Nebraska. We see you representing the Corn Husker State.  Thanks for subscribing and commenting on our CNN YouTube Channel, and thanks for all the love. Many blessings y'all. Go out and make it an awesome day. I'm Coy Wire and we are CNN 10. END230405

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, friends. Coy Wire here. So happy to be with you.  It is #YourWordWednesday. So, hit me up @CoyWire on Insta, Snapchat and TikTok and put your unique vocabulary word in the comment section of my most recent post and we'll pick and fun one to work into tomorrow's show. Last week's word from @Makaela0426 was taradiddle. Meaning a petty little lie.  Without further ado, let's do what we do. CNN 10 starts right now. We start in New York City where former President Donald Trump was scheduled to appear in a courtroom yesterday, facing criminal charges. Last week, the former president was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury. The charges include more than 30 counts related to business fraud. The Manhattan's district attorney's office has been investigating Trump's alleged role in a hush money payment scheme, and subsequent cover-up dating back to the 2016 presidential campaign. Throughout this legal process, though, Trump has maintained his innocence and has denied any wrongdoing. The former president also accuses Democrats of targeting him politically with these charges. A recent CNN poll shows that 60 percent of Americans approve of the indictment. That same survey says that most Americans, 76 percent, do believe that politics played at least some role in this indictment. Prior to the court appearance yesterday, Trump's legal team said the former president would voluntarily surrender and would look to challenge every potential issue once the indictment was unsealed. This arraignment is historic. It was the first time a current or former U.S. president has been criminally charged. We'll take a look now at the events of the day. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIKE VALERIO, CNN NEWSOURCE NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Former President Trump is now back in Florida, saying on Truth Social that he did nothing wrong and nothing illegal, but prosecutors here in Lower Manhattan would certainly beg to differ, accusing him of engaging in a criminal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election. (voice-over):  Former President Donald Trump indicted and arraigned on 34 counts related to business fraud. Tuesday's legal proceedings relatively short, but its impact on American history seismic, unprecedented. Trump is now the first ever former or sitting president to be criminally charged.  TODD BLANCHE, FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S ATTORNEY:  He's frustrated. He's upset. But I tell you what? He's motivated and it's not going to stop him and it's not going to slow him down, and it's -- it's exactly what he expected. ALVIN BRAGG, MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY:  Thirty-four false statements made to cover up other crimes. These are felony crimes in New York state, no matter who you are. We cannot and will not normalize serious criminal conduct. VALERIO:  Trump is already looking ahead towards a possible trial, posting Tuesday morning that it should be moved to Staten Island, because Manhattan would be, quote, very unfair.  The security around the New York City courthouse was ramped up ahead of Tuesday's arraignment, with overall peaceful crowds gathering before and against Trump.  The next step for Trump, back at home at Mar-a-Lago Tuesday night, where his lawyers have said they'll dissect every charge in the now unsealed indictment and plan their defense. And the judge in this case did not issue a gag order, meaning that the former president can talk about this matter, but the judge here in Lower Manhattan urged both sides -- the former president and the prosecution -- to refrain from inflammatory rhetoric. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia:  What was the only U.S. battleship to get underway during Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941? USS California, West Virginia, Nevada or Oklahoma? The USS Nevada was the only battleship to start moving though it was hit by a torpedo and multiple bombs. We'll head to Pearl Harbor now for our next story. Last year, the U.S. announced a landmark submarine deal with Australia and the U.K. where nuclear-powered submarines will be sent to Western Australia. These underwater warships will be strategically located there in case China, which has the world's largest navy, looks to possibly grow its presence in the Pacific region.  So how massive are these U.S. submarines? Our Will Ripley gives us an exclusive look inside the USS Mississippi. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Our journey begins in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the bustling hub of the U.S. Pacific fleet, covering almost half the world, 100 million square miles, 1,500 aircraft, and around 200 ships, including more than half of the navy's nuclear-powered submarines.  Today, we're getting an exclusive look inside the USS Mississippi, one of the most powerful warships on the planet -- with a crew of around 140 people.  Rear Admiral Jeff Jablon is commander of the Pacific fleet submarine force, facing new powerful threats in the hotly contested Indo-Pacific. The Mississippi is one of 49 fast attack submarines in the U.S. Naval fleet. The fleet also has 14 larger submarines carrying nuclear-armed ballistic missiles. The U.S., U.K. and Australia's newly announced AUKUS partnership will send nuclear-powered submarines to Perth, potentially challenging China's ambitions for the region. Beijing now has the world's largest navy, but U.S. submarines have the world's most advanced technology, a key advantage in underwater warfare. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mississippi is ready to dive. UNIDENTIFIED MALES:  Dive! RIPLEY:  The sub is capable of diving deep and fast, descending hundreds of feet in a matter of seconds. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Three hundred feet. RIPLEY:  At angles of up to 25 degrees, even standing up can be a challenge. Traveling underwater makes the submarine almost impossible to detect, the nuclear reactor is so quiet, the sub submarine makes less noise than a whale. In the dark depths of the ocean, there's no light to navigate. The team relies on highly sensitive sonar. The USS Mississippi, like all of America's nuclear submarines, can't essentially sustain itself under the water for weeks or even months at a time because of the nuclear reactor that powers them. They breathe recirculated air and purified water. The only thing that they need to actually get resupplied with is food for the crew members and that means that they get used to spending a very long time not only without sunshine and blue skies but also without regular communication or conversations with their families. The food on submarines is surprisingly good, but spending months under water can be tough. No mobile phones allowed. Outside communication only possible on emails. At the back of the sub, Jack O'Brien works with a team of technical engineers. Do you ever get bored on a sub? JACK O'BRIEN, CREW MEMBER, USS MISSISSIPPI:  No, no, that's absolutely not. Every day I come in, thinking I know what I'm -- thinking I know exactly what's going to happen, what I got to do. RIPLEY:  Rear Admiral Jablon says deterrence is the key objective. Submarines like the USS Mississippi are constantly preparing for war, ready at a moment's notice for whatever the future holds. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Our next story now takes us to Berkeley microbiology lab where we're given a 10 out of 10 to a furry squirrel who learned how to ring a bell to get a treat. This video has gone viral on TikTok and shows us just how smart these bushy-tailed tree dwellers can be.  Our Jeanne Moos shows us how this little squirrel is treating an office building window like his very own fast food drive through. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  What does this California squirrel have in common with these humans? Ringing for service can drive a person squirrely.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I heard this like incessant ringing noise, I was like what is going on, and my co-worker was like, oh, we taught the squirrel to ring the bell. MOOS:  Grad students and researchers at this Berkeley microbiology lab enjoy feeding a squirrel who comes to their window ledge. But recently, they trained the squirrel to ring the bell to get a treat. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Good job, Kluyver. MOOS:  They named him Kluyver after a famous microbiologist Albert Kluyver. Online posters were smitten though someone griped, he only gets one almond after all that? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think we don't want the squirrel to rely on us as the main source of food. MOOS:  They trained Kluyver by making the bell ring whenever he begged and if he happened to strike the string waving his paws he got a knot. But the peanut gallery complained, lower the bell, jeez. So they not only lowered the string, they gave the squirrel a step stool mug. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I lengthened the string. Yeah, I caved into the criticism a little bit. MOOS:  In the immortal words of Lurch.  LURCH:  You rang? (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Awesome sauce. All right, now, we can't finish this show without my favorite part.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, my friends. Happy Friday Eve. It's Thursday. But not just any Thursday. It's random thought Thursday. How much dirt is in a hole that measures two inches by three inches by four inches? You think about it and I'll tell you at the end of the show. All right, let's get you your news now, shall we? I'm Coy Wire, this is CNN 10. And we start today with these tales of two housing markets here in the United States. So, what's all the hullabaloo? We're in the spring season now, and that usually means a frenetic time for home buying. Now, during the pandemic, Silicon Valley, the West Coast cities and places like Austin saw a boom in the housing market. But now we're seeing that bubble burst. With continuous tech layoffs, bank failures and low housing supply, we're seeing the home buying cooling rapidly. So, sellers in many of those areas, well, they don't have the upper hand anymore. But on the other side of the country, on the East Coast, we're seeing a totally different story. Home prices are actually continuing to rise there, especially in major southeastern cities, a big impact to all of this housing volatility is the higher average rates on a 30-year fixed mortgage, where it's making a lot more expensive to finance a home today compared to a year ago. The continued high inflation rate has been a contributing factor as well. Our Chief Business Correspondent, Christine Romans, explains these divergent trends we're seeing in the U.S. housing market. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  The biggest investment most people ever make is their home. And after nine interest rate hikes from the Fed, it's a tale of two housing markets today in America, where the bubble appears to have popped in the West Coast tech hubs and the pandemic boom towns but holding up rather well out east. All real estate is local, of course, but the trends are revealing Redfin measures pending home sales. Price drops and supply and found Austin, Texas is the fastest cooling metro area in the country. It was once the pandemic relocation magnet of course, Seattle is next. Then Phoenix, Tacoma, Denver, Vegas and four California cities round out the top 10. But head east and upper Midwest and northeast towns are cooling much more slowly, and home price is out east still rising. Case Shiller shows home prices in these cities up year over year. They're not skyrocketing like the last 10 years, but they're holding in. Travel to the southeast and it is a boom time in real estate. Miami home prices in January up nearly 14% from a year ago. Tampa up 10.5%, Atlanta, 8.4% and Charlotte up 8.1%. You can clearly see sellers have the upper hand in the Sun Belt, a sharp contrast to the home prices in the tech hubs out west, where prices are falling sharply, led by San Francisco, where prices fell almost 8% in January compared with last year. This is, of course, after years of runaway price gains in those tech hubs. Call it a real estate reckoning out west, tech company pink slips, bank jitters, low inventory and mortgage rates that have almost doubled. Higher rates make the same home a year ago a lot more expensive to finance today. A $400,000 mortgage taken out at today's mortgage rates would cost almost $400 more a month in the extra interest. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, the list of the world's busiest airports came out. And once again, the busiest airport in the world is right here, Atlanta. According to the Airports Council International, the U.S. actually had half of the 10 busiest airports in the world last year. Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International took the title for a second consecutive year as the world's busiest airport in terms of passenger volume. Coming in second was Dallas-Fort Worth. Then it was followed by Denver, then Chicago O'Hare. Los Angeles came in 6th on the list. The other five airports in the top 10 were cities abroad., Dubai, Istanbul, Heathrow Airport in London, New Delhi and Paris. The airport's Council International also expects strong travel recovery this year for global passenger traffic and a full recovery by next year that we haven't seen since 2019. Ten second trivia. In Greek mythology, who was Apollo's twin sister and the goddess of the moon? Artemis, Luna, Athena or Diana? Artemis is your answer here. And she also served as the goddess of the hunt and wild animals. Artemis is also connected to space exploration. And that's where our next story takes us. It has been 50 years since astronauts returned to the moon, but NASA just announced its team for its next moon mission. These four astronauts, three Americans and one Canadian will make their journey to outer space on Artemis 2 in November of 2024. This will also be an historic mission as it will be the first time a woman and a person of color will be on a lunar flight. Our Ed Lavandera sat down with the newly named crew. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ladies and gentlemen, your Artemis 2 crew. ED LAVANDERA, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  NASA calls this moment the launch of the Artemis Generation and the space agency has unveiled its first cosmic rock stars. Commander Reid Wiseman, Pilot Victor Glover, Mission Specialist Christina Koch and Canadian Jeremy Hansen. CNN sat down with the crew of the Artemis 2 Mission. (On camera):  Armstrong, Aldrin, Collins, Borman, Lovell, Anders, those are all iconic astronauts that touch the moon or grace the edges of the moon. Your names go next to those guys. How did you find out about this and how does it feel quite frankly? CHRISTINA KOCH, NASA ASTRONAUT:  The leader of our flight operations director had said to us, and he said, how would you like to go flying on Artemis 2? My answer to him was, sir, it would be an honor. It's amazing to be a part of this team, that's going back to the Moon and on to Mars and it's exciting times that we're actually making this step. LAVANDERA:  If all goes as planned, the Artemis 2 crew will orbit the moon next year. For about 10 days, they will aim to travel farther into space than any humans have ever gone. They'll fly in the Orion spacecraft, paving the way for future Artemis missions to land on the Moon again and ultimately journey to Mars. (On camera):  I think for most people who watch space programs that since the end of the space shuttle program that space travel has become the game of billionaires and the wealthy who travel to the edges of space. Why is this so important? VICTOR GLOVER, NASA ASTRONAUT:  One aspect of human space exploration is that it unites, and it lifts. I love, you keep using that word, Jeremy, lifts. It lifts people up and it pushes you to do things that seem impossible. REID WISEMAN, NASA ASTRONAUT:  When you go out and do something that pushes the boundaries, you always learn things that you didn't expect to learn. And we will have breakthroughs left and right. It's going to be phenomenal. LAVANDERA:  It's been more than a half century since astronauts returned to the moon Apollo 8 astronauts were the first to see the surface up close. Their mission and films captivated the world. The voices of astronauts beamed back to Earth, felt like science fiction. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good luck, a Merry Christmas and God bless all of you. LAVANDERA:  Christina Koch kept this iconic image of the Earthrise taken by that first crew in 1968 on her bedroom wall as a little girl. The Artemis 2 crew is making history by putting the first person of color and a woman on a lunar mission. KOCH:  It's an honor to be a part of this program at a time when we as an organization, as a country, have recognized and decided that it's important to go for all and by all. LAVANDERA:  When you see the Earth rise for the first time, have you thought about what that moment is going to be like? JEREMY HANSEN, NASA ASTRONAUT:  I think it's going to be pretty emotional. I'm going to be seeing that image with three friends. We're going to be in a tiny capsule. I think there's going to be some hugging. LAVANDERA:  Do you think in our lifetimes we will see somebody landing on Mars? HANSEN:  I do. GLOVER:  I certainly hope so. WISEMAN:  I think we will get there in our lifetime. To think that humans will be walking on Mars in 20 years is completely reasonable. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For our next story, we're headed to Jamaica Mon, to give a 10 out of 10 to an Olympic champion sprinter that isn't taken a single day off, not even at our son's sports day at school. 36-year-old Shelly-Ann Fraser- Pryce, leaving all the other parents in the dust, reminding everyone that she's the third fastest woman of all time. Now, Fraser-Pryce's speed has carried her to eight Olympic medals, three of them gold, as well as ten world titles.  And I actually got to interview her after she won gold at the Tokyo Summer Olympics. She told me she used to run to school every day as a kid, barefoot because she couldn't afford shoes. She told me she runs today to inspire all the youngsters out there, letting them know that even if you don't come from privilege, you can reach your greatness someday, too. All right, now, random thought Thursday question was how much dirt is in a hole that measures two inches by three inches by four inches? Well, the answer is none, lovely people. It's a whole great job with all of the Your Word Wednesday submissions. Thanks to Madison Westerhoff from Cashion Oklahoma. Today's vocabulary word was hullabaloo, a noun meaning a commotion or a fuss. Now, before I go, we want to give a special shout out Winfield, Kansas, Winfield Middle School. We see you lovely people. We're going to be off the air next week for spring break. But I will see you right back here tomorrow, sending you all some good vibes today. I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10. END230407

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. So happy to be hanging out with you on the absolute best day of the week. It's Friday and it has been an awesome week, sharing, learning, we had some laughs. Let's finish this week strong.  We're going to start today by heading to the Middle East in the country of Iraq, where a team of experts trying to piece together damaged historical artifacts after the Islamic militant group ISIS destroyed them in the city of Mosul.  Here's video from 2015, where the Islamic State militants were smashing and destroying ancient artifacts at the Mosul Museum. Some of these statues were thousands of years old, all of them demolished.  The reasoning behind this was part of a campaign by this terror group to topple and dissolve any cultural history that conflicted with their extreme beliefs and ideology. For three years, ISIS had control of Mosul, Iraq's second largest city. But Iraqi forces, with the help of the U.S.-led coalition, reclaimed the city in 2017 and defeated the extremist group's rule. But the damage was already done. So for years, experts have been in reconstruction mode, looking to restore the city's proud history. Our Michael Holmes has more on this Mosul Museum restoration project in Iraq.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The fragmented artifacts in the Mosul Museum have been under repair by a team of Iraqi and French restoration experts for the past four years. They say it is a painstaking process to try to repair the shattered antiquities, a jigsaw puzzle of pieces that might never quite fit together again.  One restorer says this is the most gratifying part, assembling and gluing the pieces. Although some are too crushed to use, others are missing altogether.  The museum is just one of many ongoing rebuilding projects in Mosul. In March, church bells rang out again in another part of the city, part of a UNESCO effort to rebuild churches and mosques destroyed by decades of fighting in Iraq. Since 2018, UNESCO has raised more than $105,000,000 for reconstruction efforts in Mosul.  AUDREY AZOULAY, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, UNESCO:  Mosul is the place where UNESCO has the largest commitment today in the world because the city deserve it, because the people of Mosul deserve it, because we know what they've been through and the tragedies, the intimate tragedies they've been through over the last decades.  HOLMES:  Another project is taking a more modern approach to maintaining the city's heritage. The Ion Mosul Foundation is recording videos of witness testimonies of what life was like under ISIS rule, which will then be archived in the public library.  A common theme of the projects is to rebuild as well as remember. But the Director of the Mosul Museum says it is impossible to recreate what happened here without any scratches or imperfections. But those two are now part of Mosul's history.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia.  What is the name given to the second full moon in a calendar month?  Pink moon, Blue moon, Blood moon, or Harvest moon? Once in a blue moon, we get two full moons in one-month, which typically occurs once every two or three years.  Now, while we didn't see a blue moon last night, the April pink moon was shining brightly instead, even though, despite its name, it doesn't appear shining pink, the bright golden orb is still something special of which to take notice in the nighttime sky. The pink moon is a nod to the bountiful blooming flowers and trees that the spring weather brings. Our CNN Meteorologist Jennifer Gray has more on the origins of the nicknames of moons.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JENNIFER GRAY, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Many of the Moon's nicknames date back to the early Native Americans. They named each full moon in every month to help them keep track of their planting and harvesting schedule.  The full moon in April is known as the Pink Moon, signaling the first appearance of the wild ground flocks, one of the earliest spring flowers. When you have two full Moons in a calendar month, the second one is called the Blue Moon. One of the more notable Moons, the harvest moon in October, also known as the Hunter's Moon or the Blood Moon. This is when the leaves are falling off the trees and the animals are fat. So this signaled to tribes it was time to hunt all they could to get them through that long winter.  And another thing to note is that the Moon does not appear pink during the pink moon, red during the blood moon, or blue during the blue moon. The only thing that can really alter the way we see the moon is if there's a lot of dust, haze, ash or smoke in the atmosphere, the moon can sometimes have an orange or red glow.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For our next story, we're going north of the border to Canada, where I'm given a 10 out of 10 to a canine romance story that's doggone adorable. During the pandemic, two fur babies named Rollo and Sadie met when their fur parents moved next to each other. It was love at first sight. But after two years of bonding, times got rough when one of the owners had to move three hours away. Well, that didn't stop these long-distance doggy romantics from seeing each other. Our Jeanne Moos has the story of the Romeo and Juliet of the dog world.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  When's the last time someone was this excited to see you after a separation? Meet Rollo and Sadie. Watch them meet after being apart and check out their faces when they FaceTime.  This is the video that had viewers howling. Sadie, a husky and German shepherd cross, and Rollo, a Rottweiler shepherd mix, met during the pandemic when their owners moved into different apartments in the same house in the Canadian city of Edmonton.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Sadie's never really been the biggest fan of other dogs, but when she met Rollo, she whined and cried and laid down on her back like she just met the love of her life.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Every time they see each other, he goes insane.  MOOS:  But then Rollo's owner moved three hours away for a job opportunity.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And we do FaceTime every Thursday night. So the dogs can see each other?  MOOS:  The whining, the howling. Their reunions are joyous and their owners are also best friends. They say there's a chance they'll all move back under the same roof, but until then. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That's your buddy, isn't it? Yeah, that's your buddy.  MOOS:  During our remote interview, it was more sound than sight that set them off. He began looking for her, headed for the window. Rollo and Sadie are the Romeo and Juliet of dogs. For never was a story of more woe than this of Sadie and her Rollo, parting may be such sweet sorrow, but reunions are a ball.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Round of applause for that one. Those stories give me a little verklempt, though, because we're going to miss you. Next week, we're going to be off the air because our hardworking CNN team has their much-deserved spring break.  Our final shout out this week goes to Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Manitowoc Lincoln High School, we see you, rise up.  One more thing as you chase your dreams, there are going to be people who tell you that you can't. They'll say you're not good enough or it isn't possible. And sometimes maybe you'll start to doubt yourself or you won't see a clear path to your goal at times. But no matter what you're going through, just keep going, outwork everyone, every single day and believe in you. You are more powerful than you know.  I'm Coy Wire. We are CNN 10. It's been a blessing to spend this week with you. END230410

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello everyone, I'm Coy Wire. Thankful to be back with you this Monday, April 17, with a special edition of CNN 10. One that reminds us that no matter our differences we have to respect and show love for one another and we must denounce hate in all its forms whenever we see it. On the Jewish calendar tonight at sundown is the start of Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day. The event commemorates the 6 million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust by the Nazis during World War II and celebrates the lives of those who survived. The Nazi party led by Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, and a core element of their ideology was anti-Semitism or hostility and prejudiced against Jewish people.  Under Nazi rule, Jews were deprived of nearly all of their rights. They were forced from their homes sent to areas known as Ghettos, with substandard conditions and then ultimately, to facilities all across Europe known as concentration camps. This drone video is of Auschwitz, the largest of those concentration camps, which still stands today as a memorial and museum. The conditions in these camps were brutal and horrific. Jewish prisoners were given little food and water were forced to work day and night. Some were deemed unfit to work and were killed immediately in facilities intentionally made for murder.  By the end of the war, nearly two out of every three European Jews were killed as part of what Nazi Germany called the final solution. After the concentration camps were liberated in 1945. The world vowed to never forget. We'll hear now from one Holocaust survivor Edith Gross, who shares her incredible story of survival with CNN. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Edith Gross is a survivor. She beat unimaginable odds, endured the horrors of the Holocaust and lived to tell her story. EDITH GROSS:  In 1944, we heard that the Nazis are coming. And I remember we went to Main Street we were watching when they came in. And they were so tall. And their boots were so shiny. They marched into the city. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Edith was 15 years old living in occupied Czechoslovakia with her older sister and brothers. Her mother had died and father had left for America when she was two. GROSS:  In the first week, we had to wear a yellow star. If you didn't put it on and you were caught they killed you right away. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  As the Nazi grip on the country tightened Jews were forced into Ghettos and not allowed to run businesses. GROSS:  They decided my house, where I lived happened to fall in the ghetto so I didn't have to move. But they put in, I don't know, maybe two or three families. It got so crowded, there barely was room to sleep on the floor even. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Then, they were taken to concentration camps. GROSS:  They told us pack everything you can you can carry and you have to leave everything behind. On the train the conditions was unbelievable. A little pail was in the middle of the cattle car and that was our bathroom. And there were children. There were women. And no privacy of any sort. There was barely room to lie down. And we went for days. It seems like for years. It was a nightmare, terrible. But finally arrived in Birkenau-  Auschwitz. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Many did not even survive the journey to the camps. GROSS:  When we arrived we did see a smoking crematorium and the smell was terrible. They said leave everything and get off. I remember lining up and walking from the train into Auschwitz and there sat Mengele with a little stick in his hand first for women and then for men. And he directed the people. This was went to work and this way went to the crematorium. The women were lining up. I ran over to my brother and I gave him a big hug. And I could see his eyes. He was so frightened. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Edith managed to follow her sister to the line. She never saw her brother again. After Auschwitz, Edith and her sister were moved to a forced labor camp. GROSS:  It was very, very hard labor. And there was a quota. And my sister always had back pain so I was very first. I was made sure that I've made a quota. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  As the Russians began to close in on their location, the Nazis moved them again, this time to Stutthof concentration camp. GROSS:  Five o'clock every morning, they woke us up. We had to line up. Every time person was pushed out. And of course, we knew never to see them again. Waking us up during the night, and watching somebody being hung. Stutthof was a very, very rough place. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Edith sister became very ill. Her condition deteriorated rapidly. GROSS:  I remember she was on the other side of electric wire and I was yelling, Dwartija (my sister's name). I wanted a last glance because I knew we were never going to see each other again. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The Nazis becoming desperate amidst Russian advances started forcing the Jews on so called Death Marches. GROSS:  We didn't have any warm clothes of course, and no food, no nothing. And we started to march. People would just bend down, they were shot. If you just did anything, or you spoke, or anything they were shot. We were walking, dead, all over dead all around us. The German, as we walked through the towns, came out to look at the zoo animals. We looked like zoo animals, dirty. And nothing. But nobody throwed us food. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They marched from Stutthof to Danzig, finally reaching Konigsberg, now known as Kaliningrad in Russia, where they were liberated by Russian troops. GROSS:  Russian tanks arrived but we were very lucky because the Russians were very, very good liberators. Right away they had a hospital. Right away there was food, although we couldn't eat. Our stomachs were so shrunk. And they said to us, "You are liberated." UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Edith slowly made her way back to Czechoslovakia.  GROSS:  When we got to the house where we live in it was taken apart brick by brick.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  With nothing left for her in her hometown, Edith made the journey over many months to try to leave Europe. GROSS:  I didn't want to go to America. I wanted to go to Israel. I wanted to live amongst Jews because I was so, with the antisemitism I said I have to live with Jews. And that's when my father was able to get in touch with me through the Red Cross. We waited eight months for the visa. In those days it wasn't like now. Roosevelt didn't want the Jews to come here he displaced Jews, even after the war. So I decided I will come to America.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So she enrolled in school and learned English. Now Edith has seven grandchildren and eight great grandchildren. Today is more and more Holocaust survivors pass away. Edith makes it her mission to continue to tell her story. RABBI SHIMON STILLERM, CHABAD OF ISLIP TOWNSHIP:  Since she started speaking she must have reached directly a few 1000 students and community members, residents and probably indirectly a lot more than that. She was someone who experienced the worst evil in the world. She works to bring light to other people in her surroundings. That's what Judaism is all about. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  She says if she only changes one mind, she's accomplished something. GROSS:  Stop hate and take people the way they are. You know, and judge people what they are. Not by religion, not by any color. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Through the Chabad organization in the town of Islip, Long Island, a community center was dedicated in Edith's honor. She recently took a trip to Israel where she visited the Western Wall and Yad Vashem the Holocaust Memorial. Though it has been 80 years since that horrible time, all that she is lost will always remain. GROSS:  When I hear holocaust survivors saving I'll forgive and forget. No, there is no such a thing. I will never forget, forgive and definitely not forget. (END VIDEO CLIP) END230418

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up lovely people. It's Tuesday time to shine, hope you're ready to rock and fuel your mind. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. Let's get informed and uplifted with the best 10 minutes in news. We're going to start today with the latest news on the suspect in a recent leak of classified Pentagon documents posted on social media. On Friday, in federal court in Boston, Jack Teixeira, a former airman of the Massachusetts Air National Guard was charged under the Espionage Act for the unauthorized retention and transmission of National Defense Information as well as the removal of classified materials. According to court documents, Teixeira worked as a low-ranking I.T. official and held top secret security clearance. He allegedly posted about the documents online in December and shared photos of them in January. Detailed intelligence assessments were among the leaked U.S. documents. Now CNN has reviewed some of them and they contain a wide array of highly classified information such as info from eavesdropping on important allies and adversaries as well as evaluations on the status of the Ukraine war. CNN Pentagon Correspondent Oren Liebermann has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  In a federal courtroom in Boston, 21-year-old, Jack Teixeira, faced his legal fate for the first time charged through the Espionage Act with unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents and national security information. The Airman First Class at the center of an investigation into a leak of top-secret information. In court, his father yelled out, "Love you, Jack." The response, "Love you to, Dad." UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you surprise by this? LIEBERMANN:  Outside the courthouse, Teixeira's family thrust into the spotlight with national security interests at stake said nothing. Teixeira was an I.T. specialist with the Massachusetts Air National Guard. He enlisted before graduating high school. His senior year photo had a quote that now appears prophetic, actions speak louder than words. He's had a top-secret clearance since 2021. And access to sensitive compartmentalized information in a job that requires a lifetime binding nondisclosure agreement. MERRICK GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL:  People who sign agreements to be able to receive classified documents acknowledge the importance to the national security of not disclosing those documents, and we intend to send that message how important it is to our national security. LIEBERMANN:  One day earlier at one hour south, Teixeira was spotted on his back porch reading a book, moments later the FBI tactical team closed in on Teixeira taking him into custody outside his house. On Discord, an online platform frequently used by gamers, Teixeira built his own group of friends and followers. Court documents allege that late last year he began sharing classified information, a user in the chat group telling the FBI at first it was just paragraphs of text and then photographs of documents that contained what appeared to be classification markings. ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST:  The fact is, it's quite easy to do if you are a person who has decided to violate your oath, to violate the training and the rules that you operate under and to proactively make a decision to break the law. LIEBERMANN:  In the days before his arrest, court documents say Teixeira used his government computer to search classified intelligence reporting for the word leak on attempt to find out if investigators were on to him. (On camera): After Teixeira's first court appearance on Friday, he'll have a detention hearing on Wednesday. This whole legal process it seems moving forward very quickly. About a week from when President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and others first learned about the leaks to the arrest and the prosecution now moving forward for Jack Teixeira. Oren Liebermann, CNN at the Pentagon. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia. Where did Napoleon Bonaparte crown himself emperor of the French? Arc de Triomphe, Palace of Versailles, Champs-Elysees or Notre Dame Cathedral? Napoleon was at Notre Dame in 1804 when he took the crown from Pope Pius VII and placed it on his head by himself. Notre Dame, an 860-year-old Cathedral in Paris is one of the most iconic churches in the world, but a massive blaze in 2019 destroyed large parts of the relic including its idyllic spire and its roof which collapsed as firefighters battled the blaze. The roof had been said to be made of a forest because of the acres and acres worth of trees that were made into beams to build it. But Notre Dame is being rebuilt now. Let's meet up with CNN Senior International Correspondent Jim Bittermann in Paris to see how this majestic monument is coming along. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It was the most haunting image of a sickening afternoon. The spire of Notre Dame crashing through the cathedral roof as flames burned all around. In the four years since as giant oaks have been felled, and the ashes cleared away, shock and dismay has turned to confidence that the spire and the cathedral will rise again. And soon, if you believe, the general, who President Emmanuel Macron put in charge of rebuilding the monument. GENERAL JEAN-LOUIS GEORGELIN, FRENCH ARMY GENERAL IN CHARGE OF RESTORATION: The President say we will rebuild this cathedral in five years, is the world's (inaudible) and reputation of France is at stake. BITTERMANN: The General wants the Chief of Staff of the French army went to visit an extraordinary woodshop in eastern France to inspect how the work is going. Here carpenters are moving around tons of oak like children's building blocks to rebuild the spire that collapsed as well as the rest of the cathedrals roof beams which were destroyed in the fire, cutting and fitting, precise down to the millimeter. (On camera):  Well, much care and effort and money are being expended to make sure the reconstructed Notre Dame is just like the old one. The workers who are working on these giant pieces of wood say they are sometimes amazed at how they could have done all this 1000 years ago. (Voice-over):  One person who's had a better view than most of the Notre Dame reconstruction is photographer Tomas Van Houtryve. His photos are going up along the walls of the Notre Dame worksite. He began taking pictures of the cathedral long before the fire, sometimes using an ancient wooden camera as old as the iconic spire itself. Van Houtryve was then commissioned to document the Working side by National Geographic and the French establishment charged with the Notre Dame restoration and preservation. As the monument slowly rose again from the ashes, he emotionally recorded the work inside and outside. TOMAS VAN HOUTRYVE, PHOTOGRAPHER:  When you're inside Notre Dame, you feel something. It's a place of reverence. And when you're inside it, and you see it and it's damaged to stay, you feel something even more. I mean, it goes straight to your heart. BITTERMANN:  Van Houtryve has watched firsthand, as not only the damage from the fire was cleared away, but as well centuries of grime that had accumulated before the fire. In some ways he believes the newly restored Notre Dame will be even better than what was there before. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  What would you do if you were outside having some lunch or sipping some coffee and a motorized robotic trash can just wrote up on you and started staring at you with this little camera lens? Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is about a recent study in the streets of New York that found while robot trash cans promoted social interaction and encouraged recycling. Some folks weren't about it at all. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Come here, buddy. Thank you. Good job. WENDY JU, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, CORNELL TECH:  When we did this project, we were actually hoping to roboticized chairs and tables literally our partners, you know, and the business improvement district said, are you kidding? It's New York, you have to do trash. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Oh, good boy. Oh, there you go, good boy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's recycling. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, it's recycling. Oh, you are. You are a bad boy. You don't know what you're doing. Yeah, it's OK. They're learning. It still helps. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's creepy. That's just freaking creepy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah. ILAN MANDEL, PH.D STUDENT, CORNELL TECH: We're not trying to sell a trash robot, we're trying to understand how people interact with robot objects. Before we do the deployment, we watch how the people who clean the streets actually do their work. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There you go. MANDEL: The work they do is incredibly nuanced and difficult and very unlikely to be automatable without completely restructuring the infrastructure of the street. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What does he want? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That cup bro. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I will give you my straw. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  What say you about robotic trash cans? Robots or no bots? I want to thank all of you who've subscribed and commented on our CNN 10 YouTube channel. Our special shout out is going to Godley, Texas today. Godley High School rise up. I also want to give a special hello to Mr. Moore from David T. Howard Middle School. It was nice meeting you at the Dogwood Festival in Atlanta last weekend. Keep crushing that tennis game and remember outwork everyone every single day. I'll see you tomorrow everyone. I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10. END230419

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up lovely people, hope you're ready to make this a wonderful Wednesday. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. It's also your word Wednesday, follow me at Coy Wire on instant Snapchat and TikTok and put your unique vocabulary word in the comments section of my most recent posts, and we're going to choose one winner to work into tomorrow's show. Let's go. We start with the soon to be most populated nation in the world. You know what it is? India. India and China each actually have more than 1.4 billion people making up more than a third of the world's population. And while China currently sits in the top spot population, experts predict that India will soon surpass them if it hasn't already happened. China has been the most populous country since at least 1950. The year that the United Nations began collecting population data. But families in China have been having fewer children and there have been more deaths there each year than births. That could mean that in the coming years, China might face challenges supporting its aging population due to a declining working age population. In India, however, there is a younger population and there are higher national fertility rates and a decrease in infant mortality. These are some of the factors that have contributed to population growth. Experts are having a difficult time making a clear projection on exactly when India's population might overtake China's in part because China had a recent census in 2020 while India's last census was 2011. Let's learn more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER:  India's birth rate has slowed, but the country is still quickly adding to its 1.4 billion strong population. (On camera): According to UNICEF, more than 67,300 babies are born in India every day. That's 1/6 of the world's wealth counts daily. (Voice-over): Already more than half of all Indians are under the age of 30. That means a huge potential to grow the national economy, but education and investment need to keep up if there are going to be jobs for a new generation. India's new global title will mean little if it doesn't come with fresh opportunity. Vedika Sud, CNN, New Delhi. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next, we're headed to the west coast where Mother Nature has brought about the return of a massive lake which hadn't existed for generations, California's Central Valley has been overwhelmed with rain which has flooded hundreds of square miles of farmland, ruining crops and livelihoods. And the scary part is it could get worse. CNN's Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir reminds us that water never forgets. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT:  In California Central Valley farmers have spent much of the last 20 years praying for rain. But then came this winter of relentless rivers in the sky, enough to bring a long dead lake back to life and drought over 150 square miles of farmland and counting. So now, they pray for the water to stop. (On camera): It is mind blowing to realize that if you'd stood here for the last couple of generations, he'd be watching the sunset over dusty fields of cotton or alfalfa or pistachio trees. And now it is waterfront property. I had no idea Tulare Lake was once the biggest freshwater body west of the Mississippi, but it was dammed and dived and drained to build a $2 billion agriculture industry. And now it's back. It's proof that water never forgets. And this may just be the beginning because behind those clouds over there, the Sierra Nevadas are so packed with snow, 260% above normal, and sooner or later that's going to melt which is only going to make this flooding worse and last longer. The last time it flooded this dramatically here was 1983 and it took two years to dry out. You were telling me about the effects in '83? SIDONIO PALMERIN, COUNCIL MEMBER, CITY OF CORCORAN: Yes. WEIR:  The town hollowed out pretty much? PALMERIN:  Yes.  I was in a school board at that time in 1983 and we lost half our school population. About 1/3 of our city's population and a lot of the people that were fewer workers lost their homes or cars. WEIR:  And this time, in addition to the dripping time bomb in the mountains, Corcoran has many feet lower in elevation. After years of over pumping groundwater to grow thirstier crops, made this one of the fastest sinking areas in the nation. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The levee that we're standing on is called the Corcoran levee. It's a 14.5-mile levee that protects the city of Corcoran, the two state prisons. The residents here are about 22,000 residents and about 8000 inmates. And so, the work behind us that you'll see over here with the tractor work in the distance. They're actually building the levee up another four to five feet. God willing, that'll protect the city of Corcoran. WEIR:  There's a race against the melt. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That's exactly right. WEIR:  Basically happened, right? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, we've been fortunate with a very slow, mild spring so far, but we know the heats coming. MARTINA SEALY, CORCORAN RESIDENT:  All of the crops are completely flooded and ruined. So that it takes a lot of jobs from people. That's a lot of foods that provide -- we provide for, now California and all around the nation. It's pretty scary. WEIR:  And unfortunately, this is just the beginning, right? Because -- SEALY:  Very beginning. WEIR:  The big melt hasn't even really begun? SEALY:  Yes, this is just from the rain. This no mounts, there's nowhere for it to go besides, here, you know? WEIR:  So, Tulare Lake is back for a while? SEALY:  Yeah. It's back and it may take over and put us out. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  10 second trivia. What planet is closest to Earth when it passes by? Mercury, Venus, Mars or Jupiter? WIRE:  It might not be the closest on average, but Venus's orbit brings it closer to Earth than any other planet. Next up, the launch of the most powerful rocket ever built, its name starship. SpaceX is now targeting Thursday for the next attempt to launch the rocket. The first launch attempt scheduled for Monday was delayed due to a technical issue. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk says the starship is key to his mission of getting the first humans to Mars. CNN Senior National Correspondent Ed Lavandera has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The SpaceX starship is the most powerful rocket ever built. It's 400 feet tall. The super heavy booster is packed with 33 engines, and it will attempt to push the uncrewed starship spacecraft which sits on top of the rocket booster into space. If the rocket launches properly, the spacecraft will separate less than three minutes into the flight and travel east from South Texas and go much of the way around the earth before splashing into the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. But hours before this scheduled launch SpaceX founder Elon Musk worked to lower expectations to the point that he seemed to be bracing for catastrophic failure. ELON MUSK, SPACEX FOUNDER & CEO:  Success is not what should be expected. That would be insane. This vehicle could make it all the way to little bit or it may blow up on the pad. There's a million ways this rocker could fail. LAVANDERA:  SpaceX has waited more than a year for the final government clearance to launch this rocket. The starship rocket system is the centerpiece of Musk goal of commercial space travel to the moon and beyond, to Mars. It comes two weeks after NASA unveiled the four astronauts who will fly around the moon next year as part of the Space Agency's Artemis Mission. NASA has awarded SpaceX contracts and options of more than $3 billion dollars to use starship to ferry future Artemis astronauts to the moon and NASA Artemis 2 commander Reid Wiseman spoke with CNN about the importance of this partnership for humans to eventually reach Mars. REID WISEMAN, NASA ASTRONAUT:  I think we will get there. The amount of private-public partnerships going on SpaceX is building our lander for the moon. They're working on starship right now. We have commercial space is just doing amazing things right now. So, to think that humans will be walking on Mars in 20 years is completely reasonable. LAVANDERA:  Testing on this rocket system started several years ago, and it's resulted in many breakthroughs. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Two, one, ignition, abort. LAVANDERA:  But also, some explosive setbacks. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10, some creative students from the Colorado School of Mines, a research university focused on science and engineering. It's the annual cardboard boat race in Golden Colorado where these creative students devise a master plan to build the fastest baldest boat using only cardboard and some duct tape. It's wild. It's wacky, it's slippery. Watch out lady. Now, some of these boats are tricked out to check out the dragon head on this one. These students are competitive and as one of them says. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're nerds that like the party. WIRE:  Loads of spectators cheering them on as they race on their raft and hope to make it past the rapids. But when they don't, it's nothing to feel bad a boat. This is the best cardboard sport I've seen since boxing. Heyo, time for my favorite part of the day. Now, I want to give a special shout out to Wilmington, Delaware, Delaware Military Academy, we see you. Fun fact, Delaware is the second smallest state but outranks five states in terms of population, including Alaska, which is the largest state in the United States. Thanks for watching everyone. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10. END230420

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello everyone. It's Coy Wire. Welcome to a new look Thursday. Or as I like to say, happy Friday eve. We are almost to the end of the week, so let's lock in and finish this week strong. The best 10 minutes of news starts right now.  We begin our journey today by traveling to the Sudan Africa, where a conflict is currently taking place between two groups. One is the Sudanese Armed forces. The other is the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, which is a paramilitary group.  Not long ago, the commanders of these two factions were partners. In 2019, they worked together to overthrow Sudan's dictator Omar al-Bashir, who ruled the country for three decades. Afterwards, the two groups worked together to share power until now.  The conflicts between the two groups erupted this month after failed negotiations over integrating the groups and the distribution of power between the generals. Now, the RSF is attempting to capture the army headquarters, leading to intense clashes and significant loss of life.  Many hospitals are also not open despite the urgent requirement for medical aid. Since the fighting started, nearly 300 people have been killed, more than 3,000 injured. Despite calls for a truce during continuous fighting for five days, the violence has not stopped.  Several countries are attempting to evacuate their citizens, but closed airports have hindered those efforts, resulting in very little success. More now from CNN International Correspondent Larry Madowo.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Two generals at war. Since Saturday, the forces of General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as a Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group, or RSF, have been locked in battle with the Sudanese Army lead by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. The fighting comes as Sudan tries to finalize a deal to return to civilian rule after two military coups in recent years which temporarily united the army and the RSF. In a phone interview, Dagalo, who is better known as Hemeti told me ruling Sudan isn't his endgame.  (On camera): What do you personally want from this situation, General Hamdan? Do you want to lead the army? Do you want to be the chief? GENERAL MOHAMED HAMDAN DAGALO, LEADER OF PARAMILITARY RAID SUPPORTER FORCES (through translator):  I don't want to be the leader of the army. There's a framework agreement between all the Sudanese stakeholders that should be adhered to. I don't want to lead anything. These are all propaganda they are making.  MADOWO:  As part of the agreement, the RSF, some 100,000 strong, would merge with the army, but differences over how long that would take and who would end up with more power aggravated tensions between the two factions, which have since erupted into open warfare. Residential areas across Sudan have become battlefields with antiaircraft weapons in the streets and warplanes hovering overhead.  (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COREY ADKINS, GREAT LAKES SHIPWRECK HISTORICAL SOCIETY:  When you find a ship that hasn't been seen in about 109 years, that's quite exciting. It helps us put the story together for history. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Well, look what we have here. The Stanley Cup, it's the championship trophy awarded each year to the winner of the National Hockey League. The trophy itself is the oldest trophy still competed for in North America.  And unlike other major sports that make a new trophy each year, this one is one of a kind. And players on the winning team, they get their names engraved on the trophy. But just like your English papers, there are a few mistakes.  Over the years, several players and teams have been spelled incorrectly on the cup. Oops. But some fans say this actually adds to the authenticity of the trophy. Try using that excuse in English class. Now, that's random.  Now come along with me and meet one of our CNN heroes, Dr. Kwane Stewart, a veterinarian who founded a nonprofit called Project Street Vet. It helps to provide medical care to the pets of people experiencing homelessness.  As part of his mission, Dr. Stewart has provided free treatment to thousands of pets living in the streets. We'll hear what inspired him to grow his mission and about his personal journey to become a vet.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. KWANE STEWART, PROJECT STREET VET:  I've seen people give up their last meal for their pet and people who have $3 for their name. And after I'm done with the treatment, they will try and give me that $3.  This is your partner? Obviously. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's my best friend.  STEWART:  I can treat about 80 percent of the cases I see out of a really small bag.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Well, you do vaccines, too?  STEWART:  We do vaccines? She needed them.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, that's really cool.  STEWART:  It's antibiotics. It's anti-inflammatories, flea and tick heartworm prevention. It's all there.  Let me take a listen here.  It doesn't matter what your situation is or what your back runner past is. I see a pet in need, and I see a person who cares for them dearly, who just needs some help.  I'm going to do it right here. It's at no cost to them. It's free. That's it, buddy.  I've been carrying this dream since I was seven. And it was that movie The Black Stallion that did it for me, seeing that majestic black horse and the relationship with the boy. And I remember walking out holding my mom's hand. I said, when I grow up, I want to be an animal doctor. The moment I graduated vet school and got my first job, it was great. Finally climbed the mountain, seeing animals every day, learning new things.  I was Chief Medical Officer of a regional national chain. But then I went into shelter medicine. I moved from Southern California up to Northern California to take that job. And a lot of people are just trying to survive.  That was the cold water in the face wake up call. Guys are so cute. It was during the recession, so I'm seeing hordes of unwanted pets dropped off, people who don't have the money to feed them or care for them medically. I started getting a little despondent and depressed.  One day in particular, I just thought about leaving the veterinary professional together. On this day, I stopped in at 711. As I was walking out with my coffee, I looked to my left, and I saw an unhoused gentleman with his dog. I'd seen this guy before, regrettably just walked by him. And on this day, I just broke pattern because I noticed his dog. And this dog looked like a burn victim, looked like a flea problem. Fleas can just destroy the skin.  I said, I'll be back tomorrow with something that I think will help. I returned his promise. It was $3 out of my pocket. Five more minutes of my time, and the dog was just transformed. That was the moment. That's when I said to myself, I'm going to do more of this. I'm going to get back to saving animals on my terms, and I'm going to do it for passion, not for pay. It was a feeling I'd never had before.  I'm building a network of trusted volunteers, technicians, but hospitals and clinics we can go to, we can call on.  Everything looks OK.  But spreading across the country. And I have teams popping up in Orlando and Atlanta, D.C.  She's beautiful.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes. STEWART:  You know, that's the dream now. Street vet team in every major urban center in the country.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is BMX athlete Kriss Kyle, who had a sky-high dream of creating a skate park 2,000 feet in the air by hanging it from one of the world's largest hot air balloons. Here's Kriss. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KRISS KYLE, BMX RIDER:  Members daydreaming looking out at the sky, and I was like, oh, my God. Imagine just floating, a skate park in the sky. And then I put it down in my notes, my phone, got home, sketched up some stick men, and sent it to my red bull manager. Yeah. So the whole thing took around three years from start to finish.  It was long, and to be honest I thought it'd be easy. I thought it was just going to be literally tying the bull to the hot air balloon and just floating up and it'd be easy, but I quickly realized that it was a lot harder than what I could ever expected.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Now, the project took three years to master from start to finish, but he pulled it off, and he was able to pull off stunts like this on a bike way high up in the sky. Kriss' training for this was intense, but the biggest challenge, he says, was conquering his own fear.  Imagine how discombobulated you'd probably feel doing all those twists and turns while your stomach is probably twisting and turning all in its own right. This 10 out of 10 is a great reminder, whenever you're chasing a goal and feeling a psychological barrier, just keep pedaling, even if you're wheelie scared.  We had some great your word Wednesday submissions yesterday. Thanks to today's winner @bucksburgundy (ph) from Auburn, New York for discombobulated. Did you hear it in the show? It's an adjective meaning confused. Well done.  Our special shout out today is going to Vernon, New Jersey, Vernon Township High School, go Vikings. Horns up and horns forward. Remember, happiness isn't some ideal we have to chase or find or create. Happiness is right here, right now, whenever we choose to embrace it. Much love, many blessings.  I'm Coy Wire. We are CNN 10.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, sunshine? Happy Friday. Let's unleash our full potential. Take great energy, good vibes, and lots of love into this weekend and make it a feel, good Friday. Remember, what's within influences, what happens without.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start with fishermen in Japan. Bracing after the government's recent decision to gradually release more than a million tons of filtered wastewater from a toxic nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean. The government says it's necessary.  In the Fukushima Prefecture in 2011, a disastrous earthquake and tsunami followed by a nuclear meltdown, devastated this region of Japan. Dangerous radioactive particles from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant contaminated the environment as radiation seeped into the sea, leading authorities to prohibit fishing in several regions off the coast of Japan for more than a year. These areas had previously supplied 50 percent of the country's fish.  Even after the ban was lifted, though, Fukushima based fishermen were mostly limited to collecting only samples for radioactivity tests. Now, more than a decade later, the ocean currents have dispersed the contaminated water, and radioactivity is undetectable. Many felt the nightmare was over, but now some fishermen who make a living in this region say they feel betrayed. And safe or not, dumping contaminated water into the ocean will be devastating to their reputations and livelihoods. CNN Correspondent Marc Stewart has more.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's just after 9:00 in the morning. The crew of this ship is back in port at the Ohama Fishing Village in Fukushima, Japan. Kinzaburo Shiga is a third-generation fisherman starting in elementary school, going on trips with his father.  He told me he's happy on the boat, but he faces challenges. His catch is tested for radiation. That's because the port is around 40 miles from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. In 2011, there was a meltdown here after a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami.  For six years, he couldn't fix fish, told to stay off the water. When he heard he couldn't fish, he was sad, disappointed. The ocean was off limits.  (On camera): Twelve years later, fishermen face yet another challenge. Treated wastewater that accumulated inside the plant will soon be released into the ocean, a threat to their reputation and way of life.  (Voice-over): He says the decision made his blood boil. He wonders why the government made the decision without the consent of the fishermen.  At the time, the Prime Minister said it had to be done to decommission the plant. We wanted to see the plant for ourselves, and we were allowed to after agreeing to a strict safety protocol.  (On camera): This is as close as we can get to reactors one through four. The cleanup worked here will take at least 20 more years.  (Voice-over): We also saw a lab where fish are tested and lots of construction on the water treatment facility.  (On camera): Let me show you the tanks behind me, row after row, enough to fill about 500 Olympic swimming pools. The treated water will be let go gradually through a tunnel that will take it offshore and then eventually into the ocean.  (Voice-over): According to the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company, the water has been treated by taking out most of the radioactive particles. It's then diluted with seawater, taking it to a level much lower than the World Health Organization's clean drinking water standard.  And official from the utility told us he recognizes there's distrust because of the past, but they're listening to concerns. He knows not everyone will accept their plan, but points out the support they're getting from third parties such as the International Atomic Energy Agency. Still, neighboring countries have expressed concern.  (On camera): Is there a public health risk by releasing this water?  IAN FAIRLIE, INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT ON RADIOACTIVITY IN THE ENVIRONMENT: Yes, there is a public health risk. And it's relatively low, but the risk exists. I think that they should store the water so that it decays naturally.  STEWART (on camera):  While other options were considered, this was seen as the best plan as tanks near capacity. Japan's Pacific coast has been a point of pride and promise for fishermen like Kinzaburo.  He says he doesn't know what will happen, but hopes leaders won't work against the fishermen. The water release is expected to begin by the summer, bringing with it more years of anxiety and uncertainty.  (On camera): Despite everything that has happened, Japan still views nuclear power as part of its future. It's seen as a way to be energy independent. It's viewed as a greener energy source. And then on the topic of safety, the prime minister feels the next generation of plants will be safer.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia.  Which of these U.S. cities was named after the original capital of ancient Egypt?  Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, or Chattanooga? Most of the pyramids found near Cairo are located in what was Memphis, the first capital of ancient Egypt.  Come on with me now so we can put the umm in Memphis, Tennessee for today's story getting a 10 out of 10. Now, all of you, my dear friends, you know by now that I try to eat healthy most of the time. I love fitness, but sometimes I just feel like fitness entire burger into my mouth. Dyer's Burgers in Memphis, they say that they have the world-famous burger and the secret is floating it in grease. That's more than 100 years old. Go figure.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KENDALL ROBERTSON, OWNER, DYER'S BURGERS: Grease is seasoned and filtered every day, but it still has molecules from 1912 in the grease.  I'm Kendall Robertson, the owner of world-famous Dyer's on Beale in Memphis, Tennessee. We're famous for our grease. We cook all our burgers in grease. We season it filtered all the time, but it's still the same original grease.  Elmer "Doc" Dyer created Dyers in 1912 when it was on Cleveland Street in Memphis. The story goes that one day one of his employees forgot to empty out the frying pan the night before. He opened up and quickly got customers in and just started cooking burgers in the pan that had grease in it from the night before. And the customers were like, this is the best burger I've ever had in my life. And so Dyers was born. Dyers isn't like any other restaurant. We have no grill. We have no flat top. We just have a skillet full of grease.  LYRIC CRAWFORD, AKA "THE BURGER G", COOK, DYER'S BURGERS: My name is Lyric, also known as the Burger guy. I'll show you guys how to make a Dyer's burger. We ball the meat up into a little ball and we're going to use a wooden mallet. And a steel spatula to flatten them out.  The spatula is covered with grease, so that way the patty won't stick. All cooked the same. There's no medium, medium rare, any of that. They're all well done. And when they float, they're done. See how it's floating right here. Every bun comes with mustard, pickle and onion. Also black pepper at the bottom of it. That is the traditional Dyers burger. Dyers has a special seasoning, but I cannot tell you what that is.  And here comes the magic pan. This is what everyone comes to love to watch. As you can see, we'll put the cheese on top, make sure it gets good and gooey and melted. Gives it like a very buttery flavor when you bite into it. And then it's your first Dyer's burger. When you bite into it it's everything you've ever wanted in a hamburger. It's very simple, easy, quick. I've never had anybody try Dyer's burger that didn't truly love it.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  You all are the only buns for me. We're sending a special shout out to Laguna Hills, California New Vista School. What's up, lovely people. Thank you for taking the time to subscribe and comment on our CNN 10 YouTube Channel. And to those Mavericks from Mrs. Walton's class at Marvin Ridge Middle School in North Carolina. Rise up, keep shining bright y'all. Go on out and make someone smile today.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Time for motivation Monday. Have you ever heard of the story of the Chinese bamboo tree? Seed is planted and nothing happens for almost five years. After lots of watering and care, though, something amazing happens. It shoots up about 90 feet in five weeks, about three feet per day. So whenever you feel like you're not seeing any progress, just keep pushing, keep believing, and something magical just might happen.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start with the ongoing conflict in Sudan, Africa. On Saturday, President Joe Biden said that the United States government personnel and their families had been evacuated from the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum. The clashes between rival military groups there have become way too dangerous. So according to Defense Department officials, a group of more than 100 special operations forces made a fast and clean extraction, pulling out around 100 people from the war-torn country.  Battles between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, erupted earlier this month after failed negotiations in integrating the groups and over the distribution of power between the generals.  The World Health Organization reported Friday that 413 people had been killed, thousands more injured. U.S. officials say they'll continue efforts to bring an end to the violence and work to extend the ceasefire to which both sides agreed during a religious holiday, though there are reports that the fighting still continued during that time. CNN's Oren Liebermann has more.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  A successful mission carried out in the dark of night in Sudan to evacuate the U.S. embassy in Khartoum. According to U.S. officials, three Chinook helicopters took off from Djibouti some 750 or 800 miles away from Khartoum, flew into the country, landed, secured the embassy, and then brought out all of the embassy's staff and their family members, a group of just under a hundred people. U.S. officials said they do hope there's an opportunity here, a ceasefire that holds a resolution between the two warring parties there, and an opportunity to reopen the embassy. But that is an enormous question as the fighting there enters its second week.  The U.S. was looking for a window of opportunity, a ceasefire that holds essentially, to be able to evacuate the embassy itself. And the weekend brought that opportunity with the Eid al-Fitr Holiday. The two warring parties committed to the ceasefire, even though there were reports of violations of that ceasefire.  Now, a large question, what about all the U.S. nationals, the private citizens who remain in the country? And there are thousands of them. Oren Liebermann, CNN, at the Pentagon.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia.  Which of these locations in the Florida Keys translates to "purple island"? Key Largo, Key West, Islamorada, or Marathon? Islamorada is your answer here. It means purple island in Spanish. And this place is known as the Sportfishing Capital of the World. Healthy coral reefs are essential to a healthy marine ecosystem. Well, after watching coral reefs disappear over the 20 years he lived in Florida, one man decided he wanted to build them back.  But he knew he couldn't do it alone. So he co-founded I.CARE. and recruited other divers to help rebuild reefs in Florida one coral at a time. Meet Mike Goldberg, one of our CNN heroes.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIKE GOLDBERG, CO-FOUNDED I.CARE:  I love being underwater. The minute you go diving, the fish are right in your face. The interaction with that marine life is unlike anything I'd ever experienced. You're close up in person with all the animals, all the fish, the lobster, the crustaceans.  The Keys, in general, the ocean, the coral reef, the marine life used to be the best anywhere. The thriving coral reef is incredibly biodiverse. Multiple species coral, multiple species of fish, invertebrates, all living happily together. It's kind of buzzing when you get down there. There's so much activity.  I can tell you what a dying and struggling reef looks like easily because it's what I see most of the time now. Due to the water quality issues, rising temperature, acidification attracts algae. And then in 2014, there was something we called stony coral tissue loss disease as incredibly virulent. Once you lose the coral, there's nothing there. It's a literal underwater desert.  Good morning. You ready for the afternoon?  DR. KYLIE SMITH, CO-FOUNDED I.CARE:  Yeah. You got 14.  GOLDBERG:  Cool. Let me go get the tanks off the whip and we'll get them out to the boat.  When I got out of university, I started working in the financial services industry. I was chasing money the whole time. It just wasn't true to my core. So in 2004 we moved to Islamorada here in the Florida Keys and opened up a dive shop. You we've lost so much coral since I moved here 20 years ago. It truly is a pretty devastating number. What I saw here was so sad that I just wasn't sure how to solve the problem. I'm just one guy who's watched all of this loss. But then he said, you know what? I'm going to do something. I'm going to try something. It's not in me to walk away. It wasn't in me to just leave it to someone else to do.  Our organization, I.CARE, focuses on the rebuilding of the coral reefs here in the Florida Keys.  SMITH:  You can see over on the side here. All that's new growth, they like to grow.  GOLDBERG:  Dr. Smith, my co-founder, is a brilliant scientist. Without her, none of this happens.  (On camera):  It's amazing how fast this coral is growing.  (Voice-over):  Our goal is to make our reef self-sustaining and that it requires putting down resilient core. So what we do is we'll take multiples of that small piece of core, put them close together on a dead coral head, they fuse. And once they fuse, they're now large enough to spawn in five to seven years.  (On camera):  So we are speeding up that process. The coral reefs absolutely need human intervention to help. There is no way that this reef is going to bounce back all on its own.  (Voice-over):  I knew the only way that I could make it work is through the power of the recreational dive community. I'm not a scientist, but what I can do is tell the world of divers that are out there. Let's band together.  Any certified diver with recent dive skill is able to come out with us and plant coral.  SMITH:  If you guys didn't know, a coral is indeed an animal.  GOLDBERG:  A new diver to I.CARE will start the day with a coral workshop. They will learn why we're doing what we're doing. They'll learn the history of the reef, coral morphology, the science behind the corals.  They will have a hands-on workshop where they actually put coral in their hands that was once living. Learn how to attach it.  SMITH:  That looks great. Welcome to Mote's nursery.  GOLDBERG:  And they get a tour of the coral nursery here on shore.  SMITH:  Here is some fancy elkhorn. So critically endangered, right?  GOLDBERG:  What a beautiful thing. Oh, my God.  And they get to go out and plant coral. The great reward for me is to see the corals that we put down. That's the fruit of our labor. We're seeing it work. Anyone could have done this. And why isn't everyone taking up arms? It's simple. It's not complicated.  I'm happy that I get to be part of something that is maybe a solution. I wake up every day and say, look what I get to do.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Prom season is in the air, and some promposals are getting to be a pretty big deal. So today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is about a creative kid from Parkview High School in Orfordville, Wisconsin. Ryan Hazeltine wanted to ask his girlfriend to prom in a big way, so he used a big canvas using a tractor and a disc.  He spelled out prom? on his family's farm. And he didn't use a protractor to make those perfect letters or any other kind of measurements. He just eyeballed it. He used a drone to virtually fly his girlfriend Abby Anderson, way up for a bird's eye view. And it was an easy yes for Abby.  Now, if you're getting nervous about your promposal, don't worry. Just keep prom and carry on.  Special shout out to Atlanta, Georgia today GLOBE Academy. We see you. Thanks for subscribing and commenting on our CNN 10 YouTube Channel.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. It is a terrific Tuesday and a perfect day to show some love and give a shout out to our teachers. Go on and dap up your teach. Give them a handshake or a high five. Let them know you appreciate them.  Teachers, keep up lifting, informing, and inspiring hiring. We are grateful for all you do. I'm Coy Wire. You are awesome. This is CNN 10, the best ten minutes in news.  We start in Argentina, a vibrant country in South America, known for stunning natural landscapes, being home to tango dancing, gauchos, the World Cup soccer chance, and vibrant city life in Buenos Aires, the capital.  It's the world's 8th largest country, covering a huge portion of southern South America. But now Argentina's economy is on the edge of a crisis. Due to recession caused by a drought and growing inflation, the costs of many goods in Argentina have more than doubled what they were last year.  It's the first time that this has happened in three decades. Food and drink are among the items that were the most expensive. Citizens in Argentina are finding it very difficult to live on their salaries and to save money for their futures. They're taking to the streets to protest the government, which they say isn't doing enough to curb inflation and help its citizens.  But while the government is acknowledging problems, they're also pointing to recent job growth as a good sign. This all comes in the lead up to an election in October.  Up next, CNN's Rafael Romo will break down the economic situation in Argentina number by number. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Holding torches and banners, they march down some of the most iconic streets of downtown Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina. The march, organized by worker unions is the latest in a series of antigovernment protests.  Workers like Sylvia Sarabia (ph) say the government is not doing enough to alleviate a galloping yearly inflation that reached 104%, the second highest in Latin America after Venezuela's 501%.  Those who have a formal job get wages under the poverty line, she says. That's why these protests are so big.  Workers say the government of Argentina is taking money from the working class to pay the International Monetary Fund. President Alberto Fernandez admitted there are problems to be solved, but pointed to 30 months of job growth in the country.  Last month, Argentina reworked a $44 billion loan with the IMF, obtaining nearly 10 billion in fresh cash in exchange for measures to strengthen public finances and start reducing persistently high inflation.  President Fernandez is calling for unity, asking his fellow Argentines to please look towards the future. He says his finance minister is working on the issues and blamed some of the problems on the country's drought.  But for many people in Argentina, it's hard to have that kind of optimism when they don't even know if the next paycheck is going to allow them to make ends meet.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. What is the city with the most fountains in the world?  St. Petersburg, Russia, Rome, Italy, Florence, Italy or New York, New York?  Italy, no city on the planet has as many fountains as Rome, where you'll find more than 2000 of them.  Up next, a story about trying something new with something very, very old. Thousands of objects not making it into the Colosseum's new museum. They're now on full display. The Colosseum, the ancient Roman amphitheater in the center of the city best known for gladiator games, first opened in the year 80 A.D. Now its storage facilities full of artifacts are open to visitors at tiny museums all around the city. Let's go.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  Under the shadow of the Roman Colosseum, millions of people immerse themselves in ancient Roman history each year. Here in Rome, museum curators are spoiled for choice. What do you do with 500 Roman era coins?  With limited space in the site's new museum, the Colosseum is trying a new hands-on approach. Warehouses and storage facilities brimming with artifacts are currently open to visitors. These former shops and market stalls have been converted into temporary museum space to hold the leftover artifacts that didn't quite fit into a new museum that opened in 2021.  Until the end of July eight visitors at a time can reserve a special tour, guided by an archaeologist, who will let them hold these important historical finds. Many of which have not been on display in 30 years.  In this way, the people have direct contact with the ancient culture and materials archaeologist Roberta Alteri says. After that, their fate is unknown. The popular pieces will upgrade to the Museum, and the rest will go back to collecting dust in the warehouse.  Alfonsina Russo, the Director of the Colosseum Archaeological Park, says she hopes the project gives people a better understanding of daily life in ancient Romero.  ALFONSINA RUSSO, DIRECTOR OF COLOSSEUM ARCHEOLOGICAL PARK (through translator):  These artifacts tell the story of daily life, how they carried out activities, and above all, to bring these objects that would otherwise have remained hidden in our warehouses.  LATZA NADEAU:  She also hopes other historical sites open up their warehouses to let people see all history has to offer and to bring the past into focus. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Rome.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, engineer and entrepreneur Dhruv Boruah is developing a submarine that can filter microplastics out of the ocean. The goal replace sea vessels that emit carbon with a fleet of plastic filtering submarines that don't have emissions and are better for the environment. It's part of our Call to Earth series. Let's join Dhruv for his first sea trial in Miami.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Dhruv Boruah is on a mission to rid plastic from the ocean. It's a problem the engineer first became aware of during a yachting race across the Atlantic. Since then, Dhruv has dedicated himself to raising awareness of the issue by cycling down waterways in the world's largest cities.  DHRUV BORUAH, FOUNDER & CEO, OCEANWAYS:  Do you like the bike?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Now he is starting to think about the bigger picture.  BORUAH:  So we're collecting rubbish as well, so you can see loads of them on the underwater. Yeah.  (On camera):  I had reached around 300 million people worldwide. But a question here I ask myself every day where is the tangible impact? Where is the scale we are talking about? Because riding on a bicycle is so much you can do. So this project is all about restoring the ocean with microplastic collection, taking action around ocean acidification and everything else. But we start with microplastics and other data sensors.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Putting his engineering background to work, Dhruv started Oceanways, a company set on building a fleet of zero emission submarines that can carry cargo, replacing other carbon emitting vessels, while also filtering my microplastics from the water. Here in Biscayne Bay in Miami, Dhruv and his team are taking the new prototype out for its first sea trial.  BORUAH:  The water comes into the pipe, goes here. This is a filtration system. It comes out here, and we will collect everything here.  Then here we have got some sensors to collect ocean data. Behavior of the vehicle in the water today that we have collected a lot of data. Hopefully you can fit them into the simulator to learn what's going on here. Disconnected.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ultimately, the ambition is to use fuel cells that draw hydrogen from the ocean to power the submarines to travel autonomously.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's story, getting a 10 out of 10, please bear with me on a beautiful day in Asheville, North Carolina, a barefooted man was chilling in his chair on his back porch until bear. David Oppenheimer could barely contain his emotions freezing like frozen. Just him and a black bear locked in a stare.  Thankfully, the bear seemed to be just as scared as David. I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but this could have turned out really badly. Instead, it gives us a pretty hilarious moment.  All right, time for our shout out of the day. Klamath Falls, Oregon, Ponderosa Middle School. We see you. Thanks. For all the love.  Before I go, can y'all please help me out with something? I'm trying to be better about posting on social media. But there are so many of these special abbreviations to keep up with, like L-O-L. I know that means laugh out loud. But I keep seeing people use the letters IDK, and every time I ask someone what it means, they say, I don't know. So please hit me up @Coywire on Insta, Snapchat and TikTok. And let me know.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Welcome to CNN 10. Wonderful Wednesday to you. I'm so grateful to be right back with you for another great day of CNN 10. We have a fantastic show for you. All the news you need to know in 10 minutes. It's also your word Wednesday. Follow me @coywire on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok and put your unique vocabulary word in the comments section of my most recent post. And we're going to choose one winner to work into tomorrow's show. Let's go. We're going to start with the latest news on politics. Yesterday, U.S. President Joe Biden formally announced that he's running for reelection in 2024. The announcement came on the four-year anniversary of when he declared his current run for the White House in 2019. While seeking reelection is expected for most first term presidents, that hasn't always been the case for President Biden, and both Republicans and Democrats have expressed concern over Biden's age. He would be 86 years old by the end of his second term should he be reelected. That would make him the oldest president to ever complete a term by more than a decade. In the months ahead, President Biden will be looking to promote his record from his first term, seek to highlight the strong results Democrats had in the midterm elections, and showcase his more than 50 years of experience serving in politics. And while President Biden should face a smooth path to winning the Democratic nomination with no major rivals, the path to president will be a fierce battle. We'll hear now from CNN's Chief White House Correspondent Phil Mattingly with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  There's no question, over the course of the last 10 days, his closest advisers and outside allies have been laying the groundwork and accelerating efforts for a reelection announcement to come on Tuesday morning. That announcement would come four years to the day after the anniversary of his first presidential announcement in 2020. JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT:  We are in the battle for the soul of this nation. MATTINGLY:  Now during that campaign, he took on and defeated incoming president Donald Trump. Donald Trump, who is now the frontrunner for the Republican nomination once again. And therein lies some significant challenges for both. But in particular, President Biden, who is 80 years old and would be 86 at the time of his second term, coming to an end. (On camera):  According to an NBC poll, only 26% of American actually want to see Biden run again. If you look deep into the cross tabs of these polls, Democrats by a majority don't want Biden to run again. And those are some of the headwinds that the President will face. Their headwinds, however, his team is confident he can overcome. Overcome in part due to the sweeping legislative agenda he was able to get past Congress in his first two years, an agenda he will spend much of the next year selling and able to overcome because of who he will be facing. Whether it's Trump or some other Republican where advisors are very clear, they believe they will have a crystal-clear contrast message that will resonate with the American people. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. In what U.S. state would you find the tallest living tree on earth? California, Texas, Maine or South Carolina? At more than 380 feet tall or one and a quarter football field, a tree named Hyperion is located in California's Redwood National Forest. But its exact location? Well, that's a secret. Close to visitors to protect the 800-year-old giant. Some redwoods, the tallest trees on earth, have lived for thousands of years. They breathe in the moist, humid air along the California coast, and they can actually help keep the air clean. A man from Michigan believes that cloning these enormous trees is key to fighting climate change. David Milarch co-founded the Archangel Ancient tree Archive, and he's on a tremendous mission to save the earth with big trees. And some tiny helpers. CNN's Chief Climate Correspondent, Bill Weir, has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT:  Since they are an all too rare tourist attraction today, it could be hard to believe that giant redwoods used to line hundreds of miles of northern California coast, living for more than 2000 years as the tallest organisms on earth. Now, David Milarch and his Archangel Ancient Tree Archive is trying to plant a new generation of giants. He takes clippings from the tops of the oldest and largest, some 400 feet tall, back to his lab in Copemish, Michigan. There, specialists use a technique called micropropagation to grow them into saplings. And he says that from a single sample, a team of scientists can grow an unlimited number of clones. The problem, how to get them all in the ground. It would probably take an army. That is where these little soldiers come in. They are tree-schoolers at the Cow Hollow School in San Francisco. You heard right, not pre, but tree-  schoolers who attend outdoor classes to learn about ecology and sustainability at an early age by getting their little hands dirty. JEAN FRASER, CEO, PRESIDIO TRUST:  Today is particularly important because we're planting some very special trees, which is why we have some special helpers with us today. WEIR:  Keeping their focus is sometimes tough. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How do you plan sequoias. FRASER:  Sequoias, you plant them the same way, you got to make a hole in the ground, you're going to learn how to do that and do it with us. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I know how to make a hole. FRASER:  Good, all right. We need the holes in the ground. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I know what a hole is. WEIR:  But when it's finally time to get down to it, these budding foresters couldn't wait to dig in. On this day, about a dozen redwood trees made it into the soil. And for Milarch, these tree plantings are just a start. He hopes someday to replant millions of redwoods all over the world, using our littlest citizens to help sow the seeds for the biggest forms of life and a healthier planet. As the old proverb goes, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now. The meaning may not dawn on these tree schoolers quite yet, but they are proof that you're never too young or too old to have an impact. And even the tiniest of hands can make a huge difference. (END VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And for today's story, getting a 10 out of 10. It's about the age-old question that's plagued scientists and cat lovers throughout time. Why do cats love boxes? As soon as there's an empty box anywhere in a house, a cat's going to jump in that thing quicker than a hiccup. Other animals don't do that. I consider myself a cat person, so I'm really looking forward to this report. You've probably seen a video like this one, where the millions like it. The Internet is overrun by cats in boxes. But why so few videos of dogs in boxes? Well, we sat down with possibly one of the most qualified cat experts on the planet. INGRID JOHNSON, IAABC CERTIFIED CAT BEHAVIOR CONSULTANT:  That stuff on you can't have schmutz on you. It's CNN. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  To find out why cats like boxes and dogs don't. JOHNSON:  I think one of the things that we have to remember is that cats are a species that are both predator and prey. So for cats, cardboard boxes can be a spot of safety and security. Nice place to hide and cozy up and take a nap. Also, a great ambush point. Cats are ambush predators and would much rather just sit under a shrub and slowly wait for their prey to just meander by so that they can successfully catch it. A cardboard box inside can serve a similar purpose and provide a place for them to pounce. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Having a safe space for a cat, like a cardboard box is essential for their well-being. It's been proven that cats are far less stressed and also less likely to break with illness in a shelter setting if they're provided with a box, because they need a place to feel safe and to be able to hide. One of the reasons cats like cardboard boxes so much is because cardboard is insulating and helps cats not need to expel any additional energy to maintain their body temperature. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And sometimes there's just a simpler reason cats like boxes. JOHNSON:  They love to squeeze themselves into a tiny box. And why? It's cozy. It's fun. They like it. The big cats like boxes, too. Probably not much of a box left when they're done with it. A lot of people do not meet their cat's environmental needs. They need nooks and crannies. They need places to hide. You know, every time Amazon delivers, why not give something to your cat for enrichment? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Now, back to the question, how come our dogs just don't love boxes as much as cats do? JOHNSON:  They don't have the same hunting strategies. They don't have the same need for preservation in a place to hide. Some dogs dig them, but mostly I think they enjoy tearing them up. It's just not a dog thing. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  So, cats hide in boxes so they can pounce on us? Sneaky cats. Huge difference between cats and dogs, right? That report, it reminds me of one of my favorite quotes about cats and dogs. Dogs will give you unconditional love until the day they die. Cats will make you pay for every mistake you've ever made since the day you were born. All righty, meow. Time for my favorite part of the day. I want to give a special shout out to Decatur Middle School in Indianapolis, Indiana. Rise up. Remember, submit your unique vocabulary word for your word. Wednesday. Can't wait to work the winner into tomorrow's show. I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10. END230427

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello lovely people. Welcome to Thursday or as we like to say Happy Friday Eve. I'm here in Kansas City, Missouri home to some bang in barbecue and the Super Bowl Champion Kansas City Chiefs. The NFL draft is here this weekend and starting tonight in the first round, the best college players will see their hard work, dedication and sacrifice pay off when their names are called welcoming them to the NFL.  Now, let's get to your news. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start with the latest between the United States and South Korea. U.S. President Joe Biden and South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol, they met yesterday at the White House to celebrate their alliances and to make new agreements aimed at deterring aggression from North Korea. With concerns about North Korea growing, the two nations unveiled the Washington declaration, a set of new steps to boost U.S. and South Korean cooperation on military training, strategy and assets. This includes a commitment from the United States to deploy a nuclear armed submarine in South Korea for the first time since the early 1980s. This collaboration comes a year after the North Koreans fired a record number of nuclear missile tests. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT:  When it comes right down to it, it's about what you believe, what you stand for, what kind of future you want for your children and grandchildren. And right now, I believe the world is in an inflection point. The choices we make today, I believe are going to determine the direction of our world and the future our kids for decades to come. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  The other purpose for the meeting this week is to celebrate 70 years of alliances between the U.S. and South Korea. And the visit signals the importance of U.S. relations with other allies in the Indo-Pacific region.  Next week, President Biden will host the President of the Philippines Ferdinand Marcos Jr. And in the coming weeks he's expected to travel to that region himself. We'll keep you updated on those events right here on CNN 10.  Ten second trivia. In terms of scientific classification, the giant panda is part of which family? Ursidae, Phocidae, Canidae or Felidae? One of the most recognizable animals in the world giant pandas belong to the Ursidae family, which is the bear family.  Did you know that pandas are often used as diplomatic gifts in China. Beijing sent a panda named Ya Ya to a Tennessee zoo two decades ago as a sign of cooperation. What is meant to be a bridge of diplomacy between the two nations has become a point of tension though. CNN International Correspondent Selina Wang is on the ground in China with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Once a symbol of Beijing's goodwill now the center of angry debate in China. This panda in Memphis, Tennessee has become the latest victim in worsening U.S.-China tensions. Ya Ya arrived in America with her playmate Le Le two decades ago as an emblem of growing bilateral friendship.  But recent videos showing the ones fluffy panda now looking skinny with scraggly fur has sparked outrage in China. Many Chinese people in some animal advocates accusing the zoo of mistreatment.  Videos on Chinese social media claiming the pandas are being abused quickly went viral against the backdrop of growing anti-American sentiment. The rumors often fanned by state propaganda.  And meanwhile, Chinese social media users are praising these viral videos of this panda in Russia Ruyi claiming videos of the active and playful panda prove Russia is taking excellent care of the Chinese bear. State TV saying the pandas are helping the Russia-China relationship.  Chinese and American scientists launched a joint investigation concluding that Ya Ya has a genetic fur and skin condition that does not impact her quality of life. And has received excellent care. But that message is not getting through.  Outside the panda exhibit at the Beijing Zoo. I asked people if they've heard of Ya Ya the panda? This man says, yes, she's abused in America. An 11-year-old boy tells me I heard the U.S. is treating the panda poorly. This man says isn't Russia taking good care of pandas. Pandas are happy over there, not like in the U.S. And this man with his granddaughter tells me pandas in Russia are very happy, why? Russians and Chinese are friends. At least Russia is not sanctioning China.  (On camera): Ya Ya will soon settle in this Beijing Zoo. Now China has long used its pandas as a diplomatic tool. Currently, its pandas on loan to about 20 countries. The United States has not received one since Ya Ya and Le Le 20 years ago. Now these pandas are normally loaned on these 10-year leases, and they cost a million dollars annually.  (Voice-over): The Memphis Zoo had already planned to send Ya Ya and Le Le back to Beijing this spring because their lease is expiring, but Le Le died of heart disease two months ago, at the age of 24. The average lifespan for pandas is usually under 30 years. Yet that didn't stop rampant speculation and led to an explosion of accusations about Ya Ya treatment too, accelerating calls to bring Ya Ya back to China.  The message even featured on billboards from New York City to major cities across China. In 1972, during U.S. President Richard Nixon's historic trip to China, his wife visited pandas in Beijing. PAT NIXON, U.S. FORMER FIRST LADY, RICHARD NIXON'S WIFE:  On behalf of the people of the United States, I am pleased to be here and accept the precious gift. WANG:  Months later, China sent a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington D.C. Now, decades later, this pandas returned from the U.S. to China symbolic, not a growing friendship, but growing animosity between two global superpowers. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, have you ever heard the saying birds of a feather video chat together? I certainly hadn't. But today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is about some parents causing quite a kerfuffle by taking video chatting to the next level. Apparently they were taught not how to ask for a cracker but how to ask for a device to talk with their parent friends. Researchers studied parent behavior during these conversations and came up with some unexpected conclusions. Our very own Jeanne Moos has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Instead of the usual Polly wants a cracker parrot owners are asking if Polly wants a video chat.  REBECCA KLEINBERGER, STUDY CO-AUTHOR, NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY:  Want to say hi? Do you want to talk to her? You do? OK.  MOOS:  It's enough to make a lonely parrot Bob its head with excitement. And a paper titled, "Birds of a Feather Video-Flock Together," researchers described teaching 18 pet parrots to ring a bell. When they rang the bell they were presented with a tablet.  KLEINBERGER:  Which friend would you like to call? MOOS:  And given a choice of parrots for a video chat?  KLEINBERGER:  You want to call Rosie?  MOOS:  Over a three-month period. KLEINBERGER:  Oh Sammy, OK.  MOOS:  The parrots made 147 requests for video calls. KLEINBERGER:  Good job, that's Georgie. Some birds got called a lot with our VIP birds. Some called -- some birds got called less. MOOS:  The ones who got called the most were the ones who also made the most calls. The researchers could tell the birds were truly engaged because they premed together. Try did touch one another imitated each other and even sort of sang.  OK, so maybe there were no lovestruck movie moments.  KLEINBERGER:  Whoa, she's beautiful.  MOOS:  But if you are researching parrots, can there be a greater thrill than this? KLEINBERGER:  Sometimes a bird would actually really call us so sometimes I was in a meeting or giving a class or at home and I would get a phone call from a bird. MOOS:  Imagine seeing on your caller ID Sammy, the parrot. Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, everyone. We had some awesome Your Word Wednesday submissions yesterday. Thanks to today's winner Catherine from Park Middle in West Virginia for kerfuffle. Did you hear it in the show? It's a noun meaning a commotion or fuss, especially one caused by conflicting views.

BRYCE YOUNG:  I'm Bryce Young and this is CNN 10. COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up lovely people, it's the best day of the week, Friday or as you could say, Fridyey. I'm still here in Kansas City covering the NFL Draft. And can I just say that you all are awesome. I got to meet some students and teachers like Mr. Johnson, a big time Steelers fan.  And thanks for the love from Ms. Wilson from SM South High, Mr. Cordell from Leawood Middle, and the Horizon Academy, you rock.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news. Let's go. In a narrow final vote the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday that would raise the nation's debt ceiling. The debt ceiling is the total amount of money the government is authorized to borrow. The package raises the nation's debt limit by an additional $1.5 trillion up from the more than 31 trillion where it currently stands.  But the plan raises the ceiling in return for spending cuts that are effectively conditions that would take money away from President Joe Biden's agenda. And while this measure was passed from the Republican led House, it is seen as dead-on arrival in the Democratic led Senate.  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Republicans, well, they're looking to negotiate with Democrats and President Biden. But President Biden reiterated that he would not meet with McCarthy on extending the debt limit saying it's, "not negotiable."  The White House says that Republicans are holding the economy hostage and slashing programs that hurt the American people. For his part, though, Speaker McCarthy has said the President is putting the economy in jeopardy and that the House has done its job by passing a bill to avoid default.  So why does this all matter? Well, analysts believe that not raising the debt ceiling could be catastrophic where the economy can hit a freeze, millions of jobs would be lost and interest rates and loans would spike. In recent years, the debt ceiling debate has been seen as a political tug of war where the American people, well, they're the ones always on the losing end.  Our Christine Romans has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Every day the U.S. draws closer to the so-called ex-state when it runs out of money to pay all the bills. The debt ceiling of $31.4 trillion was hit January 19, unable to borrow more money. The Treasury Department is using so-called extraordinary measures, moving money around, delaying some investments to make sure everything is paid. And sometime soon as quickly as early June, the accounting tricks run out and the U.S. risks defaulting on its obligations.  Now, assuming interest payments get top priority every family would face cuts. Social Security payments could be delayed, veterans could receive an IOU instead of benefits. Federal employees could be furloughed, and it would be catastrophic for financial markets where the credit worthiness of the United States is the cornerstone of the global financial system.  A default on the debt would trigger market crashes that would crush business and consumer confidence that could further shock the financial system and throw the economy into a recession. Treasuries could tank interest rates spike, the dollar sync and global economies reel. That is the reality Congress is sleepwalking toward unless it raises the debt ceiling.  Now Congress has raised the limit 78 times since 1960, 49 times under Republican presidents, 29 times under Democrats. But in recent years, it has become a political football in a game where the American people are the losing team. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  10 Second trivia. Which of these countries has not performed a controlled landing on the moon? United States, the former Soviet Union, China or Japan? Raise your hand if you said Japan, no moon landing for them. But a Japanese commercial company attempted a landing this week. Hakuto-R, a lunar lander from Japan would touchdown on the moon this week, at least that was the plan. Ispace, which is a Japanese firm launched it on a SpaceX rocket back in December from Cape Canaveral Florida then entered orbit around the moon taking three months for it to get there. The plan was to land Tuesday afternoon. But flight controllers lost communication with the craft leading officials to assume that it was lost or even crashed. Hakuto-R was supposed to release a data collecting rover even a robot, the size of a tennis ball but before it did, the mission was over. This could have been historic landing this craft upon the moon being the first by a private company perhaps another we'll try again soon.  Next up, a rarely talked about aspect of the Russian invasion on Ukraine. It has taken a huge and sad toll for so many people in the region. But what about the animals that need to be saved as well? Well, if you're not, there's actually a pair of veterinarians bunkered underground and aiding all sorts of wildlife from snakes to owls to parrots, guinea pigs, even monkeys.  During the rescue efforts, they've even had to dodge a few Russian bullets. Just one week after the invasion they cared for about 400 rescued animals in their clinic. Meet Leonid and Valentina Stoyanov, two of our very own CNN Heroes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VALENTINA STOYANOV:  We are Leonid and Valentina Stoyanov, exotic and wildlife veterinarians. We're here right now in Ukraine, in Odesa. LEONID STOYANOV:  All our family, mother, father have to leave Ukraine but we decided for us that we stay here and help animals. V. STOYANOV:  This is our hospital.  L. STOYANOV:  Come on, very cold. V. STOYANOV:  We are almost underground. This safe place for us and for anyone. We usually have unusual animals. For example, turtles, chameleons, different parrots, guinea pigs, and monkeys. When invasions come, we helps dogs and cats. A lot of people think that all this situation in Ukraine will be three, four days. So a lot of people just close animals in apartments in houses and think that everything will be fine. After one, two weeks, it is become very big problem. Neighbors start here how a lot of different animals around them screaming. Each rescue, it's so tough and at the same time very touching because each animals for us it's like a members of our family. L. STOYANOV:  We buy tons of dog food, cat food, go to shelters. We feed maybe 600 dogs. We go to frontline and vaccinated and feed dog, cats. And Russian army, a lot of times shooting our car, and they bombed it. And we have a lot of holes in our car.  We have a lot of work, a lot of animals, a lot of people dying, a lot of our friends dying. Our Vet Crew family, it's our -- V. STOYANOV:  Social media, yeah. L. STOYANOV:  Social media, it help us. V. STOYANOV:  Of course they send a lot of donations to our foundation, but most important thing for us become kind messengers. Because a lot of people, you know, just start write us, "Guys, hold on. You are heroes." It's huge, huge support and we are very, very, very grateful for all this. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is on and popping. A baby moose on the loose in Alaska popped into a movie theater and the story gets even butter. The movie theater manager says the moose probably smelled popcorn and for about five minutes was rummaging all around eaten any kernel of corn it could get. Employees even eventually shouting for the hungry moose to leave. For fella just wanted to catch a flick and a little happy meal too.  Well that's about all we have time for, for now. The weekend is upon us and it's not just the end of the week. It's the end of the month too. Can you believe? It'll already be May on Monday. Time flies so maximize these moments lovely people.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Happy Monday and Happy May to you. I'm so grateful to be back coming to you from CNN Center reporting from the NFL Draft last week, really was special, though, in large part because I got to meet so many of you, Liberty High School, you rock. What's up Wilbert. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start with a story we brought you last week, an update on Ya Ya the panda sent to a Memphis Zoo two decades ago from China. The moment encapsulated a high point in U.S.-China relations. Remember pandas are used as diplomatic gifts in China. But pandemonium surface, when many people in China and some animal advocates accused the zoo of mistreatment after a video came out showing the ones furry, cuddly panda looking skinny was scraggly fur. However American and Chinese scientists concluded after a joint investigation that Ya Ya has a genetic fur and skin condition and that pandas at this zoo "received excellent care." But reputational damage had already been done. Anti-American panda propaganda flooded feeds on Chinese social media, causing outrage. The plan all along was for Ya Ya to stay at the Memphis Zoo for 20 years and return this spring and Ya Ya is now back in China. It was a highly anticipated homecoming. Our Will Ripley has more about this panda that was once a sign of friendship, but has now become a symbol of growing tension between the U.S. and China. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  In China, a hero's welcome for Ya Ya the panda. At the end of a 16-hour flight from Memphis to Shanghai. Crowds gathered outside the airport trying to catch just a glimpse of Ya Ya's crate. Her first moments back on Chinese soil. She'll spend the next month in quarantine at the Shanghai zoo, where immediate feeding frenzy is in full swing. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And many Chinese have been watching closely and looking forward to Ya Ya's return. RIPLEY:  This geriatric giant panda is a household name in China for all the wrong reasons. When Ya Ya's panda playmate died of heart disease in February, pictures of Ya Ya with scraggly fur and sagging skin sparked online pandemonium. A Chinese social media frenzy fueled by false claims. Rampant rumors denied by the zoo of panda abuse and neglect in the U.S. Outrage amplified by anti-American sentiment.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ya Ya, come back home. RIPLEY:  Bring Ya Ya home became a rallying cry for millions of Chinese. The panda's picture plastered on billboards from Beijing to the Big Apple. It's true, Ya Ya was young and fluffy when she arrived at the Memphis Zoo 20 years ago. On a long-term multimillion dollar lease from China. U.S. and Chinese scientists say she has a genetic condition affecting her skin and fur, a condition that worsens with old age. No impact on her quality of life just her looks. They even issued a joint statement saying the fact is, Ya Ya had excellent care. But facts don't always matter in a world full of fake news.  Anti-American panda propaganda is filling the feeds of Chinese social media users. No mention of the healthy pandas at two other American zoos, but plenty of pictures of an active and playful panda in Russia, a panda Chinese state media praises for improving bilateral ties.  Ya Ya's saga will end where it began. The Beijing zoo where she'll live out her final years. She just might be the world's most politicized Panda, a beloved bear that brought the U.S. and China closer now being used to divide.  (On camera):  China has been using pandas as a political tool for decades. They are national treasures and China is very selective about which countries get these million dollar a year panda loans, the U.S. had not one in two decades. Ya Ya was the last one. But they also heavily censored social media and allowed this online backlash to grow to the point that people were calling for all pandas to be pulled out of the U.S. and panda diplomacy to end altogether. And only on Wednesday did the Foreign Ministry of China say that in fact, the pandas at the Memphis Zoo were well taken care of and actually loved by the American people. Halfhearted attempt perhaps to dial back some of this controversy. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, you all learn studying some very important staple subjects in your schools every day, right, social studies, history, math, science, the arts on and on. But in today's world, there are some other important topics that might not always be easy to talk about. One school in the San Diego area is having their fifth graders tackle issues like racism, bullying, pollution, even gun violence through animations. Our Camila Bernal explains more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Good morning. Buenos dias. CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The day begins for these fifth graders with the usual subjects, math, science, reading, and even P.E. Those may appear easy in comparison to talking about gun violence, global warming, bullying, racism. CHRISTIAN LOPEZ, 5TH GRADE STUDENT:  I chose racism because for me racism is something really -- something that I see often and something that happens and I feel like all people should be treated the same way, not because they're different. Because inside, we're all the same. BERNAL:  Christian Lopez is just one of the more than 500 5th grade students tackling these issues at the National School District just outside of San Diego. The students choose a topic. AXEL VI, 5TH GRADE STUDENT:  Yeah, I did like world hunger. I feel bad, I really feel bad about because they don't have the life I have.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We can donate to help them get food and fresh water. BERNAL:  And then use animation --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you think guns should be allowed? Well, I don't. BERNAL:  -- to explain their thoughts.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Immigration is a problem for everyone. They separate individuals from another, that's a form of injustice. SHARMILA KRAFT, ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT EDUCATION SERVICES, NATIONAL SCHOOL DISTRICT:  If these are the issues, these are the components that these young people will face as they become adult, then I believe that it is our responsibility to support them in learning how to maneuver some of the nuances. BERNAL:  But maneuvering wasn't always easy. According to animator David Heredi, who created this five-week program. DAVID HEREDI, FOUNDER, HEROES OF COLOR:  It makes people uncomfortable when you put them in a situation to talk about something that is not their lived experience. And because of that, I think it's unfair to put a muzzle on a child who wants to express what they're feeling. BERNAL:  So instead you allow them to talk through their art.  LOPEZ:  Just because they're a different race doesn't mean that you have to be rude or to like not to be nice to them, because it's really hurtful for those people. BERNAL:  They found ways to help solve or highlight the issues. LOPEZ:  No matter what color we are, we all are humans. BERNAL: And then, they got to feel like celebrities as they share their animations with the world. HEREDI:  It allows us to actually stop and listen to what's going on in the world of a child and have them offer a potential solution to that problem. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  When you're kind to someone they're going to be kind to someone else or you, you should always be kind. BERNAL:  The students feel heard and say they will continue to explore these social justice issues. LOPEZ:  We could still keep working on and progress to make it better. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. In 1817, "The Aerial Walk" considered to be the world's first modern roller coaster opened in what city? Paris, France, Brooklyn, New York, London, England or Anaheim, California? "The Promenades-Aeriennes" or "The Aerial Walk" debuted in Paris. Passengers walked up a set of stairs, wrote a bench down at 40 miles per hour, Woo-hoo. Now the folks in Paris from the 19th Century would have said, ooh la la wae wae to the rollercoasters nowadays. They've evolved so much and there's so fast. Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is an amusement park that you could call the roller coaster capital of the world. Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California is home to a whopping 20 roller coasters more than any other theme park on the planet. Some coasters given chills and thrills are called Wonder Woman, flight of courage, Twisted Colossus. And how about the X2 with its 360-degree rotating seats and head-first, face down drops. That's enough to send you on an emotional roller coaster.  You know, the most difficult part of a roller coaster is the anticipation of climbing that first big incline. The rest is mostly downhill.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Come on in. Come on in. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news. Yesterday May 1, as you know, was May Day in many countries around the world, commemorating the historic struggles and gains made by workers in the labor movement, much like Labor Day here in the U.S. But in France yesterday, the holiday turned ugly in Paris as police battled in Workers Union organized protests, with people raging against President Emmanuel Macron's decision to raise the retirement age last month. The looming decision has been fought persistently and violently for several months. In January strikes in cities all across France disrupted train services, planes, schools and businesses across France, as more than 1 million people protested at once. But nothing has stopped French leaders from officially signing into law the very unpopular change to France's pension system. The country's Constitutional Council, which is similar to the Supreme Court here in the U.S. approved raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 last month. Some of France's most powerful unions say they're going to keep fighting. For his part French President Emmanuel Macron believes the current system relying on the working population to pay for a growing age group of retirees is no longer fit for purpose. And it is worth noting that this new higher pension age will still keep France well below the norm in Europe and in many other developed economies. These protests are nothing new to the French though. Our Melissa Bell reports to us from Paris about the long history of protests and strikes in France. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT: Whether it's over a million protesters on the streets against pension reform, or demonstrations against infrastructure planning, pesticide bans, or the rise in the cost of living, France is no stranger to protests, and strike action. In fact, the country consistently ranks amongst those most affected by industrial action in Europe. And for national rail workers alone, there hasn't been a single year without some kind of strike action since 1947. So why do the French protest and strike so much? The origins of the spirits of protests here in France go right back to the French Revolution. And we've had a reminder of that historical threads, the cacerolada (ph) protests with pots and pans, of which we've seen a resurgence that goes right back to medieval times. We saw it again in the 1830s in a revolution that led to the abdication of Charles X. There is also of course, the question of the famous "Droits acquis" these are rights that have been acquired hard won, and that the French don't want to give up. France does seem to protest more readily and often than many other countries. And that goes back to that social pact that was created after World War II. The French are very attached to it and will take to the streets to protect whatever part of it they feel is under assault. There is also a history of very strong trade unions in this country, and the historical facts that protests can have an effect on the politics of the time. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. Talking royalty now, at which of these British landmarks would you see the crowning of a king or queen? Buckingham Palace, Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, or St Paul's Cathedral? Westminster Abbey has been the coronation location for every single British monarch since the year 1066. It's a pretty big deal happening in Westminster Abbey this weekend as King Charles III will officially be crowned on Saturday. According to Buckingham Palace and expected 3000 guests will attend the coronation versus the 8000 who gathered for the late Queen Elizabeth crowning. King Charles became king following the death of his mother in September. Queen Elizabeth II reigned for 70 years, having become queen at the age of 25. King Charles is expected to sit upon his coronation chair, which has been used by monarchs for more than 700 years. But listen to this, his crown is estimated to be worth more than $4 million. And it's all blinged out with gold, rubies, sapphires, garnet and more. It weighs more than five pounds, making the phrase heavy as the head that wears the crown quite literal. Max Foster is in London with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT:  Not since 1953 that we had a glimpse of this sacred moment. The crowning of a monarch, Queen Elizabeth, then just 27 thrust to the throne after her father's untimely death. Her coronation was designed to introduce the young queen to the world and give a morale boost to post-war Britain. 70 years on, and amidst a cost-of- living crisis, King Charles' coronation will have many of the same traditions incorporated, albeit slightly toned down. Up to 2800 guests in Westminster Abbey, CNN understands, versus the 8000, who gathered for the late queens. ELIZABETH NORTON, ROYAL HISTORIAN: The King has actually ruffled some feathers by not inviting many members of the ancient nobility, including some of the Dukes, in fact. But instead, actually the King has invited members of the community, so charitable workers, for example. FOSTER: A sign perhaps that Charles wants to make the monarchy more accessible, though much of the pomp and ceremony will of course remain. The coronation is first and foremost a religious ceremony. It culminates in the King's anointing with holy oil, which has been consecrated in Jerusalem. NORTON:  It's seen as symbolizing the king's commitment to God because, of course, he's a very religious man himself. He's now the head of the church, and it's a sacred moment. FOSTER: His wife, Camilla, will also be anointed and crowned. Charles' sons, William and Harry, will be there. Although Harry's wife Meghan will remain at home in California with their two young children. It remains to be seen what role Harry will play in proceedings now that he's set back from his senior role duties. For many in Britain, the coronation is about more than just another public holiday. There'll be street parties up and down the U.K. and 1000s will come here to Buckingham Palace to witness the famous balcony moment to see for the first time the newly crowned king and queen. (Voice-over): Many more will line the streets for the coronation procession, just as they did for Queen Elizabeth seven decades ago. The King and Queen will travel in this gilded carriage accompanied by a huge military procession. Nighttime rehearsals spotted in the streets of London as the Capitol gears up for a moment in history. Max Foster, CNN London. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Did you know giant anteaters can get up to eight feet long. But listen to this, their tongue is two feet long and they can flick it in and out of their mouth 150 times per minute more than two times per second. But you can't do that. Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is about a sweet anteater named Eury in North Carolina and all she wants to do is catch some Z's. Jeanne Moos has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  What is this thing and why is this keeper having such a hard time waking him up? KELLY RAUCH, GREENSBORO SCIENCE CENTER, NORTH CAROLINA KEEPER:  Good morning. MOOS:  Rob his ears. RAUCH:  Want to wake up? MOOS:  Give him his favorite treat avocado still he puts his paw over his ear. Eury, the 22-year-old giant anteater just covers his head with his tail a built-in blanket. RAUCH:  This is an everyday thing for me is getting this boy out of bed is difficult. MOOS:  The Greensboro North Carolina Science Center captioned the video, "our sweet, forever teenager." RAUCH:  Come on Eury. Come on. MOOS:  It went massively viral who doesn't relate just five more minutes. What does he have to get up for? Is he late for something? Let him sleep. But Eury named after the vacuum cleaner brand your Eureka needs to get up and take his meds mixed in avocado. 22 is ancient for an anteater. In the wild they only live to about 14. (On camera): Are anteaters dangerous? I bet they could disembowel you with their claws. RAUCH: That is totally true. So, we actually don't go in with Eury when he's awake and walking around like this. MOOS:  Check out the claws on this itchy anteater in South America. No wonder keeper Kelly Rauch held Eury's leg. RAUCH: Don't give me the claw. MOOS:  In case he woke up on the wrong side of the bed. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  I feel bad for anteaters. They must be so lonely being that there's no such thing as an uncle eater. All right, that's about all we have time for, for now. But first hello to all of our friends in Federal Way Washington.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello lovely people, good day and good vibes to you from magnificent Miami. We're here ahead of the huge Formula One race this weekend. And that guy right there, well, that's the legend seven-time world champ Lewis Hamilton. He'll be one of the fastest drivers on the planet. Zoom in at top speeds of about 200 miles per hour. We hope you're often zooming today as well.  It's Wednesday, May 3, also #yourwordwednesday. Follow me @coywire on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok and put your unique vocabulary word in the comment section of my most recent posts. And we're going to choose one, good one to work in tomorrow's show.  Let's go. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start in Spain today where they are seeing a major drought. The Spanish National Weather Service says the country has been in a long-term drought since the end of last year.  In March, the country only received 36% of its average monthly rainfall, which made it the second driest March this century. But it didn't stop there, that trend continued into last month and we may see it now end up being the driest on record. These conditions have been caused by soaring temperatures that make it feel like it's mid-summer instead of springtime.  The lack of water, well, it's having a catastrophic impact on farms across the region. According to the coordinator of farmers and ranchers organizations, the drought has affected about 60% of Spain's countryside, and it's destroyed crops across more than 8 million acres. That's an area bigger than the entire State of Maryland.  Also, Spaniards have been asked to conserve water by taking quick showers, being mindful when washing dishes and not filling their swimming pools. Our Senior International Correspondent Fred Pleitgen has more on the very dry conditions in Spain. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: From afar, even a natural disaster can look majestic. But up close, the full impact of the global climate emergency is clear to see. This is the Sau Reservoir near Barcelona, normally one of the largest bodies of freshwater in this part of Spain, but months of drought and the water levels are so low and the entire medieval village usually underwater has come to light. (On camera): The folks here say normally you'd barely be able to see even the tip of the medieval church because it would be almost fully submerged. But now as you can see the church is very much on land and the authorities here fear things will get much worse once the summer's heat really sets in. (Voice-over): The Sau Reservoir is already at less than 10% capacity. And that's causing hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland to dry up. All of this wheat is probably lost. Farmers, Santi Caudevilla shows me why. The grain should be milky, he said. We're in a critical moment. If it doesn't rain, this will end up empty. We should be seeing the grain come up to here but it's only like this. If it doesn't rain in the coming week the crop will be zero. But there is no rain in sight and temperatures in Spain have skyrocketed. Scientists at the Institute of Agri-Food Research and Technology are trying to find ways to make very little water go a longer way. Chief scientist Joan Girona says efficiency to be maximized. JOAN GIRONA GOMIS, RESEARCHER, IRTA:  It's our goal, taking the most of our drop of water.  PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Just like the crops, the people in this area are also in survival mode. Dozens of towns are without water and need to get it trucked in. The village Castellcir hasn't had any for about a year and residents say they can't even remember the last time it rained. I don't recall, Juan, tells me. It's been a long time a year or more without proper rain, nothing. Back at the Sau Reservoir, authorities are actually draining most of the remaining water to prevent this precious and ever scarcer resource from getting contaminated by the sludge at the bottom of this once mighty lake. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, summer is just around the corner. And if you and your family are thinking about heading to any of the South Florida or Caribbean beaches, you might need to know that you could encounter some seaweed, and by some I mean a whole lot of it. That's because a record-breaking amount of seaweed known as Sargassum, which can smell like rotten eggs or sulfur when it washes up on shore is starting to pile up on popular beaches threatening tourism in certain areas.  Check out this NASA image which shows just how enormous this massive blob of floating seaweed is, 13 million tons of it just drifting ominously throughout the Caribbean stretching all the way to the West Coast of Africa. CNN's Leyla Santiago reports from a beach in Key West, Florida and tells us how this seaweed phenomenon is just the tip of the iceberg with the peak expected to come later this summer.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LEYLA SANTIAGO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is Sargassum mixed in with a few other things and this is what is inundating Florida's Coast specifically they're expecting the East Coast. And remember last month we talked about this but now we're actually starting to see it come in and those record numbers that scientists predicted. So much so that take a look over here, the beach rakers here on this beach and Key West have already a wide and have already done one run through on what's hitting the Florida coast right now. Let's go for a walk so I can kind of show you how all of this stuff just piles up and again gets pretty smelly, because it decays out here. And as we mentioned, this is what one scientist told me it's just the tip of the iceberg, more expected. Because when this is out there, it is not only right now a 5000-mile-long body of seaweed, it is still growing while it's out there, so it is increasing in the amount that will be headed this way. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. What country has the southernmost capital in the world? Argentina, Australia, New Zealand or South Africa? When it comes to capital cities, Wellington New Zealand is as low as you can go sitting at 41 degrees south. Now when you think of New Zealand, you might think of Kiwis which is the country's iconic national bird but the population of these flightless birds has plummeted. Conservationists say that most people have never seen a kiwi in the wild and estimate that there are only about 70,000 of them left in the country. But as our Michael Holmes tells us there are now efforts to keep this species alive and thriving in New Zealand. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The fight to save the Kiwi, the iconic flightless bird is taking off in New Zealand. PAUL WARD, CAPITAL KIWI PROJECT TEAM LEADER:  Ever since people came here we've had a special connection with the animal known as the kiwi, Central Tamari Mirth (ph) sports teams, our rugby league team, our defense force, you know, even when we go overseas, we're known as kiwis. So it's our duty really to look after the animal that's gifted us its name. HOLMES:  There are about 90 initiatives to save the Kiwis in New Zealand, many of them focusing on removing threats, which have reduced the population by educating dog owners and killing predator species like stoats.  WARD:  Kiwi are surprisingly tough and resilient. They got these big fighting claws so now Kiwi can fight off a whole heap of pests from possums and stoats that really the only issue for adult kiwi is roaming dogs. Where they get hammered as stoats eating the checks before they get up to that fighting weight.  HOLMES:  A group of Kiwis raised in a breeding program was released near Wellington last November. Experts say that could be the first-time wild Kiwis lived in the area in about a century. And so far, they seem to be thriving.  WARD:  We did the first health check a couple of months later. And we were expecting them to kind of, you know, hold weight or lose a bit of weight. But the really pleasing result was that half of those birds had put on weight including one bit put on a whopping 400 grams. So it's like this here plenty of food on the ladder out on these hills.  HOLMES:  That's hopefully room to grow for New Zealand's national treasure and the national effort to save it. Michael Holmes, CNN.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello sunshine. Welcome to Thursday or as we like to say, Happy Friday Eve. We're here in beautiful Miami ahead of the big Formula One race this weekend, where drivers like the legend Lewis Hamilton will be going, flying down the track more on him in a few. Let's get this show on the road and do it we do. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news. Let's start today with something that's making big headlines out of Hollywood in the entertainment industry, the writer strike. More than 11,000 members of the Writers Guild of America went on strike for the first time in more than 15 years. It's a move bringing the production of many television shows to a standing halt. And it could even possibly delay the start of new seasons of other shows later this year. Writers say they are not being paid by the studios fairly in the streaming era. Union leadership says, "studios responses to our proposals have been wholly insufficient, given the existential crisis writers are facing." And that they are, "closing the door on their labor force and opening the door to writing as an entirely freelance profession." Now the alliance of Motion Picture and television producers is the trade association that bargains on behalf of the studios, television networks and streaming platforms. They said in a statement that its offer included, "generous increases in compensation for writers." But was not willing to meet some of the union's demands such as requiring companies to staff television shows with a certain number of writers for a specific period of time, whether needed or not. Many shows on cable and broadcast networks have already filmed their final episodes for the current season. But late-night shows will be the first to be impacted with this strike as many of those shows have already announced they'll be going dark this week. Our Stephanie Elam has more for us from the picket lines. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: These members of the Writers Guild of America are out here in front of Netflix in Hollywood, to voice their displeasure with contract negotiations and saying that they're on strike because they need to make a living wage. A lot of these people live here in Los Angeles or in New York, where those are two of the most expensive cities in their country. And they're saying they need to make a living wage and at issue, they're also saying that they should make more money for the shows that they do for the streamers. They're saying that the business model hasn't adapted and they're not getting their fair share. Also, they're saying they want to make sure that the writer rooms are protected. And the number of writers who are on the show have viable work. They're saying that the studios are really pushing for a gig economy. And they're saying they can't support their families that way. In fact, take a listen to one of the writers talk about their frustrations. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This becomes a gig job rather than a stable job. And you were searching all year for your next job and your next job. And taking offers that are less than less than being told by the companies. This is simply what we offer now. I am not living UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm not living in Beverly Hills. It's a struggle for everybody. It's hard, I mean, it's expensive to live in this town. And I think we're all, you know, everybody struggles, everybody's trying to pay bills, everybody's trying to just make a decent living and a decent wage. And I don't think what we're asking for is unfair at all. ELAM:  Now on the other side, the studios are saying is that the business has changed. You're saying they're feeling pressure from Wall Street, to bring down how much they've been spending on all the shows that they're streaming, and all the shows that they're making. And they're saying they don't want to pay to just have writers in the room if they're not working specifically on any show at that time. Of course, this is a very far gap between where they are right now. The last time we saw a strike it was 15 years ago, and it lasted for 100 days. And as we had estimates of costing some $2 billion or so.  Right now, where they are, they're not even sure if they're even close to getting to a deal. I'm told by the chief negotiator for the WGA. But as far as the people who watch the shows, the people who consume these shows, it's impacting already, because we've seen the late-night talk shows already go to black.  They are saying they will be black as long as this strike is happening. So that means Seth Meyers, I mean Stephen Colbert, that means the Daily Show and Saturday Night Live, all dark for now. As far as TV shows and movies, a lot of those are already pre-produced and already in the can. But if this drags on for a long time, then some of the favorite shows that people like to watch could be impacted, you might see seasons delayed. All of that is down the line. But for now, this is what the Writers Guild of America says they need to do to get their fair share of pay. Stephanie Elam, CNN Hollywood. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. In 1955, mathematician John McCarthy coined what term? Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Metaverse or 3D Printing? AI had a number of early contributors to the concept, but McCarthy is credited with coming up with the name. The advancement of AI technology has been so swift that many of us can look at something today and question, is that real or not? Especially when it comes to photos, videos, text and music, to name a few. Well, Geoffrey Hinton, also known as the Godfather of AI, decided he had to blow the whistle on this technology he helped develop. He made headlines for leaving his role at Google last week because he wanted to speak more openly about his growing concerns around AI. Hinton said, AI has the potential to eliminate jobs and create a world where many will, "not be able to know what is true anymore." Our Anna Stewart has more on Hinton's warnings. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER:  The chorus of critics, warning about the risks of AI are growing louder. And this particular voice comes from Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer of the technology. His work on Neural Networks provided a key foundation for many of the AI applications that you see today. Now, he has quit his job, and he's tweeted that he left so that he could talk about the dangers of AI without considering how that impacts Google. Adding that Google has acted very responsibly. And for its part, Google says it remains committed to a responsible approach. Hinton says he's concerned that people won't be able to distinguish what's real, and what AI generated or manipulated by the internet. And that includes music, videos, texts, photos, and we are seeing examples of this a lot. Hinton also expressed concern about the impact AI will have on people's jobs. And that comment came as the CEO of IBM in an interview with Bloomberg said, AI may replace up to 30% around 7800 of their back-office jobs. Finally, Hinton says AI could become smarter than people and pose a threat to humanity. And he now thinks that will happen much sooner than he had once thought. Now, all this, he says, has been exacerbated by huge competition by the big tech companies. There's open AI, there's Microsoft, Google, IBM, Amazon, Baidu, Tencent, all racing to position themselves in the AI space. But Hinton thinks perhaps there should be a pause. He says scientists should really work together at this stage to control the technology, saying, I don't think they should scale this up more, until they have understood whether they can control it. Anna Stewart, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: All right, today's story, getting a 10 out of 10 is the one and only Lewis Hamilton widely considered as the goat, the Greatest Of All Time in Formula One racing. He has more wins than any other driver ever and a record tying Seven World Championships. He started driving karts as a kid and some people would make fun of him because he couldn't afford a fancy kart like other racers, but Lewis' dad said, son, let your racing do the talking. And today Lewis has built himself into a legend with hard work, dedication and belief in himself. You know, youngsters today, they see social media and they think success is easy. And it's overnight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LEWIS HAMILTON, FORMULA ONE, RACE CAR DRIVER:  Yeah. WIRE:  Not true. I think it's really important that they see legends like you had to grind before you shine. What was one of the jobs coming up when you look back, he's kind of giggled about it? HAMILTON:  Cleaning cars probably. I was cleaning -- I was cleaning cars for like a dealer in town. I worked at a close clothing store. And I worked at a sneaker, sneaker store when I was like JD Sports when I was a kid. So, I tried a bunch of different things. But I was always -- when I was at work, all I was thinking of is, how I'm going to win the next race. And yeah, I think you're right today I think people do see successful people on social media and taught them how to understand, how much grafting it takes to become -- to get to a good place and -- but the crazy thing is I'm -- I'm in my, what, my 17th year of this sport, and doing 30 years, I'm still grafting. I'm still having to chip away. I'm still having to work like never before to be able to excel in a sport that's constantly evolving. The competition is constantly rising; it's getting more and more -- it's getting tougher and tougher by the year. You just got to have the winning mindset and also that belief in yourself that you will get there no matter how many times you fall. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Awesome stuff. You can see Lewis on TV, zoom in at speeds of up to 200 miles per hour this weekend right here in Miami as he keeps chasing greatness. Hope something in today's show helps you chase your greatness as well. Great potential lies within. Special shout out is going to the Assets School in Honolulu, Hawaii, aloha and many blessings to you. I'm Coy Wire and we are CNN 10. END230505

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello lovely people. It's Friday, Friyay, hope the fourth was with you yesterday, wishing you a happy Cinco de Mayo today. I do want to apologize though, I forgot about Your Word Wednesday, reporting from Miami everything was a bit higgledy-piggledy. So today I promised to work something you posted on my social media into this show. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start with the alleged drone attack on Russia's Kremlin. The Kremlin is a complex located in the center of Moscow, and it's often used to refer to the Russian government. Check out this video, appearing to show two drones flying towards the Kremlin early Wednesday morning, exploding on its dome. Russia claims Ukraine sent the drones to kill Russian President Vladimir Putin. They say nobody was killed or injured in the alleged attack. And the Kremlin spokesperson says Putin wasn't in the building. Here's Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, responding to these allegations. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT:  We don't attack Putin or Moscow. We fight on our territory. We're defending our villages and cities. We don't have, you know, enough weapon for this. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Now, Russia then claimed that the United States was involved in the attack. But on CNN, John Kirby, the Coordinator for Strategic Communications at the National Security Council in the White House, denied U.S. involvement and accused President Putin spokesperson of lying. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS COORDINATOR:  I would just tell you Mr. Peskov's lying. I mean, it's obviously a ludicrous claim. The United States had nothing to do with this. We don't even know what happened here. Kaitlan. But I can assure you, the United States had no role in it whatsoever. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  U.S. officials have also said they were still assessing this incident and had no information about who might have been responsible if there was an attack. Ten second trivia. Charles III is now the King of the United Kingdom. But who's next in line for the throne? Prince Harry, Prince William, Prince George or Princess Charlotte? Prince William, the eldest son of King Charles is on deck to be the next king. Earlier in the week, we told you about the big event happening this Saturday at Westminster Abbey in London, the coronation of King Charles III and his wife Camilla, Queen Consort.  Charles III has been the heir to the British throne for 70 years but ever since his Mother Queen Elizabeth II passed away in September. Preparation for this historic event has been in overdrive expect lots of pomp and circumstance and his highly anticipated tradition. But things have changed quite a bit since Queen Elizabeth's coronation way back in 1950s, the new leader of the British monarchy is facing a completely different Britain and with changes in societal demographics, minority ethnic groups rising and more religious diversity in the nation. Questions have been raised about the relevance of the monarchy in today's modern U.K. Our Bianca Nobilo has more for us from London. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And heavier indeed for the revelers who welcome Britain's coronation here in Piccadilly. BIANCA NOBILO, CNN CORRESPONDENT & ANCHOR:  The longest interlude between two coronations in British history. Decades of demographic, religious and societal change, raising questions about the relevance of the monarchy today, 1953 was full of post-war joie de vivre and excitement about a new young queen. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They've come to seek work in Britain. NOBILO:  Despite waves of historic migration, Britain in the 1950s was overwhelmingly white, Christian and divided along class lines in society and the halls of power. Today, three of the four great offices of state including the Prime Minister are from minority backgrounds, 20% of the population today are from ethnic minority backgrounds too and rising, many from countries subject to exploitation in the former British Empire. BIDISHA MAMATA, COLUMNIST:  The monarchy itself has to find a respectful and humble place for itself without pretending that it doesn't have all of its privilege, all of its history and all of its baggage. NOBILO:  Though crumbling slowly after the Second World War, Britain was still stratified along class lines in the 1950s. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  German tales denote rank, a duchess for example wears Rose. NOBILO:  Modern Britain is in many ways allergic to the idea of inherited privilege. Society at least strives to be egalitarian. But a recent poll commissioned by the BBC, Britain's National Broadcaster suggests that King Charles might have a problem appealing to young people, 38% of whom said that they would support an elected head of state and indifference might be a problem too, 78% said they weren't interested in the royal family. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think it's definitely time to rethink and I know a lot of people loved Queen Elizabeth. And I don't think that same fondness is there for King Charles. NOBILO:  The monarchs since the 16th century is also titular head of the Church of England. In 1953, the majority of the country was Christian. Today, it is half that with the number of non-religious and non-Christian faiths rising each year with multi-faith leaders playing a role in the coronation for the first time. King Charles, who has declared himself to be defender of all faiths was honored here at Britain's largest mosque ahead of the coronation. So could this be an opportunity for all communities in Britain to come together? SABAH AHMEDI, IMAM:  Within Islam, we're taught that part of your faith is loyalty to your nation. And we also know that the coronation is part of the history of this nation, and our citizens, we respect that history. NOBILO:  The coronation is a litmus test for how King Charles will be received by 2023 Britain and whether enthusiasm, apathy or opposition to the monarchy will shape his reign. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  The Met Gala, the annual fundraising gala benefiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in New York City, has traditionally been timed to mark the opening of its annual fashion exhibition. Well, today's story getting a 10 out of 10, the cockroach who crashed the red carpet. Jeanne Moos has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  With so many celebs at the Met Gala dressed up like designer Karl Lagerfeld's cat, it's a wonder a cockroach dared to scurry up the red carpet. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No. MOOS:  But there it was getting treated like a celebrity. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Get a photo. Kevin gets a photo. MOOS:  Variety captured a Getty photographer blinding the roach with his flash, a roach that made people which called it The Surprise Star of the 2023 Met Gala. Others called it best dressed. It arrived fashionably late, showing up before the last guest Rihanna. Naturally, someone had to ask about its outfit. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What are you wearing? MOOS:  But fashion was a subject this roach wouldn't broach, it disappeared only to reappear on the banister. You'd think it was a raft instead of a roach, the way the crowd reacted. Photographer Kevin Mazur at one point jokingly pretended to stomp on it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No. MOOS:  Then accidentally kicked it around but that didn't stop it. And then Variety tweeted out the alarming news. It is with deep sadness that we must report the Met Gala cockroach was stepped on. And thus does a join other bug. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's coming from the health sector. Holy, I just swallow the bee. MOOS:  That have given their lives so very publicly. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nice. MOOS:  We will remember you; you fleet footed fashionista with panache smashed on the red carpet. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Poor fella, rest in pieces. No time for melancholy though. It's a fantastic Friday and today's winners for Your Word Wednesday vocabulary submissions are @Kara J. Cochran in Villa Madonna Academy. Melancholy, a noun or adjective meaning a feeling of pensive sadness. And Mr. Veces (ph) and Mrs. Schweitzer's (ph) class at Bridge Valley, their word was Higgledy- piggledy, an adjunctive meeting involving confusion or disorder. Well done.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. Hope you had a wonderful weekend. Looking forward to starting this week strong with you. Let's start this show with the hottest ticket in town, which was the coronation of King Charles III at Westminster Abbey in London. About 2200 people, including royal family members, celebrities, faith leaders and heads of state from around the world were there to see 74-year-old King Charles officially crowned into the royal lineage of the British monarchy with his 22-carat gold 360-year-old crown.  It'd been 70 years since the last coronation when King Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II took the crown. His wife Camilla received her own coronation as well as Queen. Like her husband, she was anointed with holy oil by the Archbishop of Canterbury before having Queen Mary's crown placed on her head. Senior royals Prince William and wife Princess Catherine were there. Prince Harry as well, but without his wife Meghan who reportedly stayed in the U.S. with their children.  After the ceremony, there was a massive procession from Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace with about 4000 troops escorting the King and Queen. The newly anointed monarch and the Queen waved as thousands of spectators packed the streets of London to get a glimpse of the royal couple.  But this pageantry saw some feathers ruffled as well. Antimonarchy demonstrators were also present wearing yellow t-shirts, booing and shouting, not my king. London's Metropolitan police said it had made more than 50 arrests during the coronation from these protests.  Our Max Foster has more on this piece of history in the making.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: A day of destiny, the patient prince crowned at last. Charles III, king of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms. London stood still as well-wishers lined the streets, huddled in the rain to join the celebration of British monarchy. Leaders, dignitaries, family members and celebrities, more than 2000 gathered in Westminster Abbey for this once in a generation event. Prince Harry entered alongside other royals, including Prince Andrew, Prince Edward, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.  The Prince and Princess of Wales arrived behind the King and Queen and followed them into the Abbey in what appeared to be a break from the schedule. King and Queen, married in 2005, arrived in splendor. The couple wore their respective robes estates Camilla in the robe of state originally made for Queen Elizabeth II. The deeply religious ceremony moved through several stages. First, the recognition. Charles faced the four points of a compass symbolically presenting himself to the people.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I here present unto you King Charles.  FOSTER: Breaking from tradition, Charles read a prayer aloud.  KIND CHARLES III:  We may discover the ways of gentleness and be led into the paths of peace. FOSTER: Another first, a gospel choir. Before the oath, Charles acknowledged the role of the Church of England to foster an environment in which people of all faiths and beliefs may live freely.  KIND CHARLES III: I will. FOSTER: 70 years since his mother before him, Charles fulfills his destiny and takes his place in the holy lineage of kings and queens. Made for the last King Charles in 1661, the sovereign crown comprises solid gold set with rubies and sapphires and other gems. Would the crown fit?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: God saved the king.  CROWD: God saved the king. FOSTER: Queen Camilla received her own coronation. Like her husband, she was anointed with holy oil and the keeper of the jewel house. Then presented the consort's ring, marrying her to the king, to God, and their people.  From Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace, a vast procession of 4000 ceremonial troops accompanied the royals into a new era, a new Britain, ruled by its newly crowned monarch. Max Foster, CNN, Buckingham Palace, London.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. Which of these institutions is currently led by Jerome Powell? The Federal Reserve, the FBI, Princeton University, or J.P. Morgan? Jerome Powell is the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve, which is the central bank in the United States. For the past year, we've seen the Federal Reserve repeatedly trying to tame soaring inflation by hiking up interest rates.  Well, the Fed did it again for the 10th consecutive time since last March. The continued raising of the interest rates is hurting Americans pockets, especially when it comes to paying for mortgages, car loans and credit card bills. Our Christine Romans is here to break it all down for us.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: The Federal Reserve has raised rates ten times over the past year. That target interest rate from the Fed influences a lot of other borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, business loans. The Fed's attempt to tame inflation raises costs for all Americans. Let's look at how it's felt in your household budget.  The rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 4.16% back when the rate hike started over a year ago. Today it's 6.39%. So on a $500,000 loan with 20% down, that works out to be more than $500 extra a month.  New car loans have jumped from four and a half percent last year to almost 7% on a six year auto loan. That means the monthly car payment is $63 more expensive for the same car.  The Fed's rate hikes make credit card debt even more dangerous and expensive to carry. Average credit card rates have soared from 14 and a half percent, already high to a record above 20%. So if you pay just a minimum on $2,000 balance say, it'll take you nearly eleven more months to pay it off because of the rising interest rates. More recently, the Fed has signaled a potential pause in new rate hikes. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Today's story, getting a 10 out of 10, the wildest prom arrival we've ever seen. You've heard of limos, buses, vintage cars, horse drawn carriages, but have you ever heard of someone showing up to prom in a tank? Not a tank top, but like a legit tank, an armored one. Jeanne Moos has more.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  This is how Washington State resident Sherman Bynum made his entrance at the Camus High School prom in the turrets of a World War II tank., UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Sherman, are you happy?  SHERMAN BYNUM, CAMAS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT:  Heck, yeah.  We're kind of tired of seeing sports cars, limousines, the average ride, but also as a teenage boy, I mean, I like tanks.  MOOS: It was offloaded near the prom venue, the treads rubberized to avoid damage in roads. A bagpiper known as the Unipiper served as an escort. Sherman, no relation to the tank, used a GoFundMe page to raise the $1,000 needed to rent the tank from a collector who did the driving. As for Sherman's date. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He asked me with a sign that said, I'd be thankful to take you to prom with me. And it was perfect.  MOOS: Perfect, though to protect her gown. BYNUM: She did not want to sit inside of the tank. That was not something she was interested in at all. Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  But dude, she was like, no, thank you. She's not riding that thing. Many thanks to all of you who have subscribed and have been commenting on our CNN 10 YouTube Channel. I wish there was a way for us to get to every single one of you.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, lovely people. Happy Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news. We start today with a tough topic, a controversial one that leaves many in the United States divided. It's the ongoing debate about gun control.  This comes after a mass shooting unfolded at a shopping mall in Allen, Texas, about 25 miles north of Dallas. Eight people were killed at least seven others wounded at the time of this reporting.  According to the Gun Violence Archive, the United States has suffered at least mass shootings within the first five months of this year. This non-  profit group and CNN define a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are shot. Vigils and church services were set up in the city of Allen in support of the victims and their families as investigators were searching for answers. In response to the tragedy, Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott focused on the need for better help with mental health, stating, quote: We are working to address that anger and violence by going to its root cause, which is addressing the mental health problems behind it, unquote. Abbott also added, quote: People want a quick solution. The long-term solution here is to address the mental health issue, unquote. For his part, President Biden on Sunday asked Congress to pass new gun control laws. Our Jeremy Diamond has more for us from the White House on the president's reaction and his continued call for actions on gun reform. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: The flag above the White House is once again flying at half staff, as we watch this all too familiar ritual in the wake of yet another deadly mass shooting play out. President Biden putting out a statement offering his prayers to the victims and their families and also thanking first responders for acting quickly and courageously. He says that federal law enforcement officials are offering assistance to state and local authorities. But what we're also hearing from President Biden is once again a call to action a call to enact the kind of common sense gun reforms that President Biden believes are necessary.  And he's also making clear who he believes is responsible for the inaction on those efforts in Washington, saying in a statement, quote: Too many families have empty chairs at their dinner tables. Republican members of Congress cannot continue to meet this epidemic with a shrug. Tweeted thoughts and prayers are not enough.  Once again, I asked Congress to send me a bill banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Enacting universal background checks. Requiring safe storage. Ending immunity for gun manufacturers. I will sign it immediately. We need nothing less to keep our streets safe. And President Biden in this statement also says that he believes the country has made some progress in addressing this issue, pointing to his signing of that bipartisan safer communities act that sought to incentivize more red flag laws in the country and address mental health resources, but he also makes clear that he believes that despite the nearly two dozen executive actions he has signed on this issue, he believes he's now reached the limit of his executive authorities and he says that the burden now rests with Congress.  Jeremy Diamond, CNN, the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: We head to Asia now where Japanese President Fumio Kishida made a historic visit to Seoul to meet South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol. It's the first time a Japanese leader has visited the capital in more than a decade, both nations look to strengthen relations while facing a growing threat from North Korea. Our Paula Hancocks has more from Seoul. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Japan and South Korea appear to be moving closer together at least at the government and leadership level. Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has ended a two-day visit to Seoul to meet his South Korean counterpart Yoon Suk Yeol. And there were a number of important issues on the agenda North Korea and security issues in the region but also historical issues which date back to the time when Japan colonized Korea. Now, for example, forced labor during wartime. This is an issue that President Yoon has been trying to resolve. He has come under domestic criticism for that in a belief by some. Certainly, the more liberal part of the country that he is offering more concessions to Japan than he is receiving in return.  Now there were some hopes from the liberals that there would be another apology from Japan's side for the colonial times. There was not but there was a personal message of sympathy from Japan's prime minister. FUMIO KISHIDA, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER (through translator): My heart aches as many people went through a very difficult and sad experience in the harsh environment at that time. HANCOCKS: Now, President Yoon said that there was a need to dispel the perception that Japan and South Korea could not take a single step forward until all the historical issues had been completely resolved.  Now, North Korea was also a very important issue and the increasing threat from the North. Now, we have heard repeatedly from Washington that they would like to see their two allies in the region move closer together. Now, we have seen and heard from both leaders that they are information sharing. That there is more of a security sharing process when it comes to the missile threat from North Korea and that is certainly being welcomed by Washington. Here's President Yoon. YOON SUK YEOL, SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Prime Minister Kishida and I shared the recognition that North Korea's nuclear and missile development poses a grave threat to peace and stability not only on the Korean peninsula and Japan but also throughout the world. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Ten-second trivia:  The French word pain translates to which of these food items? Bread, milk, eggs or beans? On your grocery list, the French to English translation for pain is bread. Now, when it comes to finding authentic French bakeries, Rhode Island maybe not the first place you'd look. But looky here, one French baker named Belinda Quinn will make you think a wee bit different about the Ocean State. She came from Paris, opened a bakery in Newport and her shop sells out within hours of opening every weekend.  I sure hope my pate a croissants with it someday. Belinda, the French baker shares with us some of the secrets to the scrumptiousness of the pain au chocolat. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BELINDA QUINN, CO-FOUNDER, LE BEC SURCE: We open at 7:00 and then we usually set out by 9:30, if not sometimes by 8:00, 8:30.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I come here pretty much every weekend. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I usually get here at around 6:30.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's always a line. I got here at 5:00 to 7:00 this morning, and there was already 20 people in line.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I had no idea that it would be so incredible.  QUINN: It is quite difficult to make a good pain au chocolat at home if we don't have the equipment, the ingredients and also the patients. You have to be really patient to make a good pain au chocolat. I met my husband in Paris and I decided to follow him and then to move to the U.S. When I came to Newport, my first impression was you the food it was very different here and there is nothing for me authentic. So that's why I decided I should really bring a touch of French. I knew that it would work because I knew that people they would know the difference. They would taste the quality. This is the day one when we mix all the ingredients and we make it into a dough. Day two, you do the lamination. You put -- you incorporate the butter in the dough and then you shape the pain au chocolat.  It's a French butter because there is a high content of fat. If you use the wrong type of butter, it won't create any layers in the pastry.  All right, this is like 30 something layers. And then day three, it's where you proof and you bake the particular. So what makes the perfect pain au chocolate for me is when you buy in it, you have to taste this crispy crunchy layer on top and then inside, you have to have this very light and flaky dough, and then the taste of dark chocolate. Some people, they would just tell me, reading that this is like being in Paris again. I am proud of my French culture. I wanted to create my Le Bec Sucre to have this taste of French. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa is one of the best known artworks in the world, right? But one thing that hasn't been known, the mystery of the location shown in the background of the iconic 16th century painting. Today's story getting a 10 out of 10, the puzzle has potentially been solved. Using virtual reconstruction and historical documents, art historian Silvano Vinceti claims the bridge behind Mona Lisa is the Romito Bridge in the Tuscany region of Italy, in the town of Laterina.  Problem is the Tuscan village of Ponte Buriano nearby is so convinced that the Mona Lisa bridge is in their village, that they've made it a key feature of their local tourism campaign. Looks like this mystery that's been debated for centuries just got more heated. Did you know that the Mona Lisa was once accused of a crime? She was framed. Now, she's in the Louvre Museum in Paris, seen by millions of people every year. Our special shout out today is going to Winter Garden, Florida, West Orange High School.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, hello. And welcome to Wednesday #YourWordWednesday. Follow me @coywire on Insta, Snapchat and TikTok and put your unique vocabulary word in the comment section of my most recent post. And we'll choose a winner to work in to tomorrow's show. Let's go.  We start today with the end of a controversial border policy. It's called Title 42. It's expected to expire tomorrow, May 11, and communities along the U.S.-Mexico border are bracing for a surge that's been months in the making. CNN took video from Mexico's side of the border yesterday, and a source says the U.S. government estimates more than 150,000 people in Mexico alone may be standing by to enter the U.S. when Title 42 expires.  Many politicians, like Texas Governor Greg Abbott, say the situation along the border is already overwhelming. The policy started at the beginning of the COVID pandemic, allowing border officials to quickly turn away migrants at the U.S.-Mexico. border over concerns about the virus. Migrants were either returned to their home countries or sent back to Mexico. According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency, authorities have denied migrants at the U.S. Southern border more than 2.8 million times since the policy began.  The policy is going away now as the Biden administration is ending the COVID public health emergency. The Department of Homeland Security released a six-pillar plan that outlines the department's operations post Title 42, including setting up additional facilities along the border to process migrants. Still, there are many concerns. The House of Representatives are expected to vote tomorrow on Republicans wide ranging border security package. The bill would, in part mandate that migrants remain in Mexico while going through the asylum process and beef up security at the southern border and restart border wall construction. At the border, migrants are traveling through treacherous conditions at times, including battling extreme heat. Many are looking to enter America for a chance for a better life. This week, CNN spoke up with a few migrants on their journey. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  She says they were four days on this train, she says, horrible, really cold.  He says four kids, his wife, four and a half days on the train.  He says, it's for the American dream. And they're going to try to cross today. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Now, how to handle the border is a divisive topic. As you can see, there are many concerns to consider. Emily Schmidt is reporting. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EMILY SCHMIDT, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Migrant Demario Jones sees crossing the border as a singular mission.  DEMARIO JONES, MIGRANT FROM JAMAICA:  Just want to go to the U.S. to get a work, to change my life and live a good life.  SCHMIDT:  But border communities say an increase in migrants is an exponentially larger problem.  MAYOR DOUG NICHOLLS, (R) YUMA, ARIZONA:  This task is going to be too great. SCHMIDT:  Yuma's mayor says a month ago, 300 people a day crossed the border near his community. Sunday, he says there were a thousand.  GOV. KATIE HOBBS, (D) ARIZONA:  The federal government is unprepared to meet the demands of the expected influx.  SCHMIDT:  The Governor of Texas launched a border response team because he claims the federal government isn't doing enough.  GOV. GREG ABBOTT, (R) TEXAS:  While Texas is doing everything possible to try to stop people from crossing the border, at the very same time the President of the United States is setting -- putting out the welcome act.  SCHMIDT:  Texas has bused migrants to places like New York City, which now wants to send some to nearby Rockland County, New York.  ED DAY, ROCKLAND COUNTY, EXECUTIVE:  We cannot put the needs of the people who are being sent here ahead of our own residents.  SCHMIDT:  The county executive declared a state of emergency, requiring New York City to cover costs of any migrants. Republicans in the House have put forth a bill to extend current policies, but which the White House says would make the situation worse. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The bill, H.R.2 would be a disaster. For border security and a Christmas morning gift for human smugglers.  SCHMIDT:  The bill is scheduled for a vote the same day Title 42 is scheduled to expire, and unlikely to pass the Democratic controlled Senate. I'm Emily Schmidt reporting.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  With Title 42 expected to expire tomorrow and the expected surge in border crossings, the Biden administration is making plans to send an additional 1500 active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border in anticipation of the influx of migrants. As I mentioned earlier, the federal government estimates that more than 150,000 migrants were waiting in shelters and in streets in northern Mexican states bordering the U.S. this past weekend alone. Our Rosa Flores has more from the border.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Border communities across the U.S.-Mexico border already seeing a spike in migration, according to community leaders. In Brownsville, one respite center went from receiving up to 300 migrants per day two weeks ago to a thousand. In McAllen, from 150 to 400. In Laredo from 50 to 250 during the same time period, 25,000 migrants are in immigration custody, according to a Homeland Security official. And total migrant encounters on the U.S. Southern border now surpasses 8000 per day.  And this is the scene by the border wall in El Paso where hundreds of people are way to turn themselves into immigration authorities, a flow that's expected to spike once Title 42 expires Thursday. And thousands more are already living on El Paso city streets. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is ground zero for the immigration.  FLORES:  Pastor Timothy Pereya (ph) has been delivering between 900 and 1100 warm meals a day. As migrants here rely on the kindness of strangers for everything.  RAUL ORTIZ, DEPUTY CHIEF, U.S. BORDER PATROL:  With respect to the DoD personnel. FLORES:  Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz says the 1500 active-duty troops deployed by the Biden administration to assist with administrative tasks are headed to El Paso for now. ORTIZ:  I'm going to be able to reallocate those to some of the other sectors that require some additional capacity. So we're going to be able to balance that out. We've got a plan.  FLORES:  Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas says the administration's border policies are not to blame.  ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  We urge Congress to fix our broken immigration system, and until then, we will do everything that we can. FLORES:  While Washington squabbles about who is at fault, its border churches and nonprofits were left helping fill in the gaps.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Imagine if you could recreate some of the most delicious dishes from star chefs from around the world. Well, food technology startup CloudChef is aiming to make this a reality using cameras and sensors in a chef's kitchen so that their gustatory greatness can be replicated for a price, of course. Let's see what our Vanessa Yurkevich has cooking. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Nikhil Abraham is on a mission to recreate some of the world's finest dishes with some computerized help.  NIKHIL ABRAHAM, CLOUDCHEF CO-FOUNDER, CEO:  What we did was build technology where a chef can come into one of our kitchens, be it from your favorite restaurant in Paris or even from your grandmother. And we can then recreate this recipe without the chef.  YURKEVICH:  Abraham and his co-founders developed this specialized software and are putting it to use in a new startup kitchen called CloudChef.  ABRAHAM:  We start with Indian food because we were missing some of our favorite restaurants from back home. YURKEVICH:  Chef Annika Goldbulli (ph) is testing the technology, as she cooks sensors record the entire process, breaking it down into thousands of data points.  ABRAHAM:  You have cameras looking at the contents of the pan, looking at colors, in some cases, textures. There are infrared cameras figuring out how hot each individual item is.  YURKEVICH:  After her dish is recorded, it can be reproduced at any of the sensor powered stations. And the results. (On camera):  I can't taste a difference in it. Literally everything is duplicated.  (Voice-over):  Chefs receive a royalty every time one of their dishes is ordered. Right now, CloudChef has dishes from Michelin starred chefs available for pickup and delivery in Palo Alto, California. But they are looking to expand their kitchens and menus soon by bringing the world's greatest cuisine to your home.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. Australia gets its name from the Latin word Australis, meaning what? Island, Southern. Eastern, or Humid?  Australis means southern, which is befitting for the land down under.  Let's head down under to Australia now, where some cool kangaroos are getting today's 10 out of 10. Parts of southeastern Australia getting the coldest day in May on record over the weekend. And kangaroos at Namagdi National Park were hopping in a winter wonderland. Winter in Australia usually starts in June, so snowfall this early, wow. It's pretty rare.  That's about all we have time for today. Our special shout out goes to Western Hills University High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. We see you. Let's make this an awesome day. The most impactful factor determining our success over time is our state of mind. Stay humble, stay hungry and shine bright today, baby. I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10. END230511

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey there. And happy Thursday. Hope you're rocking and rolling, dominating the week. We're almost at the end of it. It's Friday eve, so let's keep going strong. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, and our top story today is the debt ceiling debate, a topic that it continues to cause quite the kerfuffle between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. Quick recap the debt ceiling is the limit, the total amount of money that the U.S. government is authorized to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations, paying for things like military salaries, Medicare benefits, Social Security, interest on national debt, and even tax refunds. That credit limit currently sits at an eye-popping figure of more than $31 trillion. The debt ceiling was last raised in December of 2021, and that ceiling is expected to last until at least this summer. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen even warned of a, "economic catastrophe" if the U.S. fails to raise its debt ceiling in the coming weeks. House Republicans recently passed a bill to increase the debt limit by $1.5 trillion, but it's expected that that proposal will get no love when it gets to the Democratic controlled Senate. President Joe Biden hosted debt limit talks with congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday. But did they break any new ground on the debt ceiling negotiations? Our Lauren Fox was in Washington, D.C. And is reporting on the ongoing struggle between the parties.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT:  Folks, welcome.  LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The path to avoiding a catastrophic default still unclear, even after yesterday's hour-long Oval Office meeting.  REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R) HOUSE SPEAKER:  I didn't see any new movement. The President said the staff should get back together, but I was very clear with the president, we have now just two weeks to go.  FOX:  President Biden offering a different assessment.  BIDEN:  Everyone agreed that deficit to falling, the debt is off the table.  Oh, I know we have the time. I mean, we could do it easily if they -- if -- but we do we have the will? FOX:  Neither side appears to be budging. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy once again rejecting the President's call to pass a clean bill to lift the debt limit.  MCCARTHY:  Whatever goes forward is not just going to be raising the debt ceiling. It's going to be just like we did in the House. We will raise the debt ceiling with doing changes within our spending.  FOX:  House Republicans recently passed a bill to increase the debt limit by $1.5 trillion while cutting domestic programs to trim the deficit. It has no path, however, of passing the Democratic controlled Senate.  SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) MAJORITY LEADER:  What's really troubling about the Speaker's position is, it's a partisan bill, and he says, take it or leave it, or we could default.  FOX:  President Biden contemplating a workaround to raise the debt ceiling without the help of Congress.  BIDEN:  I have been considering the 14th Amendment. And a man I have enormous respect for, Larry Tribe, who advised me for a long time, thinks that it would be legitimate. But the problem is it would have to be litigated.  FOX:  Meanwhile, Senate Republicans indicating they'll be staying on the sidelines with no plans to step in to try in broker deal.  SEN. MITT ROMNEY, (R) UTAH:  It's time for the President of the United States to take action to make sure that we don't have a default in the debt. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, here comes the sun. Scientists say they've successfully produced a nuclear your fusion reaction, which replicates the processes that happen on the sun and that they may have found the holy grail of clean energy. They aimed 192 powerful laser beams at a point, and it was at that point that a star was born.  But, is it safe? Is it sustainable? And can we harness that energy in a way that we can then use it and become less dependent on burning fossil fuels and less reliant on the current electrical grid? Our Bill Weir has more.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT:  Inside this building, some very smart people built a star on Earth. Not the Hollywood kind. That's easy. No, the burning ball of gas in the sky kind. One of the hardest things human humans have ever tried. TAMMY MA, PHYSICIST, LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY:  I was at the airport when my boss called me and I burst into tears.  WEIR:  Tammy Ma is among the scientists who have been chasing nuclear fusion for generations.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Countdown for a shot. On my mark. Three, two, unmarked. WEIR:  And in the middle of a December night, they did it.  (On camera):  And you only need a tiny little bit of fuel? MA:  That's right, yes. Because our little pellet that sits right in the middle, you can't even see on this target, is just two millimeters in diameter.  WEIR:  That target includes an abundant isotope found in seawater and goes into a chamber about the size of a beach ball in the 60s, but is now a round room, 30 feet across with 192 massive lasers aimed at the center.  MA:  They're big laser beams, about 40 by 40 centimeters. Each one alone is one of the most energetic in the world. Every time we do a shot, it's a thousand times the power of the entire U.S. Electrical grid.  WEIR:  Wow. MA:  But your lights don't flicker at home when we take a shot. So we're doing is taking a huge amount of energy and compressing it down, just in 10 nanoseconds.  WEIR:  Right.  MA:  So it's about $14 of electricity.  WEIR:  The National Ignition Facility then amplifies all that concentrated energy on the target, and if they get it just right, more energy comes out than went in, with no risk of nuclear meltdown or radioactive waste. MA:  In a fusion power plant, you would shoot the same target over and over at about ten times a second, dropping a target in and shooting it with laser.  WEIR:  So you'd need a target loader. Like a machine gun or something, right? MA:  We need a target loader. Exactly. So there's still many, many technology jumps that we need to make, but that's what makes it so exciting.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia.  Which of these NASA missions launched in 1977?  Skylab, Galileo, Voyager or Viking? Two unmanned spacecraft were launched as part of the Voyager missions in 1977. Speaking of those Voyager probes both lifted off into the galaxy on a mission to observe and then transmit information back to Earth. Info pertaining to the planets and the farthest reaches of the Sun's sphere of influence. Now, many didn't expect it. The twin spacecraft's mission would still be going on today. Nearly 46 years later. CNN sat down with the Voyager project Braintrust as they shared the steps they're taking to ensure that this mission keeps going as long as possible. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUZANNE DODD, VOYAGER PROJECT MANAGER, NASA JET PROPULSION LAB:  For aging spacecraft 46 years now, they're actually very healthy.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have liftoff of the Titan Centaur carrying the first of two Voyager spacecraft to extend man's senses farther into the solar system than ever before.  DODD:  From a scientific standpoint, what's critical about Voyager today is the record of data that it's taking from Earth, right, out through the outer heliosheath, cross the heliopause, and as far into interstellar space as we can make that data last. Because we can see the changes in the data, changes in the environment as we travel further and further away. They were identical at launch. Different things have failed on the spacecraft differently. So if you think of twins, one has lost its hearing and needs some hearing aids, and another one has lost a bit of some sense of touch. But for aging spacecraft 46 years now, they're actually very healthy.  LINDA SPIKE, VOYAGER PROJECT SCIENTIST, NASA JET PROPULSION LAB:  Voyager has instruments remaining on and operating that can measure things like the magnetic field, the electrons, protons, and the particles that are around the spacecraft. A lot going on in a place where you can't really see the particles, but still a lot that we can measure and learn about the environment outside this bubble that's generated by the solar wind.  Slowly, one by one, we'll turn off the science instruments. But even that last instrument that stays on and continues to take data will add to our knowledge about a place that we've never been before.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10, a possible meteorite falling from outer space into someone's bedroom. Ms. Suzy Kop from New Jersey found this four by six-inch metallic rock in her dad's room. She said it blasted through the ceiling and then appears to have bounced off the floor, back up to the ceiling before settling beside the bed. And it was warm when she picked it up. Fortunately, no one was hurt.  Chief Astronomer at The Franklin Institute Derrick Pitts says it could be 4 to 5 billion years old.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DERRICK PITTS, CHIEF ASTRONOMER, THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE:  It's been running around in space all that time? And now it's come to earth and it fell right into their lapse. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Police in Hopewell Township are still investigating, but officials believe it could be from the current meteor shower going on. The Eta Aquariid meteor shower is an annual phenomenon that occurs when the earth approaches a trail of dust and debris left by the famous Halley's Comet in the celestial event. It's set to last through May 27.  Now, thanks to Reagan and Steven at Lincolnview Local Schools, you submitted the winner of #yourwordwednesday. Kerfuffle, did you hear it in the show?

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello lovely people. Happy Friday, Friyay. We made it to the end of the week. Isn't that sweet? I'm coming to you from Orchard Park, New York, home of the Buffalo Bills, for a special project soon to come. We start today with an update on inflation, which is actually lower now than it was a year ago. So, what does that mean? Well, prices across all goods and services have not gone down, but the pace of price increases has slowed. The latest Consumer Price Index, or CPI report is an indicator for the price of a weighted average of consumer goods and services purchased by households. The report showed prices have been falling with appliances, health insurance and used cars. But Americans are still feeling pain with their bills, especially when it comes to groceries, car insurance and even daycare and preschool prices. So, with the latest reports, are we now trending out of the inflation woes? Our Matt Egan has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER:  The inflation fire hasn't been put out, but it does increasingly look contained. Consumer prices jumping by 4.9% year over year in April. That is the smallest increase in exactly two years. There have now been 10 consecutive months of cooling price gains. Unfortunately, though, the pace of the improvement has slowed. It's basically leveled out even though it's currently at a level that is more than twice what the Fed is targeting. Now, on a month over month basis, inflation actually heated up between March and April, though, a lot of that was driven by a spike in used car prices and that spike is not expected to last. I'm digging to the report, there were definitely some positives here, a record price drop on an annual basis for major appliances. And for health insurance on an annual basis, used car prices are actually down. Grocery prices, they're still going up rapidly, but even that has cooled off. On the other hand, car insurance is up more than 15% over the last year. So if you put it all together, inflation is clearly moving in the right direction. But the pace of the progress has slowed. And it's still too early to declare victory on inflation. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. Which of these Canadian provinces is located along the Pacific coast? Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia or Alberta? The westernmost province of Canada is British Columbia, defined by its mountain ranges and Pacific coastline. Let's head to British Columbia now to the Great Bear Rainforest, where the indigenous First Nation community has taken steps to protect their land, marine and wildlife, which includes an extraordinary sighting of a white bear or spirit bear. These protections have impacted the ecosystem and the community's livelihoods in just a few short years. Our Bill Weir gives us a tour from that stunning region. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT:  Behold the Great Bear rainforest, stretching for 250 miles of beautiful solitude along the coast of British Columbia as part of the largest intact coastal temperate rainforest in the world. It is a wilderness, the size of Ireland and home to one of the most extraordinary creatures on the planet. DOUGLAS DEASLOSS, CHIEF COUNCILOR, KITASOO/XAI'XAIS FIRST NATION:  The spirit bear is something that's really unique. When you get a pure white bear coming out of a dark green forest, it just looks really magical. And so, we want to protect that. WEIR:  Spirit bears are actually a subspecies of black bear that due to double recessive gene aren't black at all. But this rare species is just one piece of a vital wilderness. DEASLOSS:  The Great Bear Rainforest is extremely special. I mean, I think it's probably one of the most biodiverse places on the planet. You still get wild things like bears and wolves and abundance of salmon and a bunch of different sea life. You still have old growth forests, and so we want to keep it like that. WEIR:  In the heart of this remote expanse is the town of Klemtu, home to a community of the Kitasoo/Xai'xais First Nation, who've lived and thrived in this region for thousands of years. DEASLOSS:  This river is right close to the community. We get three species of salmon that come up this river, and this is their spawning ground. WEIR:  According to a recent report published by the Kitasoo/Xai'xais, this rich ecosystem suffered from 100 years of unsustainable extraction fish, wildlife and forests from outside interest. DEASLOSS:  So right now, we're just getting ready to enter Kitasoo Bay, and that's the area probably the most important area. WEIR:  In June of 2022, they announced the creation of a marine protected area to preserve the herring stalks that are so vital to both wildlife and the community. DEASLOSS:  Kitasoo Bay was declared by the military chiefs. It was supported by the community, and it was launched so the rest of the world knows about it. We've engaged provincial governments, federal governments. We've engaged stakeholders, letting everyone know that it's closed. We've left the document open to collaborating. WEIR:  But the push to reverse a century's worth of degradation actually started more than two decades ago. In 2000, they released their own land and resource protection and management plan aimed at building an economy based on conservation and non-extractive activities like ecotourism. DEASLOSS:  I think Indigenous knowledge is super important, and I think it needs to be integrated, whether it's wildlife management, fisheries management, ocean management. You know, I think right now we are in a new era of collaboration. We're in this era of reconciliation. And how do we work together? How do indigenous people and non-indigenous people work together? WEIR:  Neighboring First Nations first came together in 2012 to issue a ban on trophy hunting of bears. And five years later, thanks to indigenous led research and analysis, the British Columbian government banned the hunting of grizzly bears across the entire province. DEASLOSS:  That was huge, but we knew we weren't quite finished yet. WEIR:  In July of 2022, just a month after the marine protected area was announced, the government agreed to put a stop to black bear hunting as well. And First Nation leaders say they've now managed to protect half of their territory. DEASLOSS:  We've been working with different levels of government, different levels of stakeholders. It's been a lot of negotiation, a lot of debates, a lot of science, a lot of collaboration. And I would say, yeah, 2022 is probably the first high end that we're able to see some significant progress on some of these files. We have a belief that if you take care of the land, the land will take care of you. And so that's ingrained in all of our work here. It doesn't matter if it's in stewardship, if it's in tourism, if it's in economic development. We want to make sure that we're looking at long-term, sustainable industries, and we want to make sure that we have a place that the world can enjoy.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello everyone. I'm Coy Wire, and welcome to a special extended edition of CNN 10. Now, you may not know this, but this program that you're watching right now started all the way back in 1989 when CNN launched a news program designed for the classroom.  A year later, though, tensions in the Persian Gulf would result in the first major international crisis since the Cold War. In August 1990, Saddam Hussein, the leader of Iraq, ordered an invasion of neighboring Kuwait with the apparent goal of controlling the nation's oil reserves.  The U.S. led response would set the precedent for the use of military force for decades to come. On the brink of what would be known as the Gulf War, journalists were urged to leave Iraq. CNN stayed and became the first network to live broadcast a war.  In this special edition of CNN 10, we'll look back and hear CNN news anchor Bernard Shaw famously say the skies of Baghdad are being illuminated and relive the tense moments during the CNN broadcast as journalists hid under beds to stay live on the air, bombs falling around the city. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was January 1991, the U.S. economy was sinking into recession. Mob boss John Gotti, The Teflon Don had recently been arrested on charges that would lead to life imprisonment. Macaulay Culkin faced off with criminals in the first home alone. And President George H.W. Bush edged towards war in the Persian Gulf. Then one early January morning in Baghdad CNN reported that the sky --  BERNARD SHAW, CNN ANCHOR: The skies over Baghdad have been illuminated. We're seeing bright planes of missile. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And an explosive development near the Persian Gulf, word that Iraq has invaded neighboring State of Kuwait with fighting reported along the border, the residents say that they were awakened by machine gunfire and heavy artillery. For weeks, 100,000 Iraqi troops have been reported massing near the border. Arab countries have been trying this month to defuse this building crisis.  In Washington, the White House is condemning the invasion, calling for Iraq to withdraw its forces immediately. The U.S. is also calling for an emergency U.N. Security Council session.  JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The Security Council passed sanctions no more trade with Iraq, a boycott of Iraqi oil, a ban on arms sales, a ban on financial aid and investment. But will the sanctions work?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today, America stops mulling over its options, reportedly sending United States warplanes and combat troops into Saudi Arabia.  GEORGE H. W. BUSH, PRESIDENT: We seek the immediate, unconditional and complete withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From the beginning of the Gulf crisis, the underlying rationale for stopping Saddam Hussein has been oil. The oil dependent world doesn't want a single man with a big army to control the flow from the Gulf.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: With the Operation Desert Shield deadline less than three weeks away, diplomats and journalists are ready to leap at any trace of activity that might lead to the bargaining table.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Unless Saddam Hussein withdraws from Kuwait by late winter, the U.S. will go to war.  DAVID FRENCH, CNN HOST: The Bush White House now says war with Iraq could begin at any moment. It took six months to come to this, but as our Senior White House Correspondent Charles Bierbauer reports, President Bush believed early on in this crisis that it would ultimately be settled with force. CHARLES BIERBAUER, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: White House officials say even now, Saddam Hussein could avoid a war with a massive pullout of his forces. And yet the Bush administration does not expect that.  CHARLES JACO, CNN SAUDI ARABIA: Good evening, or rather good morning from Saudi Arabia, where it's now a quarter after two in the morning. The latest briefing we've received from the military command here in Saudi Arabia was on the number of troops here and apparently there's a total of 425,000 U.S. Troops here. That's an increase of 10,000 over the last time we were briefed. The total multinational force here on the ground is about 690,000.  FRENCH: With us now is Caspar Weinberger, Secretary of Defense during both Reagan administrations. Mr. Secretary, thank you for coming.  CASPAR WEINBERGER, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: Thank you.  FRENCH: Secretary Weinberger, you were credited with the military buildup which is being put to use but there is one area which has come to a lot of criticism. We have to go to Baghdad, Secretary. We're going to Bernard Shaw in Baghdad.  SHAW: This is -- something is happening outside. Peter Arnett joined me here. What's -- let's describe to our viewers what we're seeing. The skies over Baghdad have been illuminated. We're seeing bright flashes going off all over the sky. Peter?  PETER ARNETT, CNN REPORTER: Well, there's antiaircraft gunfire going into the sky. However, we have not yet heard the sound of bombs landing, but there's tremendous lightning in the sky.  SHAW: I have a sense, Peter, that people are shooting towards the sky and they are not aware or cannot see what they're shooting at. This is extraordinary. We're getting starbursts, seeming starbursts in the black sky. We have not heard any jet plane jet, Peter. ARNETT: No plane. Now these sirens are sounding for the first time. The Iraqis have informed us.  FRENCH: Well, we heard Peter Arnett, our saying the Iraqis have informed us and then we didn't hear anymore. This is probably just a technical glitch. They have four wires there that they can use and those wires can be easily severed or pulled.  Wolf, what have you for us at this moment?  WOLF BLITZER, CNN MILITARY AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Strong indications here at the Pentagon that this war may be beginning right now. That the President may be going on television later this evening to explain what exactly is going on. We've been thinking --  FRENCH: Wolf, let me -- Wolf, let me interrupt -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but we're going back to Baghdad now, because we can and we Peter Arnett. JOHN HOLLIMAN, CNN REPORTER: We are thinning to them.  FRENCH: Please come into us from Baghdad. This is David French in Washington. HOLLIMAN: Hello, Baghdad? ARNETT: Line is dead. They just cut the line.  FRENCH: All right, we've lost that for the moment. Back to the Pentagon again. Wolf, you were just reporting that there is new activity level --  HOLLIMAN: Hello Atlanta? Atlanta, this is Holliman. I don't know whether you're able to hear me now or not, but I'm going to continue to talk to you as long as I can. There have been some sirens here tonight, but we still have seen no signs of any airplane coming in here. All we are seeing is the Iraqi response from the ground. Many trace arounds that you can perhaps hear the sound of bombs in the background. I'm going to put our microphone out the window, I think you'll be able to hear this sound.  The night sky of Baghdad, the time here about 20 minutes until 3:00 in the morning. I'm getting away from the window. I'm going to turn off the microphone for one moment in an attempt to see if we can hear Atlanta and get some response from CNN down the line.  FRENCH: All right, we're not immediately able to pick up to resume that sound from John Holliman's position, so we will now return to the Pentagon, where Wolf Blitzer has some more for us. Wolf?  BLITZER: Yes, David. Only moments ago, before I came into the studio here at the Pentagon, I had a chance to see two very Senior Pentagon officials almost running through the halls, going up to Secretary Cheney's office. Let's go back to Baghdad and see what John Holliman is reporting, in the meantime. HOLLIMAN: There's a response here as if the city were under attack. The night sky filled with a hail of bullets and from antiaircraft guns, and off in the distance you can hear what appears to be bombs of some kind hitting the ground, or perhaps artillery shells hitting the ground. There are loud reports, and you can feel the building of this very well-built hotel shaking underneath us as the attack apparently continues.  Hi there, is it possible to call United States, please?  FRENCH: An open microphone from Baghdad, from the hotel now being -- hotel room now being left, we believe, by Bernard Shaw, Peter Arnett, John Holliman and their support staff there. There is a bomb shelter in that hotel. We heard them report earlier today.  Back to the Pentagon, and Wolf Blitzer.  BLITZER: David, all day long we've been hearing rumors that the attack would start at night, Baghdad time, that the attack, if it did come, would try to take advantage of U.S. night fighting equipment, especially with the radar evading stealth fighters. And that is backed up by indications that we're getting here in the Pentagon of stepped-up activity among the senior civilian and military staff.  FRENCH: Wolf, we can still hear John Holliman in Baghdad. And we'll go listen, and he can't hear me, but we can hear him. All right, we're told he can. Let's listen now. HOLLIMAN: David, a miracle has happened. We are now able to hear you as well. My colleague Peter Arnett and I are here at our CNN Baghdad Bureau. You have no idea, David French, how nice it is to hear your voice on this remarkable night. Peter, let's tell our viewers what's happened here. You've had a lot of experience with being under attack, of course, from Vietnam and other places.  ARNETT: The antiaircraft weapons in the city center where we are living around the government buildings, erupted in fire. There must have been 200 guns firing to the sky. We did not see any aircraft around, but we did hear the alarm sirens. About two minutes after that, there were loud explosions, obviously bombing in at least three parts of the outskirts of the city.  We have no idea what those targets were, but they were in the direction of the airport and some military barracks. And the bombing has not come in this far yet. The attack did begin about 02:30 a.m. our time. Now here in the hotel, the Al Rasheed Hotel where we are. There was some indication earlier this evening, some of our colleagues received calls from friends who said tonight, maybe the night will be --  FRENCH: Peter? ARNETT: -- for the multinational force to begin its strike. FRENCH: Peter Arnett? ARNETT: -- and strike against Iraq and tonight it has come, John? HOLLIMAN: That's right, Peter. I think it would be good for those of us in Baghdad to turn off our microphone for just a moment. We have our CNN colleagues, of course, all over the world. Perhaps David French may be able to tell us as much about what they know about this potential attack as we can tell looking out our window. FRENCH: John, I think you might have thrown it to me. I couldn't tell. But if you did, we have a radio pool report in from John Bascom (ph). He's reporting that a squadron of F-15 fighter bombers has taken off from a base in central Saudi Arabia. The fighters, designed for long range bombing at night, were completely loaded with bombs, according to this report, with missiles and with 20-millimeter guns.  ARNETT: I was looking out the window earlier, John, and --  HOLLIMAN: Oh, Peter, look over here.  ARNETT: There is a sky is lighting up, I guess, to the south with antiaircraft fire, some as bright red, other as flashes of yellow light. What seems clear is that city is well defended with antiaircraft fire, and we can only presume that because they have started up again with considerable rapidity, that there is another attack coming in.  HOLLIMAN: We just heard whoa, holy cow. That was a large airburst that we saw. It was filling the sky. It's a --  ARNETT: And I think, John, that airburst took out the telecommunications. Now you may hear the bombs now. If you're still with us, you're going to hear the bombs now. They are hitting the center of this city.  We're crouched behind a window here. We're about 3 miles from where the center of action at this point seems to be.  HOLLIMAN: It's good to have a colleague like Peter Arnett to help out, I'll tell you that. My experience at being under attack is very limited, I'm proud to say. But I think by the time the sun comes up tomorrow, my experience will be much improved in this regard. We have a CNN Cameraman, Mark Biello, by the way, is taking pictures of this. And as soon as we're able to establish a video link to you, which we're sure won't be anytime soon, but will be hours from now, we'll be able to show you the pictures that we're talking about right now.  FRENCH: John and Peter, we're going to the White House for just a minute. Presidential Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater is about to address the nation and therefore the world.  MARLIN FITZWATER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I have a statement by the President of the United States. Deliberation of Kuwait has begun. In conjunction with the forces of our coalition partners, the United States has moved under the code name, Operation Desert Storm to enforce the mandates of the United Nations Security Council.  As of 07:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Operation Desert Storm forces were engaging targets in Kuwait and Iraq. President Bush will address the nation at 09:00 p.m. tonight from the Oval Office. I'll try to get you more as soon as we can. Thank you very much, everyone.  HOLLIMAN: OK, Peter, we're back.  ARNETT: I think what is most interesting to me, John, is that these bombs seem right on target. During the Vietnam War, there was a major problem with bombing targets in North Vietnam. Many bridges survived for years. Tonight, every bomb we have seen land seemed to have hit something. It -- they have these laser directed the guided bomb systems now which seem to be proving effective here tonight.  We've been waiting for this to happen since the deadline on the U.N. ultimatum passed at 08:00 yesterday morning in Baghdad and certainly is the day progressed. It was clear here that the authorities seemed to be preparing for some kind of action. I'm sure they didn't have any kind of advanced word. But as I speak to you the anti-aircraft fire has started up again and there is another wave of planes presumably coming in. We have yet to see the bombs fall but it's the same pattern of the previous at least three rays that we have witnessed.  SHAW: Wherever you are following CNN's coverage of this, our colleagues in Washington and our colleagues in Saudi Arabia obviously know a lot more than we know but we are on the receiving end of it. I just want to add one thing to everybody that we are safe, relatively speaking Peter and there is no sense of an immediate threat to our lives. Do you concur with that?  ARNETT: I would concur with that. I think we're safe enough here for the time being. Within a minute we can get to a shelter downstairs.  SHAW: John, it occurs to me that this attack is going to just shake the psyches of the Baghdadis here. This is unprecedented and I'm really anxious for daybreak to come so that we can get out and see what has been wrought here.  HOLLIMAN: Right, daybreak is only 4 hours away and if we make it that long we'll certainly be able to do that.  FRENCH: Richard Blystone is standing by in Jerusalem.  RICHARD BLYSTONE, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: The streets are unnaturally quiet. The Israeli government, of course, does know about it. The Prime Minister says he has been informed. The military will be making a statement very soon. The radio here now is broadcasting CNN live. The Foreign Ministry also is watching CNN. A lot of people now are getting their news from CNN.  HOLLIMAN: Something has changed, David. All the lights in the city of Baghdad are now out, from everything we can tell. My colleague Bernard Shaw is with me as we look out on this now dark city. It's absolutely pitch black.  SHAW: We are confined to the hotel. We can give this report tonight because we're on the 9th floor of the Al Rasheed Hotel, which has a commanding view of this very flat city to the north, south, east, and west. And for about the last two hours, there has been enormous activity, and now we hear planes actually going over here.  HOLLIMAN: Yeah, well, I'll see if I can see anything. All right. There's a plane nearby. Bernie, you can see something, right?  SHAW: All right. It's broken out on either side of us here at the hotel. And I'm just going to be quiet and let you listen.  HOLLIMAN: This is the heaviest raid so far, so close in. Maybe the outskirts have been pounded this way, but certainly several planes came right over the hotel and hit targets within a mile and a half of us. Bernie, what do you see on the other side of the hotel?  SHAW: Hey, I just come back from the other side. I'm really wearing out trousers here, crawling on my knees and hands. But, gentlemen, does it occur to you that it is not accidental that we are still reporting to the world?  HOLLIMAN: This government has told us frequently, including the Information Minister last night, that he wanted the press to stay here. In fact, he expressed anger that some of the press had left. He said, the International Press says it covers human rights. It should be here to see what the United States, the multinational force, is going to do. Now, I don't see any government officials around here tonight to assist us. But they have said that we can work here. And up to now this has to be unique that we are continuing to cover this story to talk to you, despite a series of major impact bombing raids. Well, I'm anxious for daylight to come. Maybe we can get some visibility.  Peter, look at this. This is a bright flash of light that seems to be it came across from north to south and even came up here bias in the hotel. And there it goes out of -- almost like a shooting star.  ARNETT: I think that shooting star is probably an S-15, John?  HOLLIMAN: Yeah.  FRENCH: We have temporarily lost contact with Baghdad. I don't wish to alarm anyone. We did expect to have this come in and out, but our three correspondents, Bernard Shaw, Peter Arnett and John Holliman are there in the Al Rasheed Hotel. We expect to and we hope to be bringing you some more of their reports later.  I'm pleased to report that we can go back to Baghdad now. And our three correspondents there, let's see who picks up the phone.  SHAW: Just to explain to our viewers why you did not hear from us for a nervously long time. For the past 20 minutes, I've been hiding under a table. And what happened was the security people made a sweep. They got very upset that there were three mortals on this floor as just three men standing in a hotel room. So I scampered to hide to make sure that if they pulled Arnett and Holliman out and took them downstairs into custody, at least there would still be one CNN person on the air. John? HOLLIMAN: I did the same thing you did, Bernie. Only I hid under a bed. And it's amazing that somebody's large as I am can get under a bed that close to the ground. But I was able to do it at least. And these security fellows also took some of the videotape out of one of our cameras. They say we'll get it back tomorrow. I'm a little skeptical that we will, but it was the beautiful pictures that we took to go along with the commentary that you heard earlier tonight on CNN.  SHAW: You keep using that word beautiful. This is not beautiful to me.  GEORGE H.W. BUSH, PRESIDENT: Just two hours ago, allied air forces began an attack on military targets in Iraq and Kuwait. These attacks continue as I speak. Ground forces are not engaged. Tonight, 28 nations, countries from five continents, Europe and Asia, Africa and the Arab League have forces in the Gulf area standing shoulder to shoulder against Saddam Hussein.  These countries had hoped the use of force could be avoided. Regrettably, we now believe that only force will make him leave. I've told the American people before that this will not be another Vietnam. And I repeat this here tonight, our troops will have the best possible support in the entire world. And they will not be asked to fight with one hand tied behind their back. We have no argument with the people of Iraq.  Indeed, for the innocents caught in this conflict, I pray for their safety. Our goal is not the conquest of Iraq. It is the liberation of Kuwait.  ARNETT: This is Peter Arnett in Baghdad, Iraq, 17 hours after the bombing.  So for John Holliman and Bernie Shaw and myself, Peter Arnett here is signing off from Baghdad for CNN and I hope we can resume our communication with you in the very near future.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The best reporting that I've seen on What Transpired in Baghdad was on CNN. END230516

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Hope it's shaping up to be a terrific Tuesday. Let's make this teacher time Tuesday, shall we? Shout out to all the educators out there uplifting, informing, and inspiring students. Go on and dap up your teacher. Give a handshake or high five. Let them know you appreciate all they do.  All right, lots to get to today, but only 10 minutes to do it, so let's get to it. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start with the end of Title 42.  Last week, we told you about the looming expiration of Title 42, the policy set by the Trump administration at the start of the COVID pandemic, allowing migrants to be quickly expelled at the U.S. Southern border without a chance to ask for asylum. The policy expired last Thursday night, along with the national coronavirus public health emergency.  With this expiration, there were major concerns about a massive surge of migrants at the border. But according to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the number of migrants at the U.S. Southern border is, "markedly down" over what they were prior to the end of Title 42.  Now, even though the number of people coming in may be lower than what federal officials were bracing for, communities at the southern border, well, they're still on high alert. Ed Lavandera has more.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  After Title 42 ended late Thursday night, some migrants discovered they didn't make it in time.  This father and son from Venezuela were turned away, but he says the goal is to get to the other side to find a way to reach the United States. But we'll have to wait and figure it out.  ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  We've been very, very clear that there are lawful, safe and orderly pathways to seek relief in the United States. And if one arrives at our southern border, one is going to face tougher consequences.  LAVANDERA:  In the days leading up to last night's deadline, border officials saw a surge of migrants. More than 23,000 are now in CBP custody, down slightly from earlier this week. But the end of Title 42 did not trigger the historic wave of migrants rushing to cross the border Friday that was predicted. In El Paso, thousands were waiting to be processed outside a border gate.  CHIEF RAUL ORTIZ, U.S. BORDER PATROL:  We're prioritizing those most vulnerable populations. We're doing this as quickly and as efficiently and as safely as we possibly can.  LAVANDERA:  That number now down to a couple hundred, says the city's mayor.  MAYOR OSCAR LEESER, EL PASO, TEXAS:  After yesterday's spike at about 1800 that came in yesterday, we've not seen any additional big numbers come in through the El Paso sector.  JOHN MARTIN, EL PASO, TEXAS:  We had lean-tos or tents, whatever term you want to use, literally all along the wall.  LAVANDERA:  John Martin runs a network of shelters in El Paso and said the crowds have dramatically dwindled in recent days.  MARTIN:  As of about 11:00 o'clock this morning, we had no new arrivals.  LAVANDERA:  While he was surprised at the lack of influx the morning after Title 42 lifted, he doesn't expect it will stay this way.  MARTIN:  I have to admit it's nice to be able to breathe one more time, but we can't let our guard down because we still know it's coming.  LAVANDERA (on camera):  In January U.S. Customs and Border Protection opened this massive tent processing facility in the El Paso area, about 20 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. It's designed to be able to hold about 1000 migrants at a time. And as you can see, construction crews are working to expand. And we're told by CBP officials in June they'll have room for another 1000 migrants to hold at this facility.  (Voice-over):  In Brownsville, dozens of buses line up near an intake facility, but a major humanitarian group in the area tells CNN they only had one bus of migrants arrive today. About 155,000 migrants were estimated to be in shelters and on streets in Mexico waiting to enter the U.S. A source familiar with federal estimates said migrants will still risk their lives to make it to the U.S. And from now on, people who cross the border illegally will face a tougher path to requesting asylum. Many will be deported, like this group who were shackled and led onto a repatriation flight, like this one, leaving for Guatemala on Thursday.  (On camera):  In the days leading up to the end of Title 42, this alleyway, be kind of migrant shelter in El Paso was packed with migrants sleeping outside. All of that has changed. And what several migrant advocates tell us is that for now, they think that migrants on the Mexican side of the border are reassessing the border landscape, trying to figure out when the next best opportunity might be to cross into the U.S. Ed Lavandera, CNN, El Paso, Texas.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today we are going to spotlight an inspiring young woman named Yasmine Arrington who knows firsthand the challenges of growing up while having a parent who's incarcerated. Gaining strength through her struggles, Yasmine started a nonprofit group called ScholarCHIPS. CHIPS is an acronym standing for Children of Incarcerated Parents. The organization provides scholarships, mentoring, and a network of support. Meet our CNN hero, Yasmine Arrington.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) YASMINE ARRINGTON:  My father has been in and out of jail, in prison my entire life. My father's incarceration has certainly affected me on a personal level, emotionally, mentally. Many young people who have incarcerated parents definitely feel stigmatized and marginalized.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you looking at me? What are you looking at? Probably or some cookies.  ARRINGTON:  I was 13 years old when my mother passed away. I was raised by my maternal grandmother. And my grandmother is a big advocate of education. She knew that college was coming down the pike for me, but, you know, there was no college fund.  My grandmother began researching various scholarships online that I would be eligible for. She said, I don't see any for young people like yourself who have incarcerated parents. And I kept that in my mind. When I was a junior, I went through a social entrepreneurship program for teenagers, and we had to come up with a social venture. So I pitched ScholarCHIPS. And the CHIPS, of course, is an imperfect acronym for Children of Incarcerated Parents.  And the judges, they love the idea. And so here I was, 16 years old, with $1,000 seed grant. I wasn't even old enough to have a bank account.  ScholarCHIPS is a nonprofit organization that provides college scholarships, mentoring, mental health supports, and a robust support network to college bound young adults who have incarcerated parents. The main objective is to help directly address the financial gap and challenges that many of our scholars face.  Our scholars are provided with brand new laptops. We also have an emergency fund. And so when scholars have unexpected challenges that come up, we definitely step in to help.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hi.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Hello, there. How are we doing?  ARRINGTON:  Our scholars have the option to opt in to being matched with a mentor who wants to be a cheerleader and a champion. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I mean, let's remember this journey, right? Just lean into it and let it just wash over. This is really good stuff.  ARRINGTON:  They have someone who has already been through college and the process that they're currently going through.  Tiana (ph), hi.  I do personally check in with our scholars. Getting ready for graduation? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yeah. ARRINGTON: I  know, congratulations. I'm so excited.  The checkings are very helpful because oftentimes we will discover a need that a scholar has that we otherwise didn't know.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  A judgy traffic light that only lets you pass if you're driving, right? Well, that's today's story getting a 10 out of 10. This traffic light is watching you, monitoring your speed as you're passing through. If you're under the limit, ding, ding, ding. Good job. Keep going. You can get your green. But you'll feel the shame if you drive too fast. A red light, you shall not pass. This is all part of an experiment in Canada, in a suburb of Montreal. The light is also gathering information regarding traffic flow and driver behavior and then relays this information to the city for analysis. In addition to making people ponder poor life choices by forcing them to slow down and stop at a red light. Now that's breaking news.  Today's specials out is going to Piedmont, South Carolina, Wren Middle School, you rock. Thank you for everyone who's subscribed and have been commenting on our CNN 10 YouTube Channel. Much love, right back at you. Make it an awesome day, everybody. I'll see you tomorrow. I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10. END230517

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, and it is your CNN 10, especially on a #yourwordwednesday. Follow me @coywire on Insta, Snapchat and TikTok, and put your unique vocabulary word in the comment section of my most recent post. And we'll choose a winner to work into tomorrow's show. Let's go.  We start today with the latest negotiations on the debt ceiling. Last week, we told you the debt ceiling is the limit. The total amount of money the U.S. government is authorized to borrow to meet its legal obligations. It's currently more than $31 trillion. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reiterated that the government could run out of money to pay its bills by June 1 if Congress doesn't raise the debt limit soon. With time running out to strike a debt limit deal, President Biden and congressional leaders met yesterday for a pivotal face to face meeting at the White House. President Biden says that raising the limit is a responsibility of Congress, and most Democrats argue that the debt limit should be raised without any sort of conditions in order to avoid an economic disaster. Most Republicans, though, well, they don't want to raise that debt ceiling anymore until federal spending cuts are part of the deal. Over the weekend, the White House was cautiously optimistic about a potential agreement between the two sides, but House Speaker Kevin McCarthy continued to express doubts on Monday. Our Manu Raju is on Capitol Hill with more.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Speaker Kevin McCarthy had been pessimistic as talks have occurred on the staff level for the past week to try to avoid the nation's first ever debt default. McCarthy has been calling for talks for some time. The White House has resisted calling for the national debt limit, which is more than $31 trillion, to be raised without any conditions, whatsoever, to avoid the prospects of the United States not being able to pay its bills. McCarthy has rejected that approach, called for spending cuts to be attached with raising the national borrowing limit. The House did pass a bill to do just that, included a host of Republican priorities. The Democrats and the White House say that is dead on arrival. So where does it go? There is not much time left in order to get a deal by that potential June 1 deadline to avoid this default. McCarthy made clear that there is a long way to go. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R) HOUSE SPEAKER:  I appreciate the President finally willing to talk after 97 days, but there is no movement. We're only a couple of weeks away, and if you look at the timeline, to pass something in the House and pass something in the Senate, you've got to have something done by this weekend and we are nowhere near any of that. RAJU:  Now, even if they were to get some sort of deal, it will take some time in order to put it on paper, in order to draft it into legislative text, in order to go through the House and the Senate. All that takes a significant amount of time, which is raising a lot of concerns about whether or not they will actually be able to get there. As debt default looms over Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia.  What 1940s character symbolized women joining the U.S. workforce?  Susan B. Anthony, Rosie the Riveter, Betsy Ross, or Sally Ride? Rosie the Riveter was used to encourage women to join the workforce during World War II.  Decades after Rosie the Riveter became a symbolic icon for working women in World War II, Ukrainian women are bravely stepping up. Ukrainian men and while they're being forced to leave their jobs because of mandatory military service, to fight in a war against Russia. As the war continues on, Ukrainian officials say their capital city of Kyiv was hit by a, "exceptional attack" early Tuesday, but their air defenses destroyed most of the missiles and drones lost by Russia. With many important and sometimes dangerous jobs being vacated while men fight in the war, Ukrainian women are rallying to keep things running. Our Nic Robertson is in Ukraine with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  War is changing everything. Tetiana is at the vanguard, shattering Ukrainian coal mining history. A woman on her way to work 1000 feet underground.  (On camera):  It's normal. It's OK now?  TETIANA, COAL MINER:  Yes.  ROBERTSON:  Yes, it's good. Is it good? You like it, huh?  TETIANA:  Yes, I wanted it.  ROBERTSON:  You wanted to be miner? TETIANA:  Yes, yeah. ROBERTSON:  Yeah. Your family, your grandfather, your father was minor? TETIANA:  Yes. ROBERTSON:  Yeah, yeah. (Voice-over):  She used to work above ground. But when miners got called up to fight and martial law cleared women for dangerous jobs, she jumped at a job deep in the mine. TETIANA (through translator):  I always wanted to work here. But girls were not allowed. When many men were conscripted, the mine had to keep working. So to protect our country, the girl stepped up.  ROBERTSON:  She wants to keep her underground job when the war is over. But that may not be so easy, yet even Chief Engineer Alexander admits without Tetiana and many other women, the mine could not have kept going. (On camera):  There hasn't been a general mobilization of women, but plenty of traditional male only workplaces are finding women, stepping up and taking jobs that before the war would have only gone to men.  (Voice-over):  Maria is among them. For the love of Ukraine and of her husband. She took up his blacksmith job when he got called up to fight last year. They bought the forge together a few years earlier, invested their future in it.  MARIA KOBETS, BLACKSMITH, KOBETS FORGE (through translator):  This is my husband's passion and his life's business. I decided to support him, to keep his job alive while he is serving.  ROBERTSON:  She shows me a video of husband Andre working at the same anvil prewar his artwork, some Game of Thrones themed selling in the U.S. and Europe for hundreds of dollars. KOBETS (through translator):  I often cry in the forge here. My husband is defending us and that is very dangerous. But this work helps me to hold on and not fall apart.  ROBERTSON:  Women have been here before. Remember Rosie the Riveter, icon of women at work in World War II? She and others cracked the glass ceiling. More than a hint of Rosie in Maria and perhaps of changes here too. Maria, Tetiana, two of many who bravely stepped up. No doubt more challenges ahead. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Now, for those of you who saw my social media posts on Monday and asked for us to do a story on it, you got it. Dwayne Johnson, aka, The Rock and Dany Garcia, they're today's story, getting a 10 out of 10. I was in San Antonio working on a project soon to come and ahead of the XFL co-owner celebrating the championship win for the Renegades, I asked DJ and Dany a question specifically for all of you.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  What is the key to persevering through tough times? DANY GARCIA, BUSINESSWOMAN, FILM PRODUCER AND BODYBUILDER:  There's faith, right? Faith, higher power faith. But there's also faith that lives in who you are. Maybe at that moment you may not think, you know, me feeling good about myself or my opinion of myself is the most important opinion. But in the long run, your opinion of who you are matters. You are what's most important. You matter to you. And whatever tough time is happening, time will make it better. Reaching out to people you love will making better, but loving yourself will make it better. DWAYNE JOHNSON, ACTOR, FILM PRODUCER AND FORMER WRESTLER:  Beautiful answer, I think Coy, for the kids who are watching this in their classroom right now, you got to have that faith that things are going to get better. It's much easier for us to sit and say it than it is to do it because that's always the case. But I've been there. You've been there, we've been there. I've been in some tough times, man. In my high school days where I used to think, I don't know if this, if I could get through this, I don't know how I'm going to do it. But keeping the faith and also I think it's really important for kids today if you're going through it and you're going through some tough times, talk to some somebody that's important because I know how it was for me growing up as a kid. It wasn't -- talking about my feelings, was not cool.  So I kept it all in here and that's not cool. We like to tell kids is if you're going through it, talk to somebody, get it out. Somebody out there is going to help you. And just keep in mind that when you talk to somebody, even if it feels funky or uncomfortable, you talk to somebody. That's your superpower. It's talking to somebody.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Powerful stuff from DJ and Dany Garcia. And when you realize their successes in life are probably a direct result of their positive attitudes, it kind of makes you want to have one yourself.  Tag them in my most recent Instagram post @Danygarciaco, @therock. Let them feel the CNN 10 love.  Now, speaking of The Rock, our special shout out today goes to Eek, Alaska. Eek School, you rock. Remember, it's a great day to be a cougar. Shine bright today, everyone. You never know when, you never know how or for whom, but you are going to be the light that someone needs one day.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, friends. Happy Friday Eve. It's Thursday, May 18. Let's keep it going strong. We're almost at the end of the week. And let's make this a random thought Thursday, shall we? What word actually becomes shorter when you add two letters to it?  Now, if you know the answer, keep it to yourself. If not, think about it. Ruminate and debate, and I'll give you the answer at the end of the show. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we begin overseas where we're seeing heavy flooding in Italy.  Officials say at least five people have been killed and over 5000 residents have been forced to be evacuated from their homes after extreme flooding and mudslides hit the northern Italian region of Emilia-Romagna.  This region actually was suffering a prolonged drought, but it's under red alert, meaning it's the highest-level warning or state of emergency for life threatening weather events. The situation is getting dire as more rain is expected. A total of 600 firefighters have been deployed from all over the country to assist with evacuation efforts in the region after one of its rivers burst its banks. Officials, they're advising residents there to take the utmost caution.  Formula One has even announced the cancellation of this weekend's Grand Prix event there because of heavy flooding in the region. Citing safety concerns. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni tweeted on Tuesday evening, extending her total sympathy to those affected by the flooding, adding that the government stands, "ready to intervene with the necessary aid." CNN's Barbie Latza Nadeau has more for us from Italy.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Roads turn to rivers as rain many hoped would alleviate drought conditions. Now a serious threat in the central Italian region of Emilia-Romagna. There are already victims. And rescuers are searching for the missing. Hundreds of people were rescued from flooded homes, many brought to safety and rubber dinghies on flooded streets. More than 5000 people are under evacuation, according to the civil protection, the region had been undergoing severe drought.  In 2022, low rainfall and extreme heat depleted the river Po a crucial waterway for transport and irrigation. A winter with very little snow did little to help. And as bad as these floods are, they are only a drop in the bucket for what is needed to reverse the drought. Earlier this month, a downpour swelled the Po by 5 feet. This deluge of water will raise it even more, but it is still well below average.  Extreme weather events are threatening other Italian regions from Venice, where the MOSE floodgates have been raised to protect the city from high water, to Sicily, where heavy storms down trees and flooded homes. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Rome.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia.  Charles Darwin's theory of evolution was inspired by a trip to what group of islands?  Hawaiian Islands, British Isles, Galapagos Islands or the Florida Keys? An Ecuadorian archipelago, the Galapagos Islands inspired the theory of evolution following Darwin's trip there in 1835.  The Galapagos Islands are known for their rich biodiversity and stunning wildlife with endangered species. But many of the species on the islands are now in need of protection. Our Lynda Kinkade reports on how Ecuador has started a new program called Debt-For-Nature to help fund conservation efforts.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LYNDA KINKADE, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Darwin's flycatcher, a creature that helped inspire Darwin's theory on evolution 188 years ago, sits perched on the edge of extinction. The small bird species native to Ecuador's Galapagos Island chain is dwindling in number.  On the island of Santa Cruz, just 15 adult pears remain. Yet scientists see a glimmer of hope in the past year, 12 new chicks were hatched, a sign that the species will live on to fight another day.  For now, this tiny comeback is helping to spur efforts to protect the rich biodiversity of the Galapagos Islands. These islands are at a perilous crossroads. According to researchers, a million plants and animals worldwide are at risk of extinction from habitat destruction, rising carbon emissions and overfishing.  As biodiversity declines worldwide, the Galapagos Islands are a litmus test. To protect this precious ecosystem, Ecuador announced a record setting deal to convert $1.6 billion of its debt into a loan it says would channel at least $12 million a year to conserving the Galapagos.  JOSE ANTONIO DAVALOS, ECUADORIAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTER (through translator): Not only will it allow us to protect 2500 marine species, of which 38 are migratory, but it will also allow us to move towards a sustainable fishery.  KINKADE: It is one of the largest debt for conservation swaps in history. Over the next two decades, Ecuador hopes to channel over $450 million towards protecting one of the most incredible ecosystems on the planet, a move that some say is crucial not just for the environment, but for Ecuador's survival.  ELIZABETH SALINAS, TRADER (through translator): It seems to me that we must help maintain the flora and fauna and thus attract tourism, which is what keeps the country alive.  KINKADE: In late 2022, nearly 190 nations signed on to take measures to combat biodiversity loss, passing a U.N. agreement that pledges to preserve 30% of the world's land and seas by 2030. Ambitious measures that conservation groups say do not go far enough.  Meanwhile, some environmentalists hope Ecuador's debt for conservation model gains momentum in other parts of the world as a win-win for both economies and for conservation efforts. Lynda Kinkade, CNN.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Now, this next story is going to make you think twice the next time you see a plant. Did you know that plants actually make sounds that are undetectable to the human ear? That's right. And according to a new study, our seemingly silent green friends actually make noises when they're thirsty or when they're under some kind of stress. Where do you hear this?  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Those everyday house plants sitting on your windowsill are more like us than we thought. New research shows they even get stressed and are vocal about it. Listen to this. These popping sounds come from a stressed tomato plant. To record this, scientists use ultrasonic microphones that detect frequencies human ears can't. The audio is then sped up and edited so we can hear it. Researchers are unsure why plants make these sounds, but we do know that plants can detect certain sounds as well.  RICHARD KARBAN, ENTOMOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS: Plants have been reported to respond to the sounds of bees, to produce sweeter nectar, and also chewing sounds of caterpillars feeding on their leaves.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For example, watch this mustard plant react to a cabbage caterpillar chewing on its leaves by releasing an internal wave of calcium.  KARBAN: Some of these electrical responses are not too dissimilar to the electrical responses that occur in nerve cells of animals.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Plants then become more resistant or less preferred by insects. Scientists say that these defenses are passed down to plants offspring through their seeds. And it's not just their progeny. Plants can even recognize and help other family members.  KARBAN: We don't know how this works, but when plants encounter the roots of their relatives as opposed to the roots of strangers, they have been found to grow less and as a result, to compete less for resources like water and soil nutrients.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All of these abilities are tied to plants fight for survival. But contrary to what some plant lovers may think, a plant survival doesn't appear to be affected by talking to or playing it music.  KARBAN: My guess is that if you care enough to talk to your plant, you're probably paying attention to how it's doing, what kinds of conditions it's experiencing. And that's probably a good thing.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Now, if you don't have any qualms about walking past storm drains along the sidewalk, this next story getting a 10 out of 10 might make you think twice. A mysterious creature is lurking in the pipes underground, seen by stormwater crews in Oviedo, Florida, with a robotic camera. At first they think it's a salamander or a frog, but then, that's a gator, dude. And we're talking about a five-foot-long gator. The robot could only follow the prehistoric looking beast for about 340 feet before the bot got stuck, and it was see you later, alligator. Wonder where that thing is.  All right. So many great Your Word Wednesday submissions yesterday. And the winner is Mary from St. Isidore School in Quakertown, Pennsylvania for qualm, a noun that's an uneasy feeling of doubt, worry or fear, especially about one's own conduct. Well done.  And as for that random thought Thursday, what word actually becomes shorter when you add two letters to it? The word is short it becomes shorter when you add two letters.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, my friends. We made it to the end of the week. It's Friday, and Friday's rock, and so do all of you. Remember, what's within influences, what happens without. So let's get our minds right and finish this week strong.  We start on Capitol Hill, where congressional leaders are deeply concerned with the risks of artificial intelligence, or AI. Now, with some background, we've all heard how the impact of AI can change our daily lives, where it can even impact how we work within many industries, impacting jobs across the globe.  The tech company OpenAI has been at the center of all of this, especially after the wild success of ChatGPT, the company's Chatbot tool, where it can learn to mimic the grammar and structure of our writing and speech.  This tool has now led to other tech companies building their own programs and apps to create arts, pictures, images, as well as impersonating other people's voices. Major tech leaders have been questioned about the risks of AI, including Twitter CEO Elon Musk. And statements like this from a CNBC interview are raising a few eyebrows.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA, SPACEX AND TWITTER: There's a strong probability that it will make life much better and that we'll have an age of abundance and there's some chance that it goes wrong and destroys humanity. Hopefully, that chance is small, but it's not zero. And so I think we want to take whatever actions we can think of to minimize the probability that AI goes wrong.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE: Now, earlier this week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He faced serious questions about how his program and other major tech intelligence apps can pose a threat to humanity and possibly put us all out of work. Altman, however, did urge lawmakers to regulate artificial intelligence, describing the technology's current boom as potential printing press moment, as he described it, but it's a moment that he says requires safeguards.  Also in his remarks, the OpenAI CEO says the potential for AI to be used to manipulate voters and target disinformation are among his areas of greatest concern, especially because there's going to be a presidential election next year. And he says these models are getting better. CNN's Nick Watt has more for us from the hearing.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM ALTMAN, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, OPEN AI: My worst fears are that we cause significant, we, the field, the technology, the industry cause significant harm to the world.  NICK WATT, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Today's Senate hearing is a crucial step in humanity's effort to prevent that harm and to rein in the handful of players controlling this tech.  ALTMAN: So I think there needs to be incredible scrutiny on us and our competitors.  WATT: His company created ChatGPT. You know, it can write a term paper or a song, captured imaginations and headlines.  BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR: Could artificial intelligence soon put us all out of work? WATT: AI has potentially world changing benefits equitable education, helping eradicate disease, transportation. AI can be life enhancing or maybe an existential threat to humanity.  GARY MARCUS, PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AND NEURAL SCINCE, NYU: These new systems are going to be destabilizing. They can and will create persuasive lies at a scale humanity has never seen before. Democracy itself is threatened. WATT: As are jobs. ALTMAN: GPT4 will, I think entirely, automate away some jobs, and it will create new ones that we believe will be much better.  WATT: There are risks, like automated weapons we can imagine.  SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA: Could AI create a situation where a drone can select the target itself?  ALTMAN: I think we shouldn't allow that.  GRAHAM: Well, can it be done?  ALTMAN: Sure.  WATT: And there are risks we can, for now, barely even comprehend. ALTMAN: As these systems do become more capable, and I'm not sure how far away that is, but maybe not super far. I think it's important that we also spend time talking about how we're going to confront those challenges.  WATT: So, what do we do?  SEN. JOHN NEELY KENNEDY, (R) LOUISIANA: Talk in plain English and tell me what, if any, rules we ought to implement.  MARCUS: Number one, a safety review like we use with the FDA prior to widespread deployment.  WATT: Suggestions today to licensed developers and/or the most powerful AI systems.  ALTMAN: I think a model that can persuade, manipulate, influence person's behavior or person's belief. That would be a good threshold. I think a model that could help create novel biological agents would be a great threshold.  WATT: There was support in this room for a brand-new government agency to oversee AI. But --  SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D) CONNECTICUT: For every success story in government regulation, you can think of five failures.  WATT: And this technology is moving very, very fast. Google, Microsoft and others pouring in billions of dollars. Government can be glacial.  SEN. RICHARD DURBIN, (D) ILLINOIS: When you look at the record of Congress and dealing with innovation, technology and rapid change, we're not designed for that.  SEN. PETER WELCH, (D) VERMONT: I've come to the conclusion that it's impossible for Congress to keep up with the speed of technology.  WATT: There is, of course, an election in the U.S. just about 18 months away, and an avalanche of misinformation no doubt on its way. So there's not much time to deal with at least some of the issues at play here.  Another big question, should the U.S. just create its own agency and then hope that the rest of the world will follow? Or should people be concentrating on creating a global initiative, a global body to oversee AI?  Now, listen, three minutes on Capitol Hill or three minutes on television is not nearly enough to deal with this massive topic. That committee of the Senate will be meeting many more times. Many brains around the world working on this problem, and experts tell me that we, you, me, all of us, we need to also educate ourselves about AI so we know what's coming down the pike and how it might impact us. Nick Watt, CNN Los Angeles.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Ten second trivia.  In 1889, the U.S. Government opened two million acres for settlement in a region that became what state?  California, Texas, Oklahoma, or Wyoming?  Those who entered before the official start time were dubbed sooners, which is why Oklahoma is named the Sooner state.  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin, adding another incredible chapter to his recovery as he was honored with the George Hollis award by the pro-football writers of America on Monday.  Given each year to the NFL player, coach, or staff member that overcame adversity to succeed, Hamlin was cleared to resume football activities last month after suffering cardiac arrest on the playing field in January.  Now Danny Kellington, the Bills Assistant Athletic Trainer who helped save Hamlin's life, gave a powerful commencement speech at his alma mater, Oklahoma State over the weekend, telling graduates that preparation is one of life's keys to success.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANNY KELLINGTON, BUFFALO BILLS ASSISTANT ATHLETIC TRAINER: Thankfully, we restored Damar's heartbeat. We were ready. It's a bit odd to be the person reporters are talking about when they say, Danny Kellington is a hero. It's very humbly. I've said repeatedly that I am not a hero. But I will tell you what I was that day. I was ready. When unexpected doors open or life changes course, trust that your experiences have led you there, and you will be ready.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE: Wise words, Mr. Kellington. You don't have to get ready if you stay ready. There's no such thing as luck when it comes to true success, right? Most often, true success is discipline and preparation meeting a moment. Special shout out is going to Beverly Middle School in Beverly, Massachusetts, rise up.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello to you and happy Monday to all my friends all across the country. Hope you had a great weekend.  I was in Ocean City, Maryland, with my dad and brother for the annual car show there. Hot rods, muscle cars, cruisers, all sorts of awesome rides and people. To Bryant, Nathaniel, Journey and Jada (ph) from Cape Henlopen High School in Milford, and Mariner Middle Schools, it was great to meet you. Now this is going to be our last week together before the show goes on summer hiatus, so what do you say we get our engine started and go all gas, no brakes and finish this school year strong. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10.  And we begin today with the G7 Summit or the Group of Seven summit. It's where the world's most powerful democracies meet to discuss a wide range of issues, including economic policies, security, the climate, and energy issues.  The G7 countries are the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Italy, Germany, France and Canada. But leaders from some non-G7 countries will also participate this year. Australia, Brazil, Comoros, Cook Islands, India, Indonesia, South Korea and Vietnam are also invited.  This year is Japan's turn to host, led by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. The summit is in the Japanese city of Hiroshima, which is where, as many of you know, the world's first atomic bomb attack happened at the end of World War II in the 1940s.  Hiroshima is the prime minister's hometown as well and the host city was chosen to emphasize a determination to put nuclear disarmament at the top of the agenda of this year's summit. Key issues being discussed this year include growing aggression from China and North Korea and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a surprise appearance at the summit to address his nation's ongoing conflict with Russia.  Now, while President Biden is at the summit, the debt ceiling limit is a growing concern back in the United States. The deadline to reach an agreement is just a matter of days away, and President Biden addressed a stark warning about the debt limit as both the White House and congressional Republicans remain at a standstill. Our Phil Mattingly is in Japan with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The second full day of President Biden's high-stakes appearance on the world stage clouded by one reality. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE SPEAKER:  We've got to get movement by the White House. And we don't have any movement yet.  MATTINGLY:  Even as he wakes up 7,000 miles away from Washington, Biden is no closer to resolving the looming crisis he left behind.  REP. GARRETT GRAVES (R-LA):  Until people are willing to have reasonable conversations about how you can actually move forward and do the right thing then we're not going to sit here and talk to ourselves. And that's what's going on. MATTINGLY:  House Republicans hitting pause on negotiations with the White House over a fiscal deal that would address the debt limit, less than two weeks before the U.S. is set to default for the first time in its history with potentially catastrophic consequences for the global economy. Biden leaving a working dinner of G7 leaders here in Hiroshima early on Thursday night to be briefed on the talks.  His second briefing of the day on negotiations that are in desperate need of a breakthrough. A White House official telling CNN, quote, there are real differences between the parties but that the president's team is working hard towards a reasonable bipartisan solution.  Biden's domestic political challenge coming at the same moment U.S. officials are pressing to maintain and accelerate the steadfast support for Ukraine. G7 leader is putting the conflict front and center in the first day of their summit in Japan, launching new sanctions and export curbs designed to squeeze Russia's ability to wage war, at the same time, Biden marking his own dramatic shift, delivering the message to his counterparts that the U.S. will support a joint effort with allies to train Ukrainian pilots on fourth generation fighter jets, including F-16s. Those fighter jets have been a top Ukrainian priority, as Russia's invasion of the country grinds towards its 15th month, at an inflection point with allies rapidly moving to provide new defense capabilities as Ukrainian forces prepare for a long-awaited counter-offensive. Those efforts set to receive a dramatic boost by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's last-minute decision to travel to the G7 leader summit this weekend. It's Zelenskyy's latest visit to rally's support after securing commitments for additional aid in European capitals last week, before a stop in Saudi Arabia where he addressed the Arab League Summit. And President Zelenskyy is expected to participate on Sunday in meetings with G7 leaders. President Biden is expected to be meeting on issues like climate, issues like infrastructure but a central focus or an overarching focus on the issue of China. Phil Mattingly, CNN, Hiroshima. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, a TikTok takedown. Montana has become the first U.S. state to sign a bill banning the download of the popular app due to privacy and security concerns.  TikTok says that more than million Americans are active users on their platform known for sharing short videos of anything from dance challenges, food recipes, inspiration, motivation, how-to tutorials, comedians and more. And for their part, TikTok maintains that all user information on their platform is safe. Our Brian Todd has more from Montana. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For the first time, a U.S. state has completely banned TikTok, sort of. Montana Governor Greg Gianforte signing a bill that bans downloading the app in Montana. Individuals who already have TikTok won't be prosecuted for using it, but App Stores like Apple or Google Play would be fine if they let anyone in Montana download it. The Montana ban will probably face strong challenges in court, but it's the latest salvo against the popular app that nearly half of Americans use for sharing short videos, of everything from goofy stunts, to food recipes and dance challenges. Critics call it a security threat because a Chinese company owns TikTok. REP. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS (R-WA):  To the American people watching today, hear this, TikTok is a weapon by the Chinese communist party to spy on you, manipulate what you see and exploit for future generations. TODD:  The most serious warnings, that personal data could be stolen, privacy compromised. JAMES LEWIS, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES:  That's the main concern is this Chinese software controlled by the Chinese state and you are downloading it onto -- voluntarily downloading it onto your phone.  TODD:  Critics say TikTok users could be spied on and blackmailed. One analyst says China could use the app to take a page out of Vladimir Putin's playbook and create misinformation campaigns to influence American politics. LEWIS:  Maybe downplay stories about what's going on in China, that they don't want people to see maybe exaggerate stories about how things aren't going so well in the U.S. TikTok's CEO recently told skeptical lawmakers the company doesn't share user data, doesn't spy for Beijing, and doesn't take orders on content.  SHOU CHEW, CEO, TIKTOK:  It is our commitment to this community and all our users that we will keep this free from any manipulation of any government. We will protect the U.S. user data and fire it all from all unwanted foreign access. RODGERS:  Your platform should be banned. TODD:  More than half of U.S. states and the federal government have already restricted the TikTok app from being installed on government devices. Defenders of the app say there's no evidence TikTok has spied on users at the Chinese government's behest or turned over data. And -- REP. JAMAAL BOWMAN (D-NY):  We're talking about free speech for everyday Americans. TODD:  And the Chinese government calls talk of a ban a xenophobic witch hunt. But analysts say if the Chinese regime does decide to pressure TikTok for information, by Chinese law, the company can't say no. PROF. AYNNE KOKAS, AUTHOR, "TRAFFICKING DATA: HOW CHINA IS WINNING":  Are there pressures from the Chinese government that eventually make their way down to TikTok? Absolutely. TODD:  In a statement to CNN, TikTok vowed to defend the rights of its users in Montana, saying the governor has signed a bill that infringes on the First Amendment rights of people in the state. TikTok calls the ban unlawful and says it wants to reassure Montanans that they can continue to use the platform to express themselves. Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.

Considered a wonder of the ancient world, the pyramids of Egypt are not on the list of new world wonders. (MUSIC) WIRE:  A Guinness World Record for visiting all Seven New Wonders of the World in less than seven days -- well, that's today's story getting a 10 out of 10. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Come on, a new Guinness World Record. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  With only a backpack, British traveler Jamie McDonald whose alter ego is "Adventureman" started his trek by walking parts of the Great Wall of China. He traveled to the Taj Mahal in India, the Petra in Jordan, Colosseum in Rome, then headed to South America to the Christ the Redeemer statue in Brazil, Machu Picchu in Peru, and finish it up at Chichen Itza in Mexico. Nine countries, four continents in less than a week, and he traveled the 22,000 some miles using only public transportation, 13 flights, 16 taxis, nine buses, four trains, and a toboggan.  Perhaps the most inspiring part -- when he was 9 years old, Jamie was diagnosed with a rare spine disorder and doctors thought he'd have trouble even walking for the rest of his life. W, Jamie. I want to give us a special shout out today to Mrs. Williams class at North Forsyth Middle School here in Georgia. We see you. Thanks for the love and thanks for watching, everyone.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, everyone. It's Tuesday, and it's our last teacher time Tuesday shout-out of the year. Much respect to all of you who are uplifting, informing and inspiring the next generation.  Students, go dap up your teachers. Give a handshake or a high five. Let them know you appreciate them. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. So grateful to be here with you. Let's start today with a quick zip through some of the headlines making the news.  First up, a devastating cyclone has rocked the Southeast Asian country of Myanmar. Cyclone Mocha, a category storm with winds of up to 195 miles per hour battered the nation, leaving entire villages wiped out, shelters destroyed and piles of debris stretching for miles, is considered one of the strongest storms to ever hit Myanmar and authorities say more than 400 people have died.  According to U.N.'s humanitarian office, clean water supplies and fuel are running low, and there is critical need for shelters, food medicine, and health care services. Thoughts and prayers for the people there. Next, we go to Europe where the European Union regulators have fined social media giant Meta a record-breaking $1.3 billion for transferring the personal data of Facebook's E.U users to servers in the U.S. Meta, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp said it would appeal the ruling including the fine, and it also says there would be no immediate disruption of the Facebook app in Europe. Meta says the root of this issue comes from a quote conflict of law between U.S. rules on access to data and the privacy rights of Europeans. Next up, we head to Florida where we had a successful rocket launch check out this SpaceX rocket taking off on Sunday as the crew embarks on a week-  long stay aboard the International Space Station. The Dragon freedom spacecraft crew is led by former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson who's now the first woman to command a private space flight. She's joined by three paying customers.  Stem cell researcher Rayyanah Barnawi is making history as the first woman from Saudi Arabia to ever travel to space. This marks the second all-  private mission to the International Space Station. Houston-based company Axiom Space is in charge of the journey called Ax-2. All right. Let's stay out of this world and head to the Red Planet or Mars. Back in the summer of 2020, NASA launched a space rover called Mars 2020 Perseverance. This small mobile robot eventually landed on Mars seven months later. The main goal of this mission was for the rover to look for signs of past microbial life, snag some rock and soil samples and best of all prepare for human exploration in the future. Remember, no human has ever been to Mars. Our Ashley Strickland sat down with a NASA scientist who gives us exciting updates on the mission, and the possible history of water on one of Mars's craters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ASHLEY STRICKLAND, CNN SPACE & SCIENCE WRITER: Where is Perseverance rover currently and what is it up to these days? KATIE STACK MORGAN, MARS 2020 DEPUTY PROJECT SCIENTIST, NASA JPL: So, Perseverance is still in Jezero Crater. It is on this fan that is in Jezero Crater, and we've now climbed up on top of this fan and are exploring the sedimentary rocks on the top surface of the fan. STRICKLAND: What can we hope to learn from this area. MORGAN: We have recorded different depositional environments that could be lake environments, delta environments, river environments, that really capture the history of water in Jezero Crater.  STRICKLAND: So what are some of the different types of rock that perseverance has encountered since it landed two years ago. MORGAN: We had a lot of debates early on before we landed, sedimentary or igneous formed by volcanoes or formed deposited by water or wind. And as it turned out, these were igneous rocks, which was of surprise to us, but a really pleasant surprise because igneous rocks contain different kinds of information that we're interested in for return sample science. And so we have things like volcanic salt, rocks that likely formed deep in the interior of Mars from magma. Then we transitioned from that crater floor into the sedimentary deposits and now we're here in sandstones, conglomerates, mud stones, the kinds of rocks that are deposited by flowing water. STRICKLAND: What could we hope to learn from this diverse array of samples when they come back to Earth? MORGAN: The fact that we have a diverse set of rocks means we have different types of potential habitable environments recorded within these rocks. Surface, watery environments we know from here on Earth is a good place to record signs of ancient life. But there's also the potential that life could find habitable niches in igneous rocks when water flows through those rocks underground. STRICKLAND: You've been wanting to get outside of the crater, so what does that look like? MORGAN: There are a lot of mysteries outside the crater. This is some of the oldest crust in the solar system, and we're going to have a chance to explore that with the rover. But this is a part of solar system history that's not well-preserved here on Earth. So we're going to get to see rocks of this age for the first time on Mars. It's unclear what these rocks are to look like. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Ten-second trivia: Name the island country off the coast of Africa whose capital is Port Louis? Mauritius, Seychelles, Madagascar or Gambia? Mauritius is your answer here. The island nation gained independence from the U.K. in 1968. Now, Mauritius is an island nation that's closely linked to its vast ebony forest. Historically, these durable black hardwood trees were used for building furniture, cabinets, even piano keys. But now, conservationists are doing reservation initiatives, looking to save the forest along with its exotic bird species. Our Zane Asher has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAIN ASHER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Some 12,000 miles of the southeastern coast of Africa in the middle of the Indian Ocean lies the island where the iconic dodo bird once roamed. Centuries after its extinction, the flightless bird is still inextricably linked with the African nation of Mauritius. You can find it on banknotes, coins and the country's coat of arms. Today, Dr. Nicolas Zuel and his team of conservationists are working hard to ensure other endemic species don't go the way of the dodo. DR. NICOLAS ZUEL, CONSERVATION MANAGER, EBONY FOREST: Before human beings came to Mauritius, the forest would look like what you see around us. ASHER: Less 2 percent of the native forest remains on the island, due in part to poaching, pollution and logging. Historically, one of the most sought after resources, the ebony tree, is coveted for its durable black hardwood which is used to build furniture, cabinets, piano keys. And more now the global trade of ebony wood is controlled and most species have been protected to prevent extinction. ZUEL: The history of Mauritius is closely linked to ebony trees because when the Dutch colonized the island, one of the reason, the main reason they wanted to colonize the island is to be able to exploit the ebony trees. ASHER: The journey to restore this patch of forest located on the southwest part of the island began in 2006. The work started with weeding, planting and growing native plant species. It also involved the reintroduction of locally extinct species like the pink pigeon and the echo parakeet, both considered vulnerable and globally threatened. ZUEL: It's important to have birds because forest restoration and the animal battle (ph) live in it goes hand in hand. So without (INAUDIBLE) the forest will not survive. So, yes we are linked to extinction of species with the dodo, but we're also an example of what can be done to save our bird species. ASHER: After 11 years of restoration initiatives, the ebony forest park officially opened to the public in 2017.  Visitors can bird watch, hike or volunteer and contribute to the conservation efforts on this tropical island paradise.  ZUEL: So it's really important for us to have ebony forest to raise awareness about species, about conservation. So that's something which is really important for us to just work together with people, share the knowledge and also learn from others. ASHER: To date, the conservationists say they've planted more than 140,000 endemic plants while also weeding and planting 16 additional hectares of forest.  With the dodo's legacy in mind, the ultimate goal is to safeguard the island's natural glory for generations to come. ZUEL: And ultimately, osmosis as lots of endemic species, it's a narrative but for the old world what we are preserving here. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: We are shaking things up with some researchers from the University of California, San Diego, for today's story getting a 10 out of 10.  A group of engineers built and tested the tallest full-scale building ever on an earthquake simulator or shake table. Ten stories high, shaken like a salt shaker in simulations of two of the strongest quakes in recent history a 6.7 and a 7.7 magnitude, and the historic tests were a success. The building was damage free. The data is going to be used to help design safer buildings and bridges. I try to come up with some good puns for that story but they were all shaky at best. Sorry, my fault. Hope it doesn't cause a rift between us. Tiffin, Iowa, you get our special shout out today. Clear Creek Amana Middle School, you rock. And Mr. Wilmer, we see you.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Wonderful Wednesday to you. We're halfway through to a week, and we're going to keep on grinding and shining because that's just what we do. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news. Remember to keep your ear out today for your vocab word in today's show. We begin today through the confusion in the nation's capital. Check out this photo. Looks pretty real, right? Well, it's not. This fake image appears to show a major explosion near the Pentagon, but experts say the image has all the makings of being generated by AI or artificial intelligence. It was even shared by numerous verified Twitter accounts with blue check marks, including one falsely claiming it was associated with Bloomberg News. The fake image from the fake account posted, "Large Explosion near The Pentagon Complex in Washington, D.C. -- Initial Report.  Well, local officials were cognizant of these false reports, and they confirmed that no such incident occurred. And experts said the building in the image doesn't even closely resemble the Pentagon. The Fire Department in Arlington, Virginia responded in a tweet stating that the department and the Pentagon Forest Protection Agency were, "aware of a social media report circulating online about an explosion near the Pentagon." There is no explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public." Now, this mayhem and confusion even impacted the stock market, with Wall Street seeing a brief dip during the trading day. This fake image even tricked some international news outlets. False reports making their way to air on major Indian television network Republic TV.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Explosion reported near Pentagon. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Which cited reports from the Russian news outlet RT. The news outlet later retracted that report when it became clear that the incident never took place. Our Donie O'Sullivan has more on this viral hoax.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  There's two parts of this, right? There's, first is Elon Musk's Twitter. And a lot of your viewers might remember the whole saga about the blue check marks on Twitter, the verified checkmarks. Musk has basically taken all of those away and is selling them now to people who want to get a blue check mark.  So whereas before, if you had a blue tick on Twitter, it meant that Twitter had verified you are the person or the organization you're claiming to be. That's not really the case. So what happened this morning was somebody posted using an account that they claimed was linked to the Bloomberg News organization, posting that AI generated image and claiming there had been some kind of explosion at the Pentagon. That then got shared across multiple other verified accounts that we saw it on other platforms, too. It looked quite coordinated, but we don't know right now who pushed this.  Multiple experts we've spoken to and others who have observed this online say that that is an image generated by artificial intelligence. And you can see there particularly people who are familiar with Washington that the building in the picture is not the Pentagon. But, you know, it just goes to show, even with a crude fake like this and some verified accounts on Twitter, that, you know, you could still cause a lot of trouble. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. In what country would find the highest point in the Western Hemisphere?  Ecuador, Argentina, United States or Canada?  Argentina is your answer here. Aconcagua is a mountain part of the Andes mountains, rising to around 22,000 feet. All right. Argentina has a massive, nearly 2-million-acre park called Ibera National Park, with thousands of plant and animal species and now they're reintroducing the largest cats on the continent, jaguars. Awesome cats like the Collegiate Cougars in Richmond, Virginia.  Now, bringing these jaguars back to the park's ecosystem is part of the restoration or rewilding efforts happening there. Our Bill Weir has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT:  In the upper right corner of Argentina, you will find a lush land brimming with life, a park called Ibera, the home to 4000 species of plants and animals. Near the very top of that intricate food chain and vital to keeping it balanced, is the majestic jaguar. But until 2021, the biggest cat in South America had not been seen in the wild here for 70 years.  KRISTINE TOMPKINS, PRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER TOMPKINS CONSERVATION:  When we decided to try to reintroduce jaguars back into the Ibera ecosystem, we had to first understand what happened to them in the first place? So we went back in, it's not hard to find. And you see why there are no jaguars left in this 2-million-acre territory.  Kris and Doug Tompkins made a fortune in adventure gear and fashion, but now hold the legacy of launching what Chris calls a world first breeding program aimed at reintroducing keystone species back into the region.  TOMPKINS:  Almost eleven years later, now we have between 14 and 18 jaguars living in the wild and we have seven individuals who are sort of on deck to be released.  WEIR:  It's the fruit of a labor Kris and Doug began Decades ago when they traded in high powered lives and fashion for a cabin off the grid, deep in Patagonia. TOMPKINS:  The roots of Tompkins conservation sprouted when Doug, after a really successful business career, went back to Chile and Argentina in the early 90s, looking for a way to give back to the two countries he loved so much. And to help nature begin to heal itself.  WEIR:  Doug's vision involved a rewilding approach to conservation, and he began by buying up millions of acres, turning ranches back into grassland and forest, and then giving it all away with the creation of new, National Parks. TOMPKINS:  To create the system where species that have gone missing have the space and the safety to come back and not be extincted again.  WEIR:  Along with its offshoots Rewilding Argentina and Rewilding Chile, Tompkins conservation has conserved around 15 million acres over the last three decades. And after tragically losing her husband Doug to a kayaking accident in 2015, Kris Tompkins carries on the dream. This Photograph is a picture of Doug and me flying in the little plane, which we did nearly every day, and really understanding the territories that we were becoming interested in and would eventually develop as national parks. WEIR:  To date, their donated land has inspired the creation or expansion of 15 national parks. And in addition to the jaguar, they've successfully reintroduced 13 other species, like the giant anteater, collared peccary and pampas deer. So here's an example of community members. A species that had gone extinct and is back now, and a team member that tells the whole story. Rescuing an orphaned anteater cub.  TOMPKINS:  Come on, boy, let's go.  I feel extraordinary pride for what we've done so far, but I'm definitely not satisfied. I'm happy about the past, but I am completely focused on the future. What will we be talking about in 10 years? So we can elevate ourselves because of what's been done in the past. What can we do now? What are we doing now?  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  A runaway cow sprinting alongside traffic is today's story getting a 10 out of 10 drivers had to move out of the way as a bodacious bovine barreled on by leaving people completely bumfuzzled along a Michigan highway. It was a high-speed chase with high stakes. You've seen Jeep Wranglers on the road before, but how about this type of wrangler? A cowboy, complete with a lasso, reigning in the rambling runner. Did you know cows can run up to about 25 miles per hour? That cow was milking its freedom for all it was worth. Utterly amazing. Hey, what do you call a cow with no legs? Ground beef.  So many great Your Word Wednesday submissions yesterday. Winners are Atirza (ph) and Lily and Stacy from Wilcox Academy for bumfuzzled, an adjective meaning confused or perplexed.  And from Arthur Hills High in Saginaw, Michigan, cognizant, an adjective meaning having knowledge of or being aware of. Well done. We hope that you are all cognizant of the fact that we're thankful for you. Our special shout out goes Taylor Reed (ph) Middle School in Alpharetta, Georgia. Rise up, go out and make someone smile today. All right. I'm Coy Wire and we are CNN 10. END230525

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. It's time to rise up and fuel our minds. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. It's Thursday. Happy Friday Eve. Can you believe this is the penultimate show of the year? The second to last one before CNN 10 summer break. I'm going to miss y'all. But I'm going to keep posting food for thought on my @coywire social account. Stuff like hashtag, random thought Thursday. Now, if you know the answer to this one, keep it to yourself. We'll reveal the answer at the end of the show.  Here we go. There are 30 cows in a field, 28 chickens. How many didn't? Think about it? All right, let's go.  Here we go. Starting today in the pacific ocean in the U.S. territory of Guam, where officials say they're experiencing the worst storm in decades, Typhoon Mawar has been slamming the island with heavy rain and strong winds, reaching speeds equivalent to those that a category four hurricane would bring. Now, did you know that typhoons and hurricanes are actually the same weather phenomenon? The difference is purely geographical. Hurricanes are in the north Atlantic and northeast pacific oceans. Typhoons like Mawar, well, they're in the northwest pacific. These scenes from Guam are scary. The national weather service has warned that the storm could bring 15 to 20 inches of torrential rain or more. This can result in landslides and flash flooding throughout the island. According to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, maximum sustained winds were up to 140 mph, with gusts up to 165. It's like being subjected to tornado like wind speeds, but for long periods of time. Most of the island has lost power. But thankfully, at the time of this recording, no deaths have been reported to CNN.  President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for the island on Tuesday. And FEMA, the federal emergency management agency, announced it has more than 50 emergency relief personnel and dozens of other federal partners ready to provide emergency assistance on the ground.  Guam is home to about 150,000 people, including several U.S. military installations. Now, while Guam sits in the West Pacific ocean, an area that's prone to the world's strongest tropical cyclones, it's actually extremely rare for the island to be struck directly by a storm of this strength. Only eight such storms like this have passed over this 30 miles wide island in the last 75 years.  Ten second trivia.  Think fast. What part of the brain is most closely linked to thinking and reasoning? Brain Stem, Cerebrum, Cerebellum or Hypothalamus? If you're thinking cerebrum. Oh, synapse, I think neuron to something. Cerebrum for the win.  Neuroscientists at the University of Texas say they figured out a way to read minds by translating scans of brain activity into actual words using the very same artificial intelligence technology that powers ChatGPT. Now, does this mean that we could possibly communicate with someone who's unable or even unwilling? Pop quiz, hotshot. How do brains say, hi, brainwaves. Our Donie O'Sullivan has more.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You're reading people's minds? ALEXANDER HUTH, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, UT AUSTIN:  So we don't like to use the term mind reading.  O'SULLIVAN:  These neuroscientists at the University of Texas in Austin say they've made a major breakthrough. They've figured out how to translate brain activity into words using artificial intelligence.  HUTH:  These are different images.  O'SULLIVAN:  Earlier this month, they published a paper explaining how they had research. Volunteers listened to audio clips while having their brains scanned by an fMRI machine. Over time, AI algorithms, the very same tech that's behind ChatGPT, were able to figure out what the volunteers were listening to just by watching their brains. (On camera): It is just crazy. You can watch how blood flows through the brain. And using AI and GPT and everything else translated into words? HUTH:  Yeah, it's wild that this works when you put it that way.  HUTH:  Thumbs up, Donie. O'SULLIVAN:  To test it all out, Professor Alexander Huth and I had our brain scanned while listening to parts of The Wizard of Oz audiobook.  JERRY TANG, PHD STUDENT, UT AUSTIN:  Hi, Donie, we have a picture of your brain.  O'SULLIVAN:  I have a brain?  TANG:  Yes. It looks good.  O'SULLIVAN:  I was scanned first, followed by Professor Huth, capturing images of the changes in our brain's blood flow as we listened to the words from the audiobook and showing how our brains interpreted those words.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When she had finished her meal and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan nearby. TANG:  You can see that they're getting recordings every two seconds while he's listening to a story. We will feed this data through our decoder and try to predict the story that he's currently listening to.  O'SULLIVAN:  The next morning, the results were in.  (On camera):  OK, so it's been 24 hours since we got our brain scanned. You can confirm I have a brain? HUTH:  Absolutely. O'SULLIVAN:  Brilliant.  HUTH:  So we were able to decode some stuff from my brain, not so much from yours. So this is one from my brain. This is from The Wizard of Oz. So on the left side is the actual words that I heard. When she had finished her meal and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan nearby.  And the decoded version of this is on the right. I was about to head back to school and I hear this strange voice calling out to me. So it gets some things right. So this like, was about to go back, was about to head back. It completely misses some things like the road of yellow brick versus school, but then it gets this nice kind of example. So she hears something and then instead of a deep groan nearby, it said a strange voice calling out to me. That means something related, even if it's not exactly the right words.  O'SULLIVAN:  Still pretty incredible to think that was about to head back as something that. Just by scanning your brain.  HUTH:  Yeah, I think that's one of the things that's really surprising to us about this. It can get things like that, can get these entire phrases of exact words now.  O'SULLIVAN:  So we expected mine not to be great? HUTH:  Because we haven't trained the model on you.  O'SULLIVAN:  The reason it wasn't able to decode my brain was because the technology currently needs people to sit in the fMRI machine for more than 16 hours, so the AI models can train on specific people's brains. (On camera): Are we going to live in a world where, you know, I can walk by somebody on the street and they'll be able to hold something up to my head and they'll know what I'm thinking?  HUTH:  Currently, we're very far from that. That might also never be possible. We can't completely rule it out, but as far as we know, that certainly won't be possible in the next few decades. The real potential application of this is actually helping people who are unable to speak without them needing to get neurosurgery. TANG:  Now, we have this, like, snapshot of the brain. And Jerry Tang explains how they used OpenAI's GPT large language model to help decode the brain. The GPT model is made up of millions of pages of text from the Internet that the AI trains on and learns how sentences are constructed and how people talk and think. GPT basically made our predictions a lot better.  O'SULLIVAN:  But it doesn't just work listening to audio. Professor Huth showed us what happened when he watched a movie with no sound while his brain was scanned. Watch as the technology is able to decode what his eyes are seeing. HUTH:  She then took my hand and held it to her lips. She kissed it. I smiled.  O'SULLIVAN:  Oh, my God.  HUTH:  And she put me in for a hug. I got her back for about hours. I had to stop the bleeding and gave her my shirt to put over it. It's pretty good.  I don't know. It's a pretty good description of what was happening here.  O'SULLIVAN:  Wow. Should we be scared by the work people like you are doing?  TANG:  We think it's really important to continually evaluate the implications of brain decoding and also to start thinking about enacting policies that protect mental privacy and regulate what brain data can be used for. O'SULLIVAN:  Mental privacy a rather dystopian term, but ones that we're going to be getting more used to as we enter this age of artificial intelligence. Back to you.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  To all of our band members and musicians out there, imagine you're practicing, you're playing with your crew, and all of a sudden a music superstar crashes your jam session and starts jamming with you. Well, Ed Sheeran, you get today's 10 out of 10 for making a Florida High School's band practice unforgettable and then giving even more of a surprise. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ED SHEERAN:  I thought I'd come and play some songs to you. I've also brought some guitars to give to you guys from the music department.  (CHEERING & APPLAUSE) SHEERAN:  I'm playing sold out stadium tomorrow, but I've got tickets for all of you guys to come.  (CHEERING & APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Sheeran sang his hits song called Perfect. And it was perfect. Some students tearing up. It was so beautiful. All have took photos and even signed some instruments. He performed a duet with one of the students too. And how about the sweet note he left? Love you guys. That's sweet. And love to you too. And mahalo or thanks to everyone, like Mrs. Santiago's class in Hawaii, who've subscribed to our CNN 10 YouTube channel. Our school shoutout is going to Lake Stevens High School in Lake Stevens, Washington. And Mr. Heyman, happy birthday to you. Now, for that random thought Thursday. There are 30 cows in the field, 28 chickens. How many didn't? Well, if you know the answer, shout it out. Go ahead. Answer is 10, 30 cows, 28 chickens, that means 10 didn't.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. It's Friday, Friyay, our final show of the season. But we will be creating some content here. And I have some fun stuff planned on @coywire, on Insta, Snapchat and TikTok as well. Without further ado, let's do what we do. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, and we start with a thought provoker. What do you see when you read this below? Don't say it aloud. Just raise your hand if you see this. Opportunity is nowhere. OK, good.  Now raise your hand if you saw this instead. Opportunity is now here. Even better, this is a good reminder for us that life isn't about what we see, but how we see it. We should always try to remember to see the good and the positive in anything we encounter, so we can attack our days with hope and optimism and bring some positive vibes to our day.  Now, to the news. Let's head to about 45 miles southeast of Mexico City, Mexico for the latest developments on the country's most dangerous active volcano. It's called Popocatepetl, and numerous explosions have been recorded in recent days. Some 25 million people live within a 60 miles radius of this volcano. Schools and dozens of municipalities have been closed. The volcano's ash even wreaking havoc in the air, Benito Juarez International Airport, delaying flights, even temporarily closing last weekend. Authorities say millions of people have been told to prepare for a possible evacuation. The U.S. embassy in Mexico has issued a warning saying the volcano has exhibited increased activity since May 15, registering hundreds of tremors and smoke and ash exhalations.  The volcano had been dormant for decades, but erupted in 1994, and since then, its rumblings have become a part of the daily lives of the residents. Our Patrick Oppmann has more.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Mexico's most dangerous active volcano once again is putting residents on alert as over the last several days there have been eruptions witnessed at the Popocatepetl volcano and that is causing officials to raise the level of alert to a yellow alert which indicates that residents, and there are millions of residents who live in the vicinity of this volcano may need to consider evacuating should this volcano erupt. Already there has been a duration of the air quality as ash has gone into the area. It has caused residents to have to swoop up the ash on the streets, so officials are warning people to make sure that the ash does not get into their water supply. Some schools have been closed as well, have some parks. There have been flights that have been delayed as a result of the ash, because, of course, ash, once it is emitted into the atmosphere, can be very damaging, very dangerous cure to air travel. At this point, officials say that because this is an active volcano that's been active now for some years, that they are simply in a position of observing the volcano, that they feel they would have enough time before any major eruption to warn residents to begin evacuating. That appeared to be less ash that had been admitted by the volcano on Tuesday. But all the same, as people in these Mexican states keep a close eye on this volcano and what could happen next. No one is breathing a sigh of relief just yet. Patrick Oppmann, CNN, Havana.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  This Monday marks Memorial Day in the U.S. The federal holiday where Americans honor and pay tribute to those who've lost their lives while serving in the military. The day which also signals the unofficial start to summer, originated in the years following the Civil War, which ended in 1865, the country establishing a Decoration Day where the nation could decorate the graves of those who died in war with flowers. Well, over 100 years later, in 1971, Congress made it an official holiday. CNN had the chance to speak with a few veterans in active-duty military about the first time they knew they wanted to serve their country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRANDON RUMBAUGH, CORPORAL RET. U.S. MARINE CORPS: When I was laying there, I really, you know, didn't think that I was going to make it. The Marines that were around me. I'm sure that they didn't think I was going to make it either. So, you know, it really shows me that I'm here for a reason. What really made things clear for me was looking back at my life up to, you know, this point. I always did everything for myself and I never really took a step back and said, you know what, I just need to start doing things for other people. And I knew that I could do that in the Marines.  JAMES BROWN, FORMER SERGEANT, U.S. AIR FORCE: My dad was furious. My dad didn't talk to me for like a solid month. He really hated it when I said, I was on leave to go to the military. I'm from Chicago originally. I'm from the south side. We thought that, you know, the scholarship and education, I stuff that I had would get me out of the hood, you know, which it did. But I wanted to get farther out the net. I had higher aspirations of that I want to get out of the country. And the Air Force was supposed to be the most intelligent branch of the service. I went all over. I mean, I went to Scotland, I went to Wales, I went to -- every time I had a chance to get off, I went somewhere. I traveled somewhere. ELEANOR RIZZUTO, LIEUTENANT RET. U.S. ARMY: At 21, I was just finishing my nurse's training when World War II broke out. In fact, we were on the chow line when, over the loudspeaker, it was announced that the war had started. Being in the service made me grow up. I was a young girl, just lived home, and all of a sudden, you're thrown out with all kinds of people and places that you read about but never saw. It was quite an experience. It's something I'm very happy I did, but I would never want to do it again. FLORENT GROBERG, CAPT. RET. U.S. ARMY, MDEAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT: My uncle was killed by a terrorist organization, and I knew at that point that I wanted to fight against those type of individuals. And so I graduated from Ranger school in October 23 of 2009, and just about six weeks later, I was in Afghanistan. ARNIE ALBORNOZ, FORMER MAJOR, U.S. ARMY: Growing up in South Shore, Long Islands, you hear about West Point, which is where I was fortunate enough to go to college. I was a junior when 911 happened. I distinctly remember being in class. No one was teaching. We were just sitting there watching. Everyone was in shock. Most of the professors there are active-duty military. Each one had made a comment to the effect of, you know, cadets. We don't know what's going to happen, we don't know what this means, but your nation's going to call on you to go serve. I never thought I'd stay in for 10 years, but I enjoyed it very much so. And it was the best job I've ever had in my life and likely will ever have. So I look back on it with just the fondest memories. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten second trivia.  What are Saturn's rings believed to be made of? Rock and ice, gas and iron, palladium and ash, or copper?  According to NASA, the rings around Saturn are composed of rock and ice.  Could Saturn's iconic rings be disappearing? NASA's Cassini mission orbited Saturn between 2004 and 2017, and a new study is revealing fresh insights into when they might vanish. The data suggests that Saturn's rings are young by celestial body standards, that is possibly a few hundred million years old. And researchers estimate the rings will only be around for another few hundred million more. Some astronomers have argued that Saturn's bright, icy rings might be younger than expected because they haven't been eroded or darkened by interactions with meteoroids across billions of years. The city of Kyle asking everyone named Kyle to rise up for a record largest same name gathering. Well, that's today's story getting a 10 out of 10. Piles of Kyles from miles and miles. Even Canada, gathering in the tiny Texas city, 1490 of them. Well, Kyle be darned, they missed the Guinness world record set by 2325 Ivans in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2017. Still, huge salute to all of you and hope it wasn't too confusing anytime someone shouted, hey, Kyle. Speaking of shoutouts, I am so grateful to all of you, teachers, administrators, parents, and students like our friends at Mr. Cummings class at Marsh Creek in Downingtown, PA, thank you for making me part of your day. And thanks to my team, Jeremy, Jairbear (ph), Jackie, Jocelyn and Nader, Sophie, McKenna, and Maya. You all work so hard to make this show the best 10 minutes in news for all of you. We're going to miss you until we're back with our Daily Shows in August. So to all of you, and especially all of our seniors out there, go and be great. Remember, greatness isn't just innate, it's something you cultivate. Outwork everyone, every single day. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. You are more powerful than you know.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, all you superstars rising in bright light shining, happy Friyay. Let's finish this week strong and dominate before we start dreaming and scheming for the weekend, two days of endless possibilities. Those were just around the corner. But today we're going to take you from Hawaii to Colorado, then to the Peruvian wilds, but first San Francisco for our futuristic roadblock.  California recently decided that some Robo taxi companies can operate driverless cars around the clock in San Francisco. The decision passed in a three to one vote by regulators. Before the vote, the approved companies, Cruise and Waymo could only offer limited service to locals. But now you can hail a self-driving taxi in the golden city at any time, but the venture already hit its first roadblock.  Literally over the weekend, self-driving cars owned by crews caused a traffic jam downtown. Witnesses say the cars blocked intersections for about 15 minutes. Imagine if this happened and you were going to be late getting somewhere, you can run, but you can't ride. Some are worried that these types of conundrums might block emergency vehicles, too.  Local police, fire, and sheriff's associations have all expressed similar concerns in letters to the California Public Utilities Commission. And the San Francisco Fire Department, well, they told CNN it has recorded more than 50 incidents of driverless cars interfering with emergency responses just this year alone. Cruise addressed the traffic jam on social media explaining that a nearby music festival had affected wireless bandwidth, delaying the connection to the driverless cars. The company has told CNN though that it's 24/7 driverless service is a major milestone. One that could make transportation safer and more accessible. What say you sunshine? Is the world ready for self-driving cars? Are self-driving cars ready to be self-driving cars? Or do you think we should just park this idea for a bit? I know, sorry. Car puns are exhausting.  Next up, we have a new report from CNN's Chief Climate Correspondent, Bill Weir on the Hawaiian island of Maui where deadly fires continue to burn. More than 100 people have lost their lives in the disaster. Many more still missing. In Maui's upcountry, Bill met volunteer first responders who are taking desperate measures to put out the flames and a family that's still holding onto hope for a missing mother. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  With an upcountry fire, not fully contained Maui's Fire Department stretched painfully thin and winds kicking up once again, some residents around Kula are using sprinklers and hope to protect their homes.  (On camera):  Whoa, careful, careful.  (Voice-over):  And I met volunteer first responders trying to knock down hot spots with bottled water. (On camera):  Oh man, you can feel the heat. MERILL KALOPODES, VOLUNTEER:  Because there's a smoldering pit over there.  WEIR:  Oh.  KALOPODES:  And all it needs is a good wind to -- to get it going. By the time we got there, it was already flaming.  WEIR:  Really?  KALOPODES:  Yeah, it was -- it was started off with just a little smoke and then we said, OK, let's get some water, haul it over there. And then by the time we got over there, it started -- it started flaming already. So, you know, we're going to go back and go put some more water on it. WEIR:  In this city, smokey brush one wrong step into smoldering ash means a burn foot.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's what happened there. I went to go check that one. And the -- and the switch's so deep, you can't get through it. WEIR:  But they stay added until they're spotted by a helicopter dropping water, scooped from swimming pools and they finally get the help they need. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. Located at the border of Nevada and Arizona, the Hoover Dam controls the flow of what water? Yellowstone River, Colorado River, Rio Grande, or Missouri River?  This national historic landmark is located on the Colorado River. Let's take a ride down the Colorado river now. It's an important waterway that has been shrinking steadily over the past century. For the first time in years, a strong snow pack has raised water levels on the river and federal officials are easing water restrictions in response. The decision could restore billions of gallons of H2O to affected states. But as CNN Correspondent, Lucy Kafanov found out, some people think it's too soon to celebrate. Hold on As we join her in Utah on a raft ride down the iconic river. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SINJIN EBERLE, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, AMERICAN RIVERS:  This river is iconic. LUCY KAFANOV, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Sinjin Eberle has spent much of his life on the Colorado River. EBERLE:  It's a remarkable, remarkable area of the world. KAFANOV:  As an avid adventurer and Colorado River advocate, his mission in life is to protect it.  EBERLE:  This is one of the most important places in the nation. And it's one of the places that we need to be really diligent about taken care of because it -- it does contribute so much to all of us.  KAFANOV:  The Colorado River is the lifeblood of this region. Powering cities, watering farms, and quenching the thirst of some 40 million people. It's a critical refuge for wildlife and a playground that's under threat. EBERLE:  It's being overused. There's more demand on the river. There's more water being taken out of the river than the river can handle. If we continue to over extract the bank account, we are going to run dry.  KAFANOV:  An unusually wet and snowy winter brought some relief, replenishing snow pack and boosting water levels for the first time in years. But with the rapidly changing climate experts are warning, it's not enough. EBERLE:  It's been so hot and so dry in the Southwest. That much of the benefit we got out of the snow pack is literally evaporated. KAFANOV:  The one or two extra wet winters is not going to solve this crisis? EBERLE:  My concern is that people will assume that the situation is getting much better and that we can take our foot off the gas in terms of conservation. This system can crash and it can crash fast. KAFANOV:  Over the last century, the river has shrunk by roughly 20%. Those losses are more apparent in the lower basin states, but the impacts are being felt across the entire waterway. (On camera):  Raft into Colorado is a breathtaking experience. It's a slow and sometimes bumpy ride through ancient time at a moment when it seems like the Earth's clock is speeding up. Even here, the effect of climate change, rapid growth and water over consumption are threatening the very existence of this river. DAVIDE IPPOLITO, COLORADO RIVER RAFTING GUIDE:  We boat through Cataract Canyon. It's the best roller coaster in north America. Class IV Rapids all the way down when it's high water. And yet my most dangerous part of my job is when I get to this ramp, it's extremely dangerous. KAFANOV:  The river has shrunk so much that it's nearly impossible for Colorado River guides like Davide Ippolito to pull boats out of the water. IPPOLITO:  It's kind of like pyramid building. You have guides putting roller tubes underneath boats, as that boat is pulled up, guides are running and putting those tubes under until we get to flat land on top like ancient Egyptian technology, literally. KAFANOV:  It's such a hassle that many tours now float an extra 50 miles downstream adding up to two days, not to mention cost to a trip. What worries Ippolito more than the business impact is the threat to future generations. IPPOLITO:  So if we want to live out west and we want to protect our heritage out here and we want to have enough water for our kids and grandkids, then we need to solve these issues now. It's -- it's no longer problem we can kick down the line. KAFANOV:  A sentiment echoed by Eberle. EBERLE:  It would be heartbreaking to lose this place. KAFANOV:  Lucy Kafanov, CNN on the Colorado River in Moab. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's story, getting a 10 out of 10 from Otishi National Park in Peru, a group of researchers making history, discovering a brand-new species of snake. They named the yellow brown serpent after action hero, Harrison Ford, AKA Indiana Jones. And I'm rep telling you that's witty, because Indiana Jones was famously afraid of snakes. Tachymenoides harrisonfordi is the name. Now, I don't know slither or not, you're afraid of snakes, but if you are, you just might have ophidiophobia or an extreme fear of snakes.  Special shout out to home of the Mustangs, New Washington, Middle and New Washington High School in new Washington, Indiana. Thanks for subscribing in commenting on our CNN 10 YouTube Channel for a shout out. Let's go out now and make this world a bit of a better place today. Shall we?

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello and happy Monday, sunshine. I hope you had a wonderful weekend. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, here to help you fuel your mind and dominate this week and have a little fun while doing it.  First, though, our lead story of the day, a hurricane with fierce winds and heavy downpours, it's forced residents in Southern California to evacuate and first responders to brace for water rescues as it was expected to slam into the U.S. coastline yesterday.  Hurricane Hilary was a Category 1 storm with maximum winds of 80 miles per hour at the time of this recording, as it moved on a north, northwest path at 21 miles per hour. It was expected to weaken to a tropical storm before reaching the coast. But large swells were likely to create life threatening surf and rip current conditions.  The California governor's office said Hilary could be the wettest tropical cyclone in state history. And one of the most devastating storms in more than a decade, the national oceanic and atmospheric administration or NOAA said, if Hilary makes landfall in California as a tropical storm, it would be the first to do so in the state in nearly 84 years, storms like this rarely hit California because of the cold currents off the coast. They tend to weaken storms and act as somewhat of a shield around Western coast there. Parts of California and even Nevada and Arizona could suddenly receive a year's worth of rain or more.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM, (D) CALIFORNIA: So today I assign an emergency declaration of proclamation in preparation of the storms. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE: California Governor Gavin Newsom proclaimed a State of Emergency Saturday for a large swath of Southern parts of the state. With up to 10 inches of rain expected in some areas, winds were expected to knock out power for many on Sunday and Monday.  Parts of Mexico, roughly a 300-mile stretch along the Baja, California Peninsula were also under hurricane warning with "locally catastrophic flash and urban flooding," according to the Hurricane Center. CNN's Natasha Chen was in Southern California ahead of this rare storms impact. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA CHEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is a weather event that's created a lot of questions for people in Southern California because they have never seen a tropical storm warning. And the last time a tropical storm made landfall in California was more than 80 years ago. So, a lot of people are wondering what exactly they should do. Officials have said a lot of the preparations that folks would've made for winter storms and flooding months ago apply here asking people to please take advantage of the sandbags that are being given out to bring materials indoors, to not go outside or drive in the weather on Sunday and Monday, if they don't have to.  Officials have also been very proactive and going to outdoor areas where there are encampments of unhoused people trying to convince them to take shelter inside before the storm, really comes through the most intense of which is supposed to be Sunday afternoon, at least through the San Diego area with very strong rains and winds. We are seeing a lot of events being canceled or postponed.  In fact, Major League Baseball moved their Sunday games to Saturday. There are concerts like ones at the Hollywood bowl being canceled. The U.S. Navy has even temporarily moved their ships and submarines away from San Diego just during this storm, at least until it passes through. Catalina island in Los Angeles county has been warned for people to -- they're strongly encouraged to leave that island that they're likely to get hit. A lot of high-water rescue vehicles prepositioned. A lot of personnel out there ready to act as soon as this weather comes through. JENNIFER GRAY, CNN METEOROLOGIST: In the U.S. flash floods kill more people than tornadoes, hurricanes or lightning, a flash flood creates a rush of moving water that can sweep a grown man off his feet, a car off the road, and even your entire home off its foundation. When the ground becomes so saturated that water can no longer seep into the soil, it begins to run off quickly into rivers and streams and this causes a rise in water and a flash.  Densely populated areas have an extremely high-risk of flash flooding with the additional concrete and less grassy areas for the water to soak into the soil. And they can see flash flooding very quickly. And mountain is terrain the combination of gravity. Plus, the easy runoff can lead to catastrophic flooding. When all of that water is funneled into rivers creeks, and even the valleys.  Remember flash flooding can happen in the blink of an eye. That's why it's important to stay alert and pay attention in case a flash flood watch or warning is issued for your area. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Ten second trivia. Which of these locations would be found on the moon? Plain of Jars, Sea of Tranquility, Crater Lake or Mount Olympus? All of these sites are actually located on earth, except the Sea of Tranquility. Chosen for its smooth flat terrain, the Sea of Tranquility was the site of the first moon landing by the U.S. in 1969. But did you know that there's a new space race going on between the United States, China, India, and Russia. And the big focus is landing on the moon's Southern pole. Why the lunar Southern pole, it's all about terrain and lighting, large mountains and deep craters at the south pole of the moon create permanently shadowed and very cold areas that scientists believe could hold ice that would have valuable scientific information, but that terrain and those conditions make for a difficult landing.  And on Sunday, there was a major setback for Russia's space program. Roscosmos, Russia's Space Agency reported that their Luna-25 space crafts crashed into the surface of the moon. This was set to be Russia's first lunar Lander in 47 years, the pilotless craft would've been the first ever craft to land on the moon south pole. But it went spinning uncontrollably while in orbit.  So next up is India. India's pilotless craft is scheduled to make a lunar landing there just two days from now. India's last attempt to land on the moon in 2019, ended with that craft also crashing into the moon surface. The U.S. while they're aiming to be the first country to land there with a crude mission planned for 2025.  China, they're also hoping to land there before the end of the decade. As it stands only the United States, the Soviet Union and China have successfully soft landed anywhere on the moon  And for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, we're hanging 10. Well, this silly marine mammal making waves in San Diego, it's become a bit of a celebrity among local surfers there who say it brings them pure joy. CNN's Jeanne Moos seals the deal. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT: There's a rookie surfer off the coast of San Diego and all of the human surfers have given him their seal of approval. JENNY KIM, SURFER: A moment of pure happiness for me. MOOS: Jenny Kim gladly made room for this Harbor seal pop on her surfboard day after day, he showed up at Pacific beach and hung out with those who usually hang tan. Even marine experts like seaworld's Jeni Smith were mystified. JENI SMITH, SAN DIEGO SEAWORLD, RESCUE SUPERVISOR: For some odd reason was hopping from surfboard to surfboard to surfboard, definitely not normal. MOOS: Harbor seals are usually standoffish, but this one was extra friendly. Chill climbing aboard rolling off. Instead of being antisocial, he was in sync riding the waves with banded. The surfers named him Sammy after the children's book.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sammy The Seal. MOOS: The man who shot this drone footage, Ed Hartel found the seal inspiring.  ED HARTEL, VIDEOGRAPHER: In a time of darkness, this has been the light. MOOS: Seaworld San Diego's phone rang off the hook with calls about Sammy their rescue team checked on him and found him healthy. Why would he gravitate to surf boards? SMITH: My first instinct was maybe there's sharks in the water. MOOS: Sharks have killed seals and sea lions at this beach. But Jeni says, Sammy seemed calm and unafraid. KIM: His face was really close to him as if he's he was going to kiss me like. MOOS: Sealed, not with a kiss, but a sniff. She posted on Instagram, never getting rid of this board. KIM: Such a magical moment of connection with the nature. MOOS: When the beach boys said, everybody, who knew everybody would include Sammy The Seal. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Serving USA. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Finally, my favorite part of the day, special shoutout to Lake County Middle School in Ridgeley, Tennessee, go Falcons. Fun fact about Falcons, did you know that some Falcons can see their prey from more than a mile away? And when they spot that pray, look out, they can swoop down with mind blowing speed, a pair of green Falcon named frightful set the world record in 1999, diving down at 242 miles per hour.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello beautiful people. Welcome to another episode of CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news. And it's the best because of you. Bonus shout out to start today's show Mr. Neves in the history class at Cumberland High School in Cumberland Rhode Island. You rock. Let's get this show rocking and rolling, shall we? We start with an update on Hurricane Hilary. By the time Hilary made landfall early Sunday, it had downgraded to a tropical storm, that means the maximum winds drop below 74 miles per hour. This Tropical Storm tore into the Mexican Peninsula of Baja California, killing at least one person before crossing the border to California.  There, Hilary continued a destructive path setting records along the way. Sunday morning Death Valley received a month's worth of rain in one hour. Downtown Los Angeles was hit with nearly two and a half inches of rain, breaking a record for a rainy summer day that goes back nearly 150 years.  Palm Springs saw about half a year's worth of rain only in just a six hours' time. As of Monday morning, Hilary had lost its tropical status and was reclass to a post tropical cyclone, a rotating storm that can still carry heavy rain and strong winds. And it did Hilary traveled north hitting central Nevada with 35 mile per hour winds triggering multiple warnings of life-threatening floods across Southern California and Nevada. More than 25 million people were placed under flood watches as a result. If you're joining us from out west we hope you, your families and friends are safe and well. WIRE:  10 second trivia. American educator, Frank Cyr, is best known for contributions to what?  Mathematics, Physical fitness, School buses or Whiteboards? Frank Cyr is known as the father of the yellow school bus for helping to set its standards.  Fun fact about those yellow buses. Did you know that about 25 million students riding the bus to school each year but this year, there's an added challenge. There's a nationwide shortage of bus drivers and that is making it tough for some students to get back to school. CNN's Athena Jones has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We are about 58 bus drivers short. ATHENA JONES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  From North Carolina to Louisiana, a rough start to the school year as districts across the country face a shortage of bus drivers. Each year about half a million buses transport some 25 million children but low pay odd hours and increased competition from companies like FedEx and Amazon are some of the factors making it harder to find drivers.  Albemarle County, Virginia getting rid of some bus stops.  CHARMANE WHITE, DIR. OF TRANSPORTATION, VA PUBLIC SCHOOLS:  It breaks my heart that we had to do that. Right now, it is a driver shortage. JONES:  Jefferson County Colorado creating what it calls bus hubs, combining stops in a central location. Some districts using staggered schedules. IRANETTA WRIGHT, SUPERINTENDENT CINCINNATI, OHIO:  We have four start times, an early start school is paired with a later start school.  JONES:  Facing a driver shortage, Kentucky's largest school district contracted with a company to map out new routes. But the plan failed, leading to a disastrous first day of kindergarten for Bethany and Ryan Baumann's daughter and forcing officials to cancel school for more than a week. BETHANY BAUMANN, PARENT:  It's like they couldn't get a hold of any of the bus drivers.  JONES:  That morning Bethany says they waited 40 minutes for the bus before she gave up and made the 10-minute drive herself. That evening, they waited more than two hours for the bus before calling the police, frantic. The superintendent vowing to do better when school restarts. DR. MARTY POLLIO, SUPERINTENDENT, KY PUBLIC SCHOOLS:  We made mistakes, but we've owned up to them and we're going to fix them.  JONES: But any long-term solution may have to address drivers paychecks. MOLLY MCGEE-HEWITT, NATIONAL ASSOC. FOR PUPIL TRANSPORTATION:  One of the key components of this shortage is compensation for drivers and that isn't in salaries and fringe benefits. It's in the workday that they're having. It's in training and assistance that they get to do their jobs. It's trying to expand out hours so that they have a full-time job. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  From buses to jeeps, we're about to meet Stacey Buckner, who modified her Jeep Wrangler to take community outreach off road and talk about a sweet ride. Stacy supports homeless veterans in North Carolina with showers, laundry and fresh meals, all from our souped-up Jeep. Our CNN Hero has helped more than 1000 veterans. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STACEY BUCKNER, CNN HERO:  There should be no homeless vets period, none. Right now there's over 30,000 homeless veterans in the United States. The number is probably greater than that. A lot of these veterans they're deep in the woods. We're going down to one of our homeless encampments. I have several veterans that I've actually been looking for that got displaced.  It's not that they don't want to be found, they don't want to be in the public eye.  (On camera):  Hey, what's up Mary, how you doing?  (Voice-over):  Gaining trust is really, really important.  (On camera):  Now y'all got to let me know sizes. So some of them we didn't have the half sizes, so we got the fun next full size.  (Voice-over):  It takes boots on the ground to get back there, find them and meet their needs.  (On camera):  All right, you're welcome. We'll get the shower set up on that side. If you guys need a shower today.  (Voice-over):  I am, to a lot of them their only family. I grew up here in Fayetteville. Fayetteville is home to Fort Liberty, formerly Fort Bragg, home of the Special Operations Command, 82nd Airborne. I think that having a base right next to your town, the passion for veterans runs really, really deep.  My stepdad is a staff sergeant, had been military. I saw, you know, things that he struggled with. I saw a gap in services for homeless veterans. And I just thought, you know, I can do something about that. And then it just kind of went on from there. I wanted to fill that gap in services that. And that's why I created offering outreach.  (On camera):  These are for Sam too. The study for short.  (Voice-over):  We provide clothing, food. There's a full kitchen in the back. We also do laundry.  (On camera):  Your pants are almost done spinning baby.  (Voice-over):  For veterans, we do wraparound services.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I like this establishment visit set up. BUCKNER (on camera):  Because this is my brick and mortar.  (Voice-over):  But obviously our services are offered to anyone at the encampment. It's just filling a basic human need.  (On camera):  You need a widely --  (Voice-over):  We also like to do pop up events, outreach events, where we will actually bring in our homeless vets, give them new socks, new shoes. (On camera):  Let's get a brigade line going man.  (Voice-over):  I get vegetables from different veteran owned farms. And we deliver fresh presents to our veterans.  (On camera):  Hey man, thanks for today. Thank you for your service. Those boxes are going to go a long way guys. So thank you. You have my number. My name is Stacey.  What are you guys in need of? It's important to show veterans that there are organizations out there that want to be your family, want to help you get through life's trials and tribulations and really provide support to you.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Good morning. Good afternoon. Good night, wherever you are in this wonderful world. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start by taking a trip to Japan today, where there are plans to release treated, radioactive wastewater into the ocean in the coming days.  You may remember 12 years ago, an undersea earthquake struck off the coast of Japan, triggering a tsunami with 30-foot waves with disastrous consequences. The quake was so strong. It moved Japan's main island by eight feet, more than 20,000 people died or went missing. The earthquake and tsunami also cut power to The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant, nuclear reactors need water to stay cool and prevent meltdowns. But at the Fukushima Daiichi Plant, those cooling systems started to fail, reactor course overheated and contaminated water inside the plant with highly radioactive material. It was Japan's worst ever nuclear disaster, and it took years for the government to lift evacuation orders near the site.  Japan was also left with tons of radioactive waste water, which it has stored and treated over the past decade. Now, the country says it's running out of space for the material and it plans to start releasing treated, diluted wastewater into the Pacific ocean as early as Thursday. There are third parties involved to monitor the release, including the International Atomic Energy Agency. That's the United Nation's nuclear watchdog, so to speak. But many remain uneasy and fear the contamination has already led some shoppers in parts of Asia to stock up on items like salt and seafood. Here's CNN International Correspondent, Anna Coren for more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A toxic blight on Japan's coastline, rising like a monument to the memory of nuclear disaster and bottling up its dangerous legacy.  Just over 12 years ago, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake off Japan's coast triggered a tsunami. Power was cut at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant. Its cooling systems stopped working and the plant went into meltdown. Water was pumped in to reduce the temperature of the reactor course becoming radioactive. 1.3 million metric tons has been kept here ever since. It's been treated to remove and dilute the most dangerous elements. On Thursday, Japan will begin to release that water into the Pacific Ocean. FUMIO KISHIDA, PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN (through translator): The offshore discharge of ALPS-treated water is an issue that cannot be postponed in order to advance the decommissioning of the plant and the reconstruction of Fukushima. COREN: The International Atomic Energy Agency backs Japan's plan to slowly feed the water into the sea, but not all the dangerous elements can be removed. A level of the hydrogen isotope called radioactive tritium will remain in the water. Japan and the IAEA says it's safe in small amounts. RAFAEL GROSSI, INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY: Tritium is present there in a very, very low concentration. And it will be diluted even further to a point that it will be negligible. COREN: The concentration of tritium released is set to come under the World Health Organization's regulatory limit, but such assurances have not been enough to assuage the fears of many in Japan and around the region.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I don't believe it at all. It's very dangerous. It contains very radioactive substances. It would become a serious problem once it's released into the ocean. We won't be able to eat fish anymore. COREN: Protests have been a constant since Japan announced its plan to release the water two years ago. Many worry about the potential for bioaccumulation of dangerous elements in the ecosystem. While neighboring countries like China have accused Japan of treating the ocean as a dumping ground. But the disaster of 2011 left Japan with few options. GROSSI: This would not happen in a normal operation of a nuclear reactor. Here you had all this accumulation and then you had to deal with it. You had to take a decision. COREN: Many difficult decisions will need to be made at Fukushima in the coming decades. Part of the reason to release the stored water is to free up space to safely decommission the plant. The legacy of the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster will be a lasting one. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Ten second trivia. With current technology, how long would it take for humans to make a roundtrip to Mars?  Six months, one year, two to three years, at least 15 years? According to NASA, a crude mission to Mars and back would take two to three years. If you are going to be floating in space for two to three years, what one food would you want to eat? Have you ever heard of the deep space food challenge? It's an international competition put on by NASA and the Canadian Space Agency to find ways to create healthy tasty foods for astronauts on long missions, like roundtrip to Mars. CNN Space and Science Writer Ashley Strickland takes us to a culinary lab in San Francisco for more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PHNAM BAGLEY, CO-FOUNDER & CREATIVE DIRECTOR, NONFICTION DESIGN: So, one thing to know about food in space is like your taste buds are not functioning. The same way as they are when you're on the surface.  The food that we give astronauts is actually quite pungent --  ASHLEY STRICKLAND, CNN SPACE AND SCIENCE WRITER: Mm-hmm. BAGLEY: -- for them to even feel anything.  STRICKLAND: Right.  BAGLEY: Yeah. So --  STRICKLAND: Good strong flavors, right?  BAGLEY: It's not going to be subtle. STRICKLAND (voice-over): Keeping astronauts healthy on long missions in space presents many challenges and food is a big one. Phnam Bagley is the Co-Founder of Nonfiction, a design firm that is one of several finalists in a NASA and Canadian Space Agency Competition called the Deep Space Food Challenge. BAGLEY: So going to Mars, and you take two and a half, three years roundtrip, and astronauts can only eat so many freeze-dried, rehydrated food before they go crazy. STRICKLAND: So what are some of these greens that we're seeing here? BAGLEY: Yes. So this is an aeroponic garden, so you can see some baby bok choy, you can see some like butter greens. STRICKLAND (voice-over): Nonfiction calls this a Culinary Lab. It's a working mockup of a modular unit that can fit into a spacecraft. It grows food has a coffee maker and can even grill meat. BAGLEY: As we all know open fires are frowned upon in space.  STRICKLAND: Right, yeah. BAGLEY: So, let's avoid that, right?  STRICKLAND: Right. BAGLEY: So what we decide to do is to use basically microwave to heat up the meat and then to essentially draw the grill pattern on the protein using laser. There we go.  STRICKLAND: Oh, wow.  BAGLEY: So this little real mark on top, kind of like depending on how wet the -- the top surface was. But makes this piece of chicken look a lot more appetizing, right? Space barbecue. STRICKLAND: Space barbecue. (Voice-over): This part of the culinary lab is what Nonfiction calls munch, it's a bioreactor that grows algae that can be harvested and eaten by the astronauts. BAGLEY: So what we do is that we extract these little discs of microalgae, and then eventually we get a lot of it.  STRICKLAND: Mm-hmm. BAGLEY: And then this smells terrible and it doesn't taste great, but it's very nutritious. So what we do is that to hide the flavor, we actually mix it with a lot of different types of ingredients here. You are in a Silicon bag and then you mix it up.  STRICKLAND: OK.  BAGLEY: And then it ends up as balls like this. And you can keep these for, you know, two or three days, and they'll still taste pretty fresh. STRICKLAND: I feel like I'm going to have a special meal. I'm excited. BAGLEY: There you go. Astronaut food. It's the future. STRICKLAND: Here's the space food.  BAGLEY: Still better, right?  STRICKLAND: It tastes really good. You got the peanut butter. BAGLEY: Mm-hmm. STRICKLAND: And oats. It's really nice texture.  BAGLEY: Mm-hmm. STRICKLAND: That's delicious.  BAGLEY: Great. STRICKLAND: I could absolutely -- I could eat this all the time.  BAGLEY: Mm-hmm. STRICKLAND: That's really good. (Voice-over): It's not just that Intrepid space fearing humans need food to stay alive. The preparation taste and appearance of food can have real psychological benefits for astronauts. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: And for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, a fur baby that created quite the brouhaha. Meet Chicken Cutlet also known as Chickie. This golden retriever, nearly nixed her owners nuptials a dream wedding in Italy when she chewed up a passport just before the trip.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey everyone, it's your boy Coy. Happy Thursday or as I like to say, happy Friday eve. We have a jam-packed show in only nine minutes and 52 more seconds to do it. So let's get to it.  We start today's show with a touchdown. India touching down on the moon on Wednesday with its crewless spacecraft, Chandrayaan-3. India's now just the fourth country to ever do it. It's a phenomenal feat that only the United States China and the former Soviet Union have pulled off as well.  Russia attempted this exact mission just this past weekend, but their craft crashed into the surface of the moon. This successful mission could cement India as one of our planet's superpowers in space. India's craft made a soft landing closer to the moon's south pole than any other spacecraft in history and scientists believe the moon south pole holds water deposits in the form of ice that could be converted into drinking water for astronauts, or maybe even rocket fuel. So there's a possibility that the moon south pole could become a place where future crude missions could stock up and travel farther into space.  The 2024 presidential election season is here. U.S. candidates run for president every four years. So Americans will head to the polls to cast their vote for president in November of 2024. But a lot has to happen before that like introducing Americans to the candidates and giving those candidates a chance to make the case for why they should have the job.  One of the most important tasks before Americans cast a vote for president is to determine who the candidates will be. That's determined through the primary elections. In most cases, the incumbent president, if they haven't already reached the two-year limit, they will represent their political party again. So in this case, current U.S. President Joe Biden will likely represent the Democratic Party come election time. He announced his bid for reelection back in April. With president Biden, as the presumptive nominee on the democratic side, much of the attention this go around will be on who will become the Republican challenger.  Beginning in January candidates from the Republican party will compete against each other in a primary election to determine who will hold the nomination. But every state conducts their own primary election and they don't all do it the same. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: America politics is dominated by two parties, Republicans, and Democrats. That means only two people have any real chance in the presidential election every four years. If you want to help decide who those two candidates are, the primaries are your best chance. It used to be that presidential candidates were selected at party conventions. It was mostly party members who selected delegates, who went on a convention to vote. Conventions still happen, but they're mostly ceremonial since primaries have determined every candidate for more than 50 years. Here's where it gets confusing, every state conducts their own primaries and none of them do it exactly the same. They're spread over the course of months in a presidential election here, which is why candidates set up camp in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. If a candidate banks on Iowa and doesn't win there, they might have to drop out. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Democrat Martin O'Malley suspending his campaign tonight. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A surprising finish in New Hampshire can make a candidate blow up on the other hand and give them new momentum. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Tonight, we sure show them what a comeback looks like. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Some states like Iowa have caucuses, which are more like neighborhood meetings than a traditional primary. People show up and actually lobby for their candidates. Some states have opened primaries, meaning anyone can take part in the primary, even if they aren't registered party members. Other states have closed primaries, meaning you have to join the party in order to vote. And some states like California are experimenting with completely nonpartisan primaries. Although not at the presidential level. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  In a way, the 2024 U.S. presidential election season kicked off last night when the first Republican primary debate was held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This was the first major stage for these hopefuls to speak about their ideas and policies and a chance for them to make the case as to why they should become the next president.  There were eight candidates that qualified and attended last night's a debate, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former Vice President Mike Pence, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson. Former president Donald Trump did not attend. And instead released a pre-recorded interview.  You can head to cnn.com for highlights from the debate and to learn more about the candidates.  Ten second trivia. When great white sharks are born, they are known as what? Calves, Pups, Hatchlings, or Whelps? Raise your hand if you said pups. Did you know that from the moment they're born, great white pups are all on their own. This summer swimmers at beaches across America are on the lookout for sharks. With more sharks found along the warmer shores on long island, New York State Park Police, they're deploying an army of drones to monitor them and to help prevent attacks. Police gave CNN's Clare Duffy, a hands-on demonstration at Jones beach in Long Island to see how these drones can help keep swimmers safe. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CPT. RISHI BASDEO, NEW YORK STATE PARK POLICE:  I can't predict to say whether or not there's going to be more bites of shark attacks, but what I could tell you is that because of the use of drones, the more drones that are flying in the air, there's the more of a chance of seeing these animals in their natural habitat. CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER (voice-over):  This summer shark attacks here on long island have prompted a heightened sense of urgency to keep sharks and swimmers distant from one another. Now to New York where this drone footage shows about 50 sharks swimming near the beach of a state park in Long Island That's where drones like the one that spotted 50 sharks at one beach come in. BASDEO:  It has really evolved from search and rescue to now looking for dangerous Marine wildlife. DUFFY:  Here at Jones beach, New York State park police gave CNN a demonstration of how its drone program is helping to spot sharks before potential attacks. BASDEO:  Now you're getting with the drawing a real Supreme aerial view of what's going on in real time on the waterway. DUFFY:  The Park Police operates a fleet of 19 drones used by officers here in the mobile command center, as well as lifeguards. BASDEO:  This mobile command center that you see behind us can live stream the videos that the drone is looking at in real time and bringing it back to some of our police officers. So they can communicate directly with the lifeguards and warn people into water early so they can move out of the water of the way of the sharks. DUFFY:  While shark attacks remain relatively rare, sharks are becoming more common on Long Island as warmer waters in recent years attract more fish and with more fish come more predators.  (On camera): So this is the kind of drone that the lifeguards are using? BASDEO:  This is exactly what the lifeguards are using.  DUFFY:  And this is the one that you said is around 6,000? BASDEO:  Correct, ma'am. So this bundle case right here is about $6,000.  This is the New York State Park Police. DUFFY:  Monitoring for sharks isn't the only thing these drones can do. The drone pilots can also equip them with speakers to communicate with swimmers who might be lost or disoriented. They can even deploy life saving devices to swimmers before lifeguards could get to them. BASDEO:  Let's put the cost value here. It's actually cheaper than calling in a police helicopter, but I'm talking about a quick deployment, setting something up really quick to get a fast situational awareness of an incident that is on unfolding is invaluable. DUFFY:  I'm curious what the public reaction to this has been. I imagine seeing drones flying above you with sort of something to get used to, people might be hesitant about having cameras. What's the reaction been like? BASDEO:  For the most part, ma'am, it's positive. But also I understand the concern. We're on a strict guidelines when we operate and fly these drones, it is not used to surveil the public. It is used to keep them safe. It is used for that search and rescue component. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10, I guess you could say she's the cleanest giraffe on the planet because she is spotless. This rare baby giraffe was born without spots at a Tennessee zoo. And the zoo says that giraffe experts believe she's the only solid colored reticulated giraffe anywhere in the world. Born July 31st, she was already six feet tall, but she'll grow up to 16 to 18 feet. At that point, her neck alone will be six feet long, but interestingly we'll only have seven vertebrae just like us humans.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up lovely people. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, and it's finally Friday, Friyay. Almost time to unwind, to relax the mind as we creep into the weekend. But before we get there, let's keep seeking to finish this week strong.  It is hot out there, right? For a huge portion of the country right now. And chances are, you might be trying to keep it cool. Excessive heat warnings the most severe form of heat alert currently span 1100 miles and are impacting more than 20 states. Temperatures in some places are 20 degrees higher than normal this time of year. This week more than 65 million people will have experienced a temperature above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. And the heat is causing significant challenges.  Listen to this, tragically, nearly two dozen cattle died from excessive heat in Nebraska, and more than 100 residents from a nursing home in Kansas City had to be evacuated due to temperatures reaching 119 degrees. And one other thing to let you know, just how hot it's been in ice cream shop in Iowa had to shut down because the building couldn't stay cool enough to keep the ice cream frozen. The heat wave is especially remarkable for this already record-breaking summer. The scientific cause is called a heat dome, which is a strong area of high pressure that traps and intensifies hot air at the surface. And the heat is predicted to persist. So we may see even more heat records across central and Southern parts of the country.  The record high temperatures are even impacting students in classrooms. In Denver, Colorado, 16 elementary schools, and a middle school ended classes early due to the soaring temperatures. Milwaukee public schools were closed entirely. In other districts, outdoor activities have been postponed. And even in classrooms where air conditioning is working. Well, the schools have had to make accommodations to avoid subjecting students to sweltering bus rides to get there. Our meteorologist Ms. Allison Chinchar is here to break it all down for us. Ally, it is smoke and hot out there? ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  That's right, Coy. It has been a brutally hot week and it's all thanks to a heat dome. Now, essentially what we've had set up this week is a high-pressure system essentially parked over the central U.S. Now, normally we all know heat rises, but under high pressure, that's actually pushing that air back down towards the surface, essentially acting like a giant lid, trapping that heat, keeping all of it back closer to the surface. And what that does is it allows a lot of this same area under that high pressure to just be dealing with incredibly hot temperatures. And in some cases prolonged periods of time because that high pressure system simply doesn't move.  Now over this week, we've had over 400 locations break, record temperatures. Again, all the way from Texas up into Minnesota and back over towards the Atlantic side of states like Georgia and Florida. Now, we are still going to continue to see those heat records continue. A lot of excessive heat warnings and heat advisories still in effect for the day Friday. But I have some good news and that is cooler temperatures are on the way, especially across the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast once we get into the latter half of the weekend and into next week. WIRE:  Ten second trivia. R.U.R. was a play published in 1920, introducing the concept of what? Robots, Records, Radio or Radon? If you said robots, put your hands up. Rossum's Universal Robots was a check play about machines taking over.  The next time you have to do chores like taking out the trash or doing the dishes. What if you could have a robot do it for you? It sounds like science fiction. It sounds like the future, but the future is apparently near. The team at Austin-based robotics startup, Apptronik believes their human like droid helpers will soon become the norm. We caught up with them to find out what all they are capable of and the potential downsides. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ASHLEY STRICKLAND, CNN SPACE & SCIENCE REPORTER:  What is Apollo, exactly? JEFF CARDENAS, CEO & CO-FOUNDER, APPTRONIK:  Apollo is our latest humanoid robot. Sometimes you'll hear us called a general-purpose robot. This is something that is going to be your friend. You're going to rely on these things to do all the things you don't want to do. STRICKLAND:  So what are some of its capabilities? DR. NICK PAINE, CTO & CO-FOUNDER, APPTRONIK:  We've designed Apollo with roughly human morphology, human range of motion, the same height, the same weight as a human. CARDENAS:  We need to make robots much more versatile than what they are today. The reason that it's humanoid is because we've built the world for humans. We have a big labor shortage here in the U.S. So where Apollo's going to start is in warehouses. Like you kind of see here, it can lift about 55 pounds. It operates on about a four-hour battery and you can change the battery out so you can keep it running 22 hours a day is what we're targeting. STRICKLAND:  What would you say to people who are watching this? They see Apollo and they're worried. Apollo could take my job? CARDENAS:  If we compare humans with robots, then the robots can take the portion of the work that drives people out of those industries. So instead of you unloading trucks in the hot Texas sun, you're managing a fleet of robots that's unloading the trucks for you. And you're learning new skills that become applicable across a range of different industries, but where we hope it to ultimately go is one day versions of Apollo could be in your home or eventually on the Moon or Mars. STRICKLAND (voice-over):  To help with those cosmic aspirations, Apptronik has teamed up with NASA. SHAUN AZIMI, DEXTEROUS ROBOTICS TEAM LEADER, NASA JSC:  My hope and my dream is that we will have general purpose robots fielded in space within the next 10 years. STRICKLAND:  But the biggest obstacle right now combining and refining mobility and dexterity, the co-founders of Apptronik are no strangers to that. Having worked on NASA's Valkyrie robot a decade ago. AZIMI:  Valkyrie capable of extra manipulation and -- and walking, carrying items, opening doors, but there are limitations. For example, being able to move very quickly and precisely. We really need systems that have more than one skill that are flexible and adaptable.  STRICKLAND:  Apptronik isn't alone in the rush to build a humanoid robot. Tesla has a humanoid bot of its own. And Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics has Atlas. But Atlas relies on hydraulics for its movement. CARDENAS:  Hydraulics are very powerful, but it's not safe to be around. So our bet at Apptronik was that electric humanoids were going to be the future. So the first phase for us was to focus on performance of electric motors or actuators, and try to get them up to par with what you see with a lot of hydraulic systems. STRICKLAND (voice-over):  And they're aiming for this everyday robot to have an everyday price.  (On camera):  What would you say is the price point for Apollo? CARDENAS:  The goal is for it to be less than the price of your standard car. These have to be affordable. They have to be accessible. STRICKLAND:  What would you envision a future Apollo being capable of doing? PAINE:  The next step is to build a more hardened version of this that is really kind of designed for scale manufacturing. CARDENAS:  I think 20 years from now much like the computer, we're going to look back and think, how do we ever get by without the help of these machines? (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is creating quite the hoopla. A top basketball shooting coach named Chris Matthews traveled to Japan to take on a Japanese robot in a hoop shooting contest. Let's call it "Labot James." Get this the robot beat Matthews in the first challenge. Then they put a smaller hoop inside the rim to up the stakes. This time Matthews beat Labot.  Toyota engineers built this Yana's robot that can hoop a lot in 2017 and it's already broken Guinness world record for consecutive free throws by a humanoid robot, more than 2000 in a row.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, sunshine. It is time to rise up and fuel our minds. Great to be back after what was hopefully an awesome weekend. What was your favorite part? Message me @Coywire. Mine was meeting so many of you who came up to say hello, like Ellie, Lilly and Maddie representing Beacon Hill Middle School in Decatur, Georgia, rise up. Since Monday is mostly just a state of mind. Let's get our minds right and start this week off strong, shall we. Let's brush up on some history to start, 60 years ago today more than 250,000 people congregated at the Lincoln Memorial for the March on Washington for jobs and freedom. That's where civil rights leader, Martin Luther king Jr. gave his famous, "I have a Dream" speech, this speech and the movement from the 1960s pushed to advocate for equal civil and economic rights for African Americans.  It also called to end segregation, ensure fair wages and economic justice advocate for equal voting rights and education, among other things. It's one of the most famous days in history and historically credited with putting pressure on then President John F. Kennedy and his administration to initiate a federal civil rights bill in Congress. On Sunday, tens of thousands of people assembled at the same location to spread the message that the fight against racial inequality is not yet over. The event was a Testament to the enduring influence of the original March on Washington. And that MLK's legacy of pushing for civil rights is still relevant today.  Up next, CNN National Correspondent, Jason Carroll met with two men who were at the March on Washington 60 years ago today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do we want now? JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was a call for economic and racial equality, a call to action that brought more than 200,000 people to the National Mall in Washington, D.C., on August 28th, 60 years ago. A day best remembered for Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic "I Have a Dream" speech. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR., CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER: Now is the time to make real, the promises of democracy. CARROLL: Among the hundreds of thousands, two young activists who were filled with hope.  COURTLAND COX, CHAIRMAN, SNCC LEGACY PROJECT: I was all the way in the top.  CARROLL (On camera): All the way in the top, over to the left.  COX: Yeah, over to the left.  CARROLL (voice-over): Courtland Cox is now 82, but 60 years ago, he was a 22-year -old working for the Civil Rights Organization's SNCC, The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. COX: And what I remember is the platform is there in the mid-center.  CARROLL: Edward Flanagan was there too.  (On camera): Where were you?  EDWARD FLANAGAN, ATTENDED MARCH ON WASHINGTON IN 1963: I was sitting on the wall up top there by the entertainers.  CARROLL (voice-over): Flanagan is 80 now, but on the day of the march, he was a 20-year-old who had just finished his shift as a waiter. Like scores of others, he wanted to take a stand for civil rights.  FLANAGAN: I was very close to Joan Baez. OK, I was able to notice she was barefoot. And I had on a new pair of shoes.  CARROLL (on camera): She was barefoot? FLANAGAN: She was barefoot.  (MUSIC) CARROLL (voice-over): A march six decades ago now seen through the eyes of two different men who shared the same goal many did that day.  FLANAGAN: It was, in fact, a march for jobs and freedom.  COX: Our thought to today is that we succeeded in changing this country.  CARROLL: As a young organizer, Cox was responsible for arranging safe transportation for people making the trek from the south to Washington, D.C. He says there were challenges from top to bottom. Much had to be done in very little time.  (On camera): The challenge from the bottom was the logistics of getting people here. Over an eight-week period, I'm trying to get trailways buses. I'm trying to get greyhound buses. And the drivers are saying, look, it's dangerous bringing people to the south.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I've been here before. You're never been here before.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I've never been here before.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, that's very --  CARROLL (voice-over): This week, Flanagan brought his daughters back to the place history was made.  FLANAGAN: That's the fact where the entertainers were.  CARROLL: Cox prefers to stay away this time, saying his marching days are behind him. Both agree while much was accomplished that day, the work is not over.  FLANAGAN: We are still, well, in a much better place than we were in '63, not in the place where one would expect 60 years on.  COX: We succeeded in doing a number of things by what we did in the past, but we also know that we have to do much more for the future.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. In what country would you find? The engineering Marvel nickname, the world's greatest shortcut? China, Brazil, Panama, or South Africa? If you said Panama, put your hands up. The Panama canal saves about 8,000 nautical miles. When ships travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans to the east and west coast of the U.S.  Panama, a country in central America is having one of their driest seasons on record and vessels. Traveling through the Panama canal are in a bit of a conundrum. The Panama canal is a 50-mile waterway that was completed in 1914 to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and to decrease travel times for ships. It's very important for maritime trade and allows ships to avoid traveling all the way around south America.  But now use of the canal is in jeopardy because of lower water levels. That's being caused by a lack of rainfall this year, which is impacting the fresh water lakes nearby upon which the canal relies. The system uses at least 50 million gallons of water for each vessel that floats through. In response canal, authorities have imposed restrictions on things like daily traffic and how much each vessel can weigh. Just this week, they extended the restrictions for another 10 months while the direct impact to U.S., consumers, retailers and manufacturers seems to be minimal right now. The potential for more disruptions are growing. We'll continue to follow this story for you right here on CNN 10.  This summer beach goers have found hundreds of sea lion and dolphins washed up across the shores of Southern California. Some of the animals sick, some dying. And Marine life experts believe a harmful algae bloom is to blame. The algae is called pseudo-nitzschia and it produces a neurotoxin which can be poisonous to sea birds and fish, and can then travel all the way up to food chain, making larger animals like dolphins, sea lions, and even humans sick. CNN Correspondent, Stephanie Elam visited a marine animal care center to learn how they've been rescuing and caring for a sea lion with the goal of getting them back to the ocean. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A joyous moment months in the making, as two six sea lion now fully recovered, burst onto a Southern California beach slide into the sea and swim off to freedom. The journey back into open water for these two was long and uncertain, which made preparing for the release all the more rewarding.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everybody ready? ELAM: The sea lions were driven to nearby Cabrillo beach for their final release. Thanks to the heroic efforts of animal rescuers at the Marine Mammal Care Center. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm sorry, sweetheart. ELAM: Who have been treating more than 120 sea lions for domoic acid poisoning in recent months, some sea lines didn't survive despite being treated, poisoned by an extended toxic algal bloom along the Southern California coast, that spread from Santa Barbara to San Diego. JOHN WARNER, CEO, MARINE MAMMAL CARE CENTER: It was the worst for many reasons, the size, the scale, the scope of it, but also the toxicity of the algae. ELAM: CNN was there, the day rescuers found one of the two sea lion released this week. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She is having a small seizure. What we'll do is just be very gentle with her.  ELAM: She's now known as Sophie. Sophie gained 35 pounds while in the center's care. And that adds up to a lot of fish. The extreme crisis stretched the center's ability to care for so many six sea lion. Algal blooms occur in nature, but this year, the high levels of toxins led to record poisoning. This one, growing stronger alongside his mother every day is now able to participate in puppy playtime, socializing with other baby sea lions until the pups and their mothers are able to be released as well and join the first two ready, willing, and finally able to return to the sea. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is really measuring up to be a good one. We're talking, measuring all sorts of critters like penguins and parrots, all being weighed and measured by these zookeepers at a London Zoo. Imagine having that job where you have to figure out how am I going to get this critter to stay on the scale.  Now every year, the zoo measures and weighs thousands of animals like this cute little monkey and holy moly, even spiders. Keep that thing away from me. They're going to record these important statistics that can also help to measure their health and wellbeing.  All right, I have a Monday motivation challenge for you. Try saying the alphabet backwards as fast as you can. Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T, S, R, Q, P, O, N, M, L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A, like that.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, what's up sunshine. It's your boy Coy, wishing you a wonderful Wednesday full of wonder. Halfway through the week. So let's lock in and aim to be just a little better today than we were yesterday.  It's time now for the best 10 minutes in news. We start today by traveling to the isolated nation of North Korea. The country announced this week that they're reopening their borders to some for the first time since the COVID era shutdowns. They are considered one of the last countries on the planet to do so. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is considered one of the most secretive countries in the world.  During the pandemic, the government imposed extreme measures to close its borders and tightly restrict travel even within the country. They also restricted the distribution of food and other products. According to the organization Human Rights Watch, COVID-19 further isolated the country as the government maintain tight control over its people. The news that North Korea will ease these border controls comes months after most other Asian countries relaxed the last of their COVID era restrictions. This includes China, which was known for its zero COVID policy, and unlike other countries, North Korea will still require its citizens to do a one-week quarantine.  On Tuesday, a flight from North Korea landed in China the first time since 2020. And flights between North Korea and Russia are also set to resume. CNN International Correspondent Paula Hancocks has more on what the reopening in North Korea might look like. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): North Korea's athletes are back on the global stage. Its taekwondo team headlined at the opening ceremony of the World Championships in Kazakhstan last week, believed to be the first overseas sporting engagement since its borders reopened.  This week, Pyongyang confirmed its borders are reopening to allow citizens stranded outside the country for more than three and a half years to return. It is considered one of the last countries to reopen its borders, and even then, they're only opening a crack with some international flights resuming with China and Russia. Tourism, though, is still a dream. Koryo Tours which specializes in taking Westerners into North Korea, since they've heard nothing beyond plans to repatriate its own citizens. SIMON COCKEREL, GM KORYO TOURS: All kinds of people essentially marooned outside of their country, with in most cases no way to contact family for three and a half years. HANCOCKS: Bart Van Genugten went on a tour of North Korea with his father one year before the borders closed. He created YouTube videos of his experience.  BART VAN GENUGTEN, YOUTUBER: You go and everyone hopes maybe that they will see a bit more of the real North Korea which won't happen. Like they show you the place that they're going to show you and it's the best of the best. HANCOCKS: He does see value in North Korean seeing foreigners in their country but acknowledges useful interactions with the people are rare. Western tour operators already a niche market are likely to be among the last to be invited value.  (On camera): One other group waiting to be allowed back in diplomats. The vast majority of them left during the pandemic unable to send supplies in or rotate staff out. And so far only Russian and Chinese officials have been invited back to Pyongyang since the restrictions eased showing Kim Jong-un's political priorities. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next an update on Hurricane Idalia which has been making its way through the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida. At the time, we recorded our show Hurricane Idalia was expected to intensify before hitting Florida's Gulf Coast. The storm is predicted to hit the coast of Florida early Wednesday at Category 3 strength and will come with powerful winds and life-threatening storm surge. Idalia's storm track is especially interesting because it's the first major hurricane in at least 172 years to head toward Apalachee Bay in the Big Bend region of Florida. It's a marshy coastal area, and though it's not densely populated, it is home to all sorts of wildlife and nature areas.  Another concerning aspect of this storm is that over the summer water temperatures around Southern Florida climbed to 100 degrees and temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico overall have hit record temperatures. Warm waters tend to act almost like fuel for hurricanes and Idalia could strengthen as it approaches.  Preparations for the storm have been underway. People in at least 22 counties along the Gulf Coast were told to evacuate their homes, air and train travel have halted across the state. In 42 districts, schools have closed. And the governor of Florida Ron DeSantis, had declared a state of emergency in 67 counties when we recorded our show. The National Guard was also activated to assist with storm response. We'll keep you updated over the next few days. Our Meteorologist Jennifer Gray has more on what you need to know about hurricanes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JENNIFER GRAY, CNN METEOROLOGIST: You have tropical depressions, tropical storms, and once it is strong enough to become a hurricane, you have five categories of category five being the strongest.  The state's most frequently hit by a hurricane Florida, Louisiana and Texas. But as much as we know about hurricanes forecasting them is still a challenge. Just as we name each storm, each storm has its own personality, like Katrina in 2005, which intensified rapidly overnight going from a Category 3 to a Category 5, it became the fourth most intense hurricane on record as of that time. And the forecast track can change dramatically, like Erika and 2015, or a system that can be viewed as relatively weak like a tropical storm could end up like Tropical Storm Allison in 2001. The remnants of the storm stalled over Southeast Texas dumping 35 inches of rain over Houston in just five days. The storm became the first non-  hurricane to have its name retired. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  10 Second trivia. What is the popular term for the second full moon in a calendar month?  Red moon, Blood moon, Blue moon or Harvest moon? WIRE:  Blue Moon crew put your hands up, the phrase once in a blue moon can refer to the second full moon in a month.  If you look to the sky tonight, there's a chance you might see that once in a blue moon opportunity, but tonight will be an even rarer treat. It'll be a super blue moon, a rare combination of a super moon and a blue moon. These are complicated terms, so let's take tend to break it all down. Super moons happen when the moon is full and located at or near its closest point to Earth. They happen three to four times a year. And a blue moon the second full moon in a month happens every two to three years. According to NASA, this combination, a super blue moon is very rare.  The next one won't happen until the year 2037. But don't fulminate against me if the moon isn't actually blue tonight. Despite what the name might suggest a super blue moon isn't actually super blue. It is super bright though compared to normal full moons, super blue moons appear 16% brighter and 14% bigger. And that's because they're slightly closer to Earth.  Thanks to the UIL team at Alvarado High School in Texas. You submitted the winner for #YourWordWednesday. Fulminate, a verb meaning to express intense protest. Well done. Something very different was found in the ocean in Wildwood, New Jersey. Frank Bolger was spending time at the beach with his wife and granddaughter when he spotted a message in a bottle. He took it home, opened it to find a note saying the bottle had traveled all the way from Ireland. The note was written back in 2019. So it took four years to travel across the Atlantic Ocean, but it was signed with just one first name. Now Frank Bolger is on a mission to connect with the writer and his story is making its way all over the world through the power of social media.  Today, we want to give a special shout out to Ojeda Middle School in Austin, Texas, rise up. Thanks for subscribing and commenting on our YouTube channel with your shout out request.  By the way, who's up for a challenge. Our CNN 10 YouTube channel was closing in on 750,000 subscribers. My producer said if we make it to 800,000 I can start shouting out to schools at the end of every episode, doubling your chances of getting one. If we hit 900,000 we're going to do three. And if we get to a million, we'll give a super shout out more on that to come.  But that's not all, every time we crossed one of those milestones, I have to be the subject, my producer says, of the 10 out of 10 in the form of some sort of video challenge voted on by you. Better not be a dunk tank. I'll see you tomorrow, everyone. Thanks for being the absolute best audience in news. END230831

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up sunshine, Happy Friday Eve. It's Thursday, August 31st, a great day to be brave, to be better, to believe. And most importantly, be you to full.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start with the latest on Hurricane Idalia. The powerful storm made landfall in Florida yesterday with heavy rain and winds of 110 miles per hour. It's the strongest hurricane in at least 125 years to hit Florida's big bend region of the Gulf coast. This was the state's third hurricane in the past 12 months.  Right before it made landfall, Idalia experienced what's called an extreme, rapid intensification. That's when winds increased by more than 35 miles per hour, within a 24-hour span, scientists say that's becoming more and more common due to warm water temperatures.  Idalia jumped from a Category 1 to a Category 4, the second highest rating on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. It then dropped back to a Category 3 before hitting land. It pushed water onto shore in a record setting storm surge. It also cut off power to hundreds of thousands of people. And checked this out, pilots caught this rare footage while evacuating an air base ahead of the storm. That's not lightning. It's an uncommon weather event, an electrical phenomenon known as St. Elmo's fire.  After the fast-moving storm passed through the recovery and cleanup effort began right away. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  We are in Pinellas County, just on the other side of Tampa Bay, where there -- there's still some flooding concerns for a part of the city. The mayor tells me that they're still waiting for some of this water to recede, so that officials get a better, a clearer picture of the kind of damage that they're dealing with here.  Jerry, if you can show them just up the street from where we are here along the coastline. You can see, one emergency crews out here on a pickup truck. They've been driving up and down a little bit further up the street out here were told some streets up there are pretty blocked off cars really can't get in and out of that area.  We are in Gulfport, again, a part of Pinellas County where we expected a lot of this storm search to take hold. It's what -- it was the one thing really that emergency officials across the Tampa bay area and Pinellas County were really worried about. They didn't want folks to be out here doing exactly what they're doing at least earlier in the day, because we still were going to have all of this water coming in off -- off the coastline out here. We've had a little bit of rain, although much of that has since cleared.  And so officials really were just telling folks really stay home, stay away from this part of town because we're still dealing with some significant flooding. The mayor tells me that a lot of the damage again does seem to have been, more storm surge related than anything else. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten Second Trivia. Leonids, Perseids, and Quadrantids are all names of what? Constellations, Animal orders, Meteor showers or Fields of mathematics? Shower me with a show of hands if you set meteor showers. These types occur in different parts of the year. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD MYERS, CNN WEATHER CORRESPONDENT:  This fireball lit up the Colorado night sky, as it traveled over the Western U.S. Sidings were also reported in Nebraska, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. NASA media watch field of reports of loud booms and shaking in the area caused by shockwaves as the media disintegrated. They estimate the fireball hurdle through the sky at approximately 41,000 miles per hour, traveling 48 miles in four seconds before it crumbled above the Keystone forest. We get questions here all the time about comets asteroids and meteors, meteorites. What's the difference? Well, let's start in space and work our way all the way down to the surface.  A comet is a snowball. It's a piece of ice. Now, the ice is mainly frozen gas, not water. But there could be dust and rocks and things inside the comet. Halley's Comet, now NASA knows of about 3,600 other comets than that one out there. Closer in, in the asteroid belt. These are rocks, not gas. They could be metal as well, but they are hard surfaces. And sometimes they come out of the asteroid belt, get closer to the surface of the earth, or at least our atmosphere.  If one or a piece of a smaller one called a meteoroid, hits the surface of the atmosphere, it turns into a meteor. It gets bright because it hits our atmosphere and begins to burn up. If it doesn't make its way all the way down to the surface, it turns into a shooting star.  Now, if it does make its way all the way down to the surface of the earth and hits the ground, and you can pick it up, that is a meteorite. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Have you ever heard of urban heat islands? If you live in a big city, you know how hot it can get in the summer, especially with all that heat radiating up off the concrete and asphalt, that's called the urban heat island effect. And it was first documented way back in the 1800 by a meteorologist in London. Today, we have tools that can help us identify and map these islands, which can be 18 degrees hotter than the areas around them. And that's important. So these hot spots can be cooled down. And that's exactly what the architects in our next story are trying to do. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KEENAN GIBBONS, LECTURER UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN:  In one study at the city had temperatures over 150, 160 degrees. We're cooking vast swabs of our city well done every single day. Why are we accepting so little? Why are the people here tolerating this? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our cities are hot by design, but they don't have to be that way. Architects Keenan Gibbons and Salvador Lindquist are uncovering exactly how we're cooking our cities using specialized tools like this drone. GIBBONS:  I have snap pictures in parallel. So I get a standard photo and then you get an identical thermal one at the exact same time. And it's opened up a whole world that just didn't exist previously. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our cities are hotter than surrounding rural areas. Sometimes 15 to 20 degrees hotter in extreme cases. SALVADOR LINDQUIST, UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA-LINCOLN:  Heat is amplified due to the different types of materials that you would commonly find in the city, asphalt, concrete, reflective building services. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is the urban heat island effect, governments and organizations use satellites to measure heat distribution on a regional scale. LINDQUIST:  The problem with that is that satellites can only understand heat at a 30 meter by 30-meter resolution. We're trying to find ways to understand the really highly localized impacts of heat. GIBBONS:  And the drone gets you right in there. I mean, you'd know that pavement was hot, but how hot? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The drone moves in an automated precalculated path. GIBBONS:  It's similar to, if you're a hockey fan, like a Zamboni machine. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And takes tons of photos of a street scape. GIBBONS:  About 2400, 2200 photos.  LINDQUIST:  Allowing for 3D modeling in thermal comparison.  GIBBONS:  It shows this area because it captures an intersection in any city USA. And so this is the urban heat island material palette. The air temperature on this day was 84 degrees Fahrenheit. Shaded concrete was 89, exposed concrete 110 degrees Fahrenheit. So we're jumping 20 degrees. LINDQUIST:  The full 30 degrees difference from the surface of the parking lot to the shade immediately behind me. GIBBONS:  But Bitumen Rooftops are measuring upwards of 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Beef is considered cooked well done at 160 degrees. LINDQUIST:  Heat is the leading cause of natural disaster related deaths in the United States and likely the world. GIBBONS:  We can build a model from this detailed map and then provide appropriate treatment options, you know, going forward. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Keenan and Sal hope other architecture firms, companies, and even cities use this toolkit in the future who can then fight the urban heat island effect with vast tree coverage, lighter pavement and white, or even green roofs. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Some cities have trouble mowing grass and hard to reach places, but America's goat talent have no fear. Your eco-friendly grazers are here. The city of Chicago goated these goats after they spent two weeks filling up on grassoline, clearing seven acres of hard-to-reach vegetation around power lines. The city's celebrated by giving them a driving tour around Chicago. These munching mowers are the greatest of all time helping to prevent outages caused by overgrown power lines since 2019, not bad, not bad at all.  And some of the other greatest of all time, the students and teachers at Lewis and Clark Middle School in Meridian, Idaho. You get the shout out today. Make the most of your moments today.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. We made it to Friday. The weekend is upon us. Anyone have some big plans this weekend? Message me @coywire on Insta, Snapchat, and Twitter and TikTok. I'd love to hear about it. We have a pack show today, the best 10 minutes in news, let's get to it.  We're going to switch things up today a bit though. Pop quiz hotshot.  Which of these cities will host the 2024 Summer Olympics?  Paris, France, Milan, Italy, Los Angeles, California, or Brisbane, Australia? All of these are future Olympic sites, but the next summer games will be in Paris.  They are less than a year away, the Summer Olympic and Paralympic games and just as the world's best athletes are ramping up their training, Parisians are having to ramp up their preparations to welcome millions of people from all over the world.  Let's break the upcoming games down by the numbers. Paris has 10 million tickets available for the Olympics. There are 329 medal events in 32 different sports across 18 days of competition. Paris tourism says there will be more than a quarter of a million rooms available during the games for accommodations. And they're predicting that up to 15.9 million people could visit the region next summer. But Paris is over 2000 years old. So that city has some really old bones. It's an added challenge, not just regarding infrastructure, but also the transportation system. CNN's Jim Bittermann has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  With less than a year ago before Paris hosts the next Summer Olympics, officials have been showing off how much work has been done with President Emmanuel Macron, having promised 1.5 billion euros, to ensure the accessibility of the competition to athletes, visitors, and tours. But accessible is a word scoff at by some disabled like Franck Maille, go for a tour with Maille, a Paralympic winner himself on Paris's most accessible public transport systems. And you see the problems which face the 350,000 disabled visitors expected to attend next year's games.  When Maille comes into the city, for instance, he uses a renovated train line equipped with elevators, making it accessible, but he points out not accessible without help. And while there are elevators, there's sometimes hard to find or not functioning, as a disabled British visitor found out. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  All of the lists were broken every single one. BITTERMANN:  And if the most modern subway line has problems, the 13 other older lines of the famous Paris Metro are simply impossible for disabled users.  (On camera):  While the Metro system is no doubt, the most efficient way to get around Paris, it was built more than a hundred years ago, and most of the stations are like this one, not accessible to anyone who can't go up and downstairs.  The Metro system is gradually making improvements. Officials don't believe that more than 14% of it will be wheelchair accessible by 2024 in the Olympic games. Just by comparison, Tokyo system was 90% accessible for the last Olympic games. Even the mayor of Paris admits there are problems. ANNE HIDALGO, MAYOR OF PARIS (through translator):  The Metro, which is very ancient cannot be made totally accessible. BITTERMANN:  But the mayor quickly pivots to the brand-new tramways built a ground level, which shouldn't be a problem for those in wheelchairs. And she points out the buses, which are being renovated and equipped with ramps, but the disabled who actually use the buses say, it's not that simple. FRANCK MAILLE, APF FRANCE HANDICAP:  Because for example, sometimes the extendable ramp doesn't work or the drivers don't know how to use them. BITTERMANN:  While the mobility issue remains a priority, there are others, housing for instance, the tens of thousands of hotel rooms and short-term apartment rentals in the city's historic buildings, only a tiny fraction are fully usable by people in wheelchairs. And there is the further question of access to the bar of the bathrooms in small businesses. There are part of the Paris scene. Despite the challenges Maille is still a big supporter of next year's games. MAILLE:  What I say to people is come, come to see Paris. That's clear, you know, but don't be surprised that Paris is not more accessible. That it's not the best of the best because there's still so much work to be done. BITTERMANN:  And other disability rights activists were hoping the games could transform, not just infrastructure, but also attitudes toward the disabled. Yet with less than a year ago before the games they say that looks increasingly doubtful. Jim Bittermann, CNN Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Look out, a record-breaking moment in sports, the biggest crowd ever at a women's sporting event in the entire world.  On Wednesday, women's volleyball in Lincoln, Nebraska are whopping 92,003 fans filled Memorial Stadium at the University of Nebraska's campus, fans filing in to watch the five-time NCAA champs as they took on and beat Omaha 3-0.

S. PETREE:  Yeah. ALEX SCHOOLEY, RACER:  I had fun.  MOOS:  Alex Schooley and Sydney Petree are best friends. Sydney is the daughter of the race track's marketing director. The two, four-year-olds rock they're warm up and then held hands as the race got underway. NATHAN SCHOOLEY, RACER'S DAD:  To watch those two little T-Rex start to waddle, um, they were trying to run, but it was more of a waddle. MOOS:  Sydney kept chewing on a toy T-Rex. W. PETREE:  We're got to do the interview first. We got to do the interview. MOOS:  Their 100-yard dash was immortalized. N. SCHOOLEY:  Or we're about to frame it. Careful, Alex. MOOS:  The two stragglers finally crossed the finish line. Alex, just a few feet ahead of Sydney. W. PETREE:  Definitely an amazing best friend moment. MOOS:  And don't you dare bring up losing that word is extinct in Sydney, the T-Rex's lexicon. W. PETREE:  First thing she said to me, when she crossed finish lines was dad. We won. We won. MOOS:  Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Tiny arms, big dreams, and an awesome attitude.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: What's up, lovely people? Hope you had an awesome three-day weekend and a great slabor day, aka, Labor Day, the federal holiday traditionally considered the official end of summer. And it's a day that honors and recognizes U.S. workers' contributions and achievements.  Now it's time for us to put in that work right here on CNN 10.  First up, thousands of people were trapped at the Burning Man festival. The enormous week long desert campout festival is set to focus on art, community and self-expression. It's held annually in a remote location called Back Rock City, a temporary community about 100 miles north of Reno, Nevada, an event already known for testing attendees' self-reliance took on a whole new meaning this week when more than 70,000 people were left stranded due to harsh conditions in the desert, the event was essentially shut down and attendees were told to shelter in place and conserve supplies.  The area received two to three months of rain in just a 24 hour span. And the conditions created this impossible terrain for festival-goers to navigate. CNN national correspondent Camila Bernal has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The decades-old gathering in the Black Rock desert is no stranger to extreme heat, but rarely like this. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're sinking. I think barefoot's the way to go. BERNAL: Two to three months worth of rain falling in just 24 hours, turning the desert ground into thick cement like paste.  Festival-goer Dean Zeller from Santa Monica, California, shot this video with his ankle deep into the mud. And from the air, you can see the standing water, muddy roads and countless RVs, vans, trucks, and other vehicles parked and helpless. ANDREW HYDE, STRANDED AT BURNING MAN FESTIVAL: When it was really wet, you couldn't do anything. You just lived here. There's really no way to walk miles, you know, to get out of it.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We couldn't leave, like we were stuck. Basically people couldn't could barely walk, let alone ride their bikes or drive out of here. And so that started getting a little scary. BERNAL: Many of those who tried to drive away were stuck. The situation so concerning that even President Joe Biden was briefed on the matter.  While organizers have often described the festival as a self-expression event where harshness meets creativity, few expected it to be this bad. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: But why? How did just 0.8 inches of rain lead to tens of thousands of festival goers getting trapped?  Our CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam will break down the science to help us understand why this became such a sticky situation. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: What you're looking at here with our 3d visualization tool is the difference between desert top soil and our earthy top soil that you and I might use to plant our vegetables in our garden, for instance. So we call that loam right, and water, as it rains, easily absorbs into that loam or that earthy top soil.  But when you're talking about rain, that continuously falls within the desert, it doesn't take much to start pooling up and then mixing in with that clay, creating that very muddy cement like mixture that ultimately costs so many thousands of people to get stuck and stranded in the desert of Nevada.  I mean, just take a look at some of these visuals, the -- aerial visuals really speak for themselves. I mean, look at these cars, you can see the muddy tracks and you can see completely abandoned vehicles because they simply cannot drive. It is too thick. It is too difficult to navigate that type of cement, like mixture that is a combination of the water, not absorbing back into the ground.  We call that in impermeable surface and the simply the amount of rain that fell in such a short period of time. Here's the radar. And, you can see there are no flood watches in effect for the BlackRock basin. This is known as a playa. In fact, we're going to dry things out rather quickly here over the next 24 hours.  So as soon as we get the sun to rise this morning, we'll get that typical evaporation that would happen within this playa that you see, just north of empire, that shading of white, that is a dry basin across the desert. And, it normally evaporates the water when we get that break in the rain, but that simply didn't happen because the rain continuously fell over the same areas for a period of time on Friday and Saturday. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Ten second trivia:  The International Space Station and many other satellites orbit within what layer of the Earth's atmosphere?  Troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, or thermosphere? Thermospherians, put your hands up. This layer extending from about 53 to 375 miles above Earth is home to the ISS. Outside of this past weekend's college football season openers, on Monday, we had a different type of touchdown -- four astronauts returning from space. After a six-month stay on the International Space Station, members of the crew six mission aboard the SpaceX crew dragon capsule actually made splashdown when they landed off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida.  The astronaut's mission was run as a joint operation between NASA and SpaceX and they were coming in hot. Literally, the spacecraft traveled at a speed of more than 17,000 miles per hour on its way back to earth and the exterior of the capsule heated to about 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit. I'm sorry, what, wouldn't I be burning up inside? Good question.  Yes, the crew was protected at a comfortable temperature. Well, below 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Next up, a project that I am pumped to share with you. This Friday, at 9:00 Eastern on CNN, I have an hour-long documentary coming out. It's on "THE WHOLE STORY WITH ANDERSON COOPER" and it's called "Hard Hits: Can Football Be Safe?" I played nine years in the NFL. I have a titanium plate and four screws in my neck, so I know how dangerous the game can be, but I was blown away learning about the technology and innovation being used to make the game safer now and for future generations. Could advancements in the game one day help keep players safer by predicting injuries before they happen?  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Can your data potentially predict when a player might get an injured? CHRISTINA MACK, EPIDEMIOLOGIST: Absolutely. That's culture change. WIRE: Christina Mack is an engineer and epidemiologist. She presents data to the NFL's competition committee, the group that reviews league rules and any potential changes every year. MACK: You rank teams over five years where the Super Bowl trophies are. WIRE: Wow. MACK: It's a winning strategy. Your players are more available. They're performing where they want to be performing and they're not getting re-  injured. WIRE: That's just some of the NFL's big data crunching, from high tech body scanning that's being used at the NFL combine. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One, go. WIRE: To tracking body movements, to optimize performance, and detect imbalances that could potentially lead to injuries, to sensors on the bodies inside helmets and mouth guards.  Turn 'em into a video game. JEFF R. CRANDALL, BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEER: We're having you go through a set of drills where we've tracked all your motions. WIRE: That's biomechanical engineer and lab CEO, Jeff Crandall and his Biocore research team.  All right, I'm all sensored up. And the idea is that they will be able to see, am I favoring any part of my body? Are there any anomalies, imbalances? Stadiums in the league this year will have dozens of these cameras that will be able to track players' movements. That way, if there isn't injury on game day, they can go back and look at the data before that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bottom line is with all the information that's available to us, camera angles, or sensors or injury data, we're going to get to the place where we'll understand risk, and maybe someday be able to predict with some degree of certainty, which players are more likely to be injured than others. We can intervene before it happened.  CRANDALL: Go. WIRE: Ask for me, how did I do more than a dozen years after I left the NFL? CRANDALL: We see both knees and the left hip it's causing too much load to go through your knees.  WIRE: I didn't tell you anything on me that was bothering me, but each day when I wake up, neither knee feels great. And my left hip is off. CRANDALL: The good news is if we look at you over we've normed, all the players relative to the NFL population, you're right in the middle. So you've sort of still got it. WIRE: Still got it? CRANDALL: Still got it. WIRE: Okay. All right.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Go. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Our final story of the day is a little cheesy, actually very cheesy - - 80 workers in a tiny Mexican town of Pijijiapan breaking the Guinness World Record for world's largest string cheese ball. It weighs 1,230 pounds, and it took more than 1,500 gallons of milk to make this monster it's actually made out of Oaxaca cheese. The look on the people's faces is so sweet, I can't even bear it.  Well, I hate to be cheesy, but life's good to y'all, and today is actually National Cheese Pizza Day, and a lot of shops out there actually have some pretty good deals. So take advantage if that's your thing. All right. Our special shout-out today goes to North Hartford High School in Pylesville, Maryland. You have a pizza my heart.  I'm Coy Wire and I'll see you tomorrow. END230906

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello and happy Wednesday. It's #YourWordWednesday. Your vocabulary word on CNN 10. Follow me @coywire, put your word definition and school and a teacher in the comment section on my most recent post, and we'll choose a winner to work into tomorrow's show.  We start today with the latest news on North Korea. According to the U.S. government, Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea plans to travel to Russia, to meet president Vladimir Putin, for discussions on a potential deal to supply Moscow with weapons for its war on Ukraine. The warning came from the National Security Council, and they said that weapon negotiations between Russia and North Korea are actively advancing. But we don't have any information on when and exactly where a potential meeting between the leaders might take place.  The U.S. and its allies are concerned about the meeting specifically, the U.S. has increasing concerns over that with which North Korea could supply Russia in terms of military assistance for Russia's war effort in Ukraine. And experts are also concerned that in return, Russia could supply North Korea with technology that could be dangerous specifically technology that could advance North Korea's satellite and nuclear-powered submarine capabilities.  Just last month, North Korea made a second attempt to launch a spy satellite into orbit, though it failed. The Biden administration has routinely declassified intelligence about support that Russia is receiving, or is planning to receive in an effort to deter countries from providing support for their war effort. We'll head to so South Korea now to hear from CNN International Correspondent, Paula Hancocks. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The first and last meeting between the current leaders of Russia and North Korea was more than four years ago since then Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine and his military efforts are faltering. So for Kim Jong Un, the power dynamics have changed. DAVID SANGER, NY TIMES & CNN CONTRIBUTOR: A large power is now dependent on him. That hasn't happened in a while. Are the second thing he gains is the possibility of access to more oil. At the moment that Kim Jong Un is testing his ballistic missiles, particularly the long-range ones, many of which have design commonalities with Russian missiles, he can get a lot of help there. HANCOCKS: U.S. official believe Moscow could receive multiple types of munitions from Pyongyang in any arms deal, which could be used on the front lines in Ukraine. The Biden administration believes North Korea already delivered infantry rockets and missiles for use by Russian mercenary force Wagner last year. U.S. officials assess Kim Jong Un may travel to Russia to meet Vladimir Putin this month. There is an eastern economic forum in Vladivostok next week. Letters of support have been exchanged between the two leaders. Russia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was given the red-carpet treatment by Kim in Pyongyang in July. The North's military capabilities were on full display. And South Korea's intelligence agency says a second Russian delegation visited at the start of August. By August 8th, a Russian plane is believed to have transferred unknown military supplies from Pyongyang, no evidence or destination given. Pyongyang and Moscow deny any potential arms deal. CARL SCHUSTER, INSTRUCTOR, HAWAII PACIFIC UNIVERSITY: Kim is becoming more paranoid than normal over the last four or five years. And so for him this alliance achieves, makes him look less isolated, provides a psychological boost for him and his inner circle. HANCOCKS (on camera): Politically, both Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un stand to benefit greatly from a closer alliance. They are united by a common enemy, the United States, and they both want an alternative world order, a world where the U.S. is less powerful and where U.N. security council resolutions are less able to be imposed. Paula Hancocks, CNN Seoul. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  We've got new info that says pesky invasive species are causing a whopping 423 billion in damage every year in this world, an invasive species is defined as one that causes economic or environmental harm in an environment to which it is not native. And a new U.N. report says that human movement like travel or global trade is spreading these animals, plants, and other organisms in new regions at an unprecedented rate. The report says these alien troublemaker species are driving plant and animal extinctions contributing to food scarcity and making environmental disasters worse all around the planet. And get this, we're discovering about 200 new alien species every year and out of the 37,000 alien species that have been introduced all over the world, a whopping 3,500 of them are causing serious problems. They're ruining crops, wiping out native species in certain areas, polluting our water and spreading disease. It's hitting our wallets hard too. Scientists are saying the associated economic costs have been skyrocketing at least quadrupling every 10 years since 1970, the study hopes these findings will lead to more ideas and cooperation for prevention in the future.  Ten Second Trivia. In tennis, what term is used to describe a score of zero? Deuce, Nil, Love or Let? Show me some love with some hard hands if you said love. Historians, don't exactly know why, but love is the word use and tennis to denote no score.  The U.S. open is underway in New York city dating back to 1987. It's the fourth and final major or grand slam tennis tournament held each year. The others are the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon. Well, if you have cat light quickness and golden retriever light chasing skills, you might find yourself on the court with the biggest tennis stars in the world. CNN's very own Jon Sarlin has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JON SARLIN, CNN:  Tennis balls, for two weeks of the year, they're inescapable in Queens, New York on the grounds of the U.S. Open. But who collects all those balls? The stoic and hard running ball crew members chasing them down with the best standing view in the house. We decide to find out what it takes to become a member of the U.S. Open ball crew from Tiahnnee Noble, the head trainer. (On camera):  What makes a good ball crew member? TIAHNNEE NOBLE:  So its agility, definitely. We want to be fast out to that ball and get back. Um, we're attentive because we're obviously servicing the world's best tennis players. We want to have fast, flat and accurate roles and then teamwork. SARLIN:  I know there is this kind of intense tryout for the ball crew members. Would you be able to show me --  NOBLE:  Yeah, absolutely. We can get out.  SARLIN:  -- what that would entail? NOBLE:  Yeah, we can get out on court. So I'm going to bring Rachel in.  SARLIN:  OK. NOBLE:  She's going to help. She's part of the ball crew. SARLIN:  Hey Rachel.  RACHEL:  Hello. SARLIN:  Is it hard?  RACHEL:  It can be difficult, but it's a lot of fun.  SARLIN:  There are three things every crew member needs to master, retrieving the ball, rolling the ball and servicing the ball back to the player. First up, retrieving the ball.  NOBLE:  You ready? SARLIN:  OK. RACHEL:  Your responsibility is any ball that is hit into the net, run as fast as you can, pick up the ball with two hands and then return to your ready position. Second one coming. SARLIN:  The trickiest part, figuring out where to run after grabbing the ball. NOBLE:  Back, back, back, back. RACHEL:  Usually if it's before the central line, you're going to run back. But then if it's past that central line --  SARLIN:  You're going to keep going.  RACHEL:  You're going to keep going. Go all the way across. SARLIN:  Who's tough?  (Voice-over): Next, rolling the ball without bouncing it. NOBLE:  Instead of doing same foot, same arm, throw opposite so you can get down low.  That's it?  SARLIN:  Would you say the role is the hardest part?  RACHEL:  Yeah, I think so. Because a lot of time your adrenaline is pumping and then you still have to have a very accurate role. NOBLE:  I remember low to the ground, low to the ground. No, opposite, opposite.  SARLIN:  Have you ever rolled in the blue? RACHEL:  Occasionally by accident. SARLIN:  And finally servicing the ball back to the players, which not only requires ball skills, but some mind reading seems. NOBLE:  Go up as if you've got a player right there, ready to serve it. And you're going to send them two, maybe three, maybe four.  SARLIN:  And do they say that? NOBLE:  It's all like nonverbal cues, whether it's a head nod, whether it's a racket little movement and you want it just to be a nice task. So it's coming up around their waist height. You don't want too much air on it. SARLIN:  Just so maybe like a --  NOBLE:  Not as forceful. SARLIN:  There another put.  NOBLE:  There is. SARLIN:  Is that the kind of toss? NOBLE:  That's the kind of toss. They'll typically tap back. So you have to be attentive. Grab those two, then go back into position. SARLIN:  So you put me through the ringer.  NOBLE:  Yep.  SARLIN:  I got to ask you, how'd I do? NOBLE:  You did all right. There's a few things you can probably like learn and maybe come back next year. SARLIN:  Better luck next year? NOBLE:  Yes. Come back next year. SARLIN:  I'll take that. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  The most dominant competitive eater in the world has tasted defeat. Joey Chestnut goes down at the U.S. Chicken Wing Eating Championship on Sunday, Australian James Webb, setting a new world record at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, New York. He devoured 276 wings in just 12 minutes. That's about 23 each minute. Chestnut ate 36 fewer wings than Webb. But Joey says, he'll be back next year hungry for revenge. Orchard Park, New York, that's where the Buffalo bills play, where I played six of my nine NFL seasons and where I learned to shout out on some Buffalo wing, something fierce.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello and happy Friday Eve. It's Thursday, September 7th. And we have a jampacked show, but only 10 minutes to do it. So let's get right to it. Keeping you on your toes today. So pop quiz, hot shot. One of the richest countries in Africa, what nation's capital is Libreville? Ghana, Gabon, Senegal or Tanzania? Home to over 2 million people, the mostly French speaking country of Gabon is the answer here.  Let's learn a little bit about what's going on in Gabon now. The leader of Gabon's military General Brice Nguema was sworn in as interim president during a televise ceremony Monday. Last week, the General lead coup or military takeover that ousted President Ali Bongo. This takeover ended the previous family's power over many decades of rule over Gabon.  The previous leader was in power for 14 years and was recently declared the winner of a disputed presidential election. There were voting delays, internet cuts, and the administration did not allow coverage of the vote by foreign press.  After Bongo the previous ruler was ousted. He was placed on house arrest and the new group in power voided the election results and shut the country's borders. And this has since triggered global condemnation of the coup. Celebrations also breaking out across the tiny nation and thousands of supporters expressed solidarity with the military. There was even a military parade for General Nguema's inauguration.  No one knows how long Nguema will have power. He said the country will not rush into any new election. So as to avoid a "repeat of past mistakes." CNN Senior International Correspondent, David McKenzie has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALI BONGO ONDIMBA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF GABON:  I'm Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of Gabon. DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  An extraordinary plea for international help. The ousted president of Gabon, Ali Bongo, and the house arrest. ONDIMBA:  To tell, to make noise, to make noise for the people here have arrested me.  MCKENZIE:  The noise was not enough. On Monday, the new military leader sworn in. "I solemnly undertake on my honor to do my utmost to achieve national unity," says Gabon's Junta Leader.  MCKENZIE (on camera):  Is there a fear that there is contagion happening here? CAMERON HUDSON, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTL. STUDIES:  Well, I don't think it's a fear of contagion. There is contagion. MCKENZIE:  It's just the latest domino to fall. In just three years, a cascade of military takeovers spreading across west and now central Africa. Most of them form French colonies, but each with a specific cocktail of grievances over security, corruption, and a lack of opportunity. HUDSON:  This is a wave who has -- whose time has not yet crested. I think we're going to see several more of these in the coming months and years before we see a kind of return to what we thought was a normal state in the kind of post-cold war era. MCKENZIE (voice-over):  The condemnations have been universal. The impact minimum. African and Western powers face a dilemma in Niger, there is apparent popular support for the coup and deep anger towards France. Plans for a regional military intervention have stalled. French counter terror forces have withdrawn from two of the countries. Their position in Niger is tenuous at base. At Sahel, Niger for the U.S. multimillion dollar drone bases critical in fighting extremist groups. The state department is treading carefully. VEDANT PATEL, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON:  And continue to advocate for a diplomatic solution that respects the constitutional order in Niger.  MCKENZIE:  In Gabon, state media showed off bags of cash. They say they were found at the son of the president's home and at the home of another official. CNN couldn't independently verify these images. For more than 50 years, Omar Bongo and his son, Ali Bongo run as oil, rich nation, much of their wealth was kept in France. Most Gabonese young and old had only known the rule of the Bongo family and its cronies. CHRIS FOMUNYOH, NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTE:  So for them, the military coup in the short-term looks much better than anything that they've been living through. And one can understand that boost of immediate support and what the military and various missionary groups bring to the continent is less opportunities for freedom for democracy than more. MCKENZIE:  David McKenzie, CNN, Johannesburg.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And now let's talk about Venice, AKA, the floating city, which has so much rich history, art, architecture, and charm, that it can bring a sort of ebullience to many who visit.  If anyone you know is thinking about making the day trip to the floating city, listening to this. Starting in the spring of 2024, if you're not spending the night, you'll have to fork over five euros. That's about $5.40 to get into the city on super busy days. The city is making history as the first in the world to charge folks an entry fee.  This isn't a permanent thing. It's like a 30-day test run. And instead of doing it all in one month, they're picking days when they expect tons of visitors like holidays in the peak carnival season. The goal, to discourage day tourists during those crazy times.  So here's the deal. Venice can get seriously crowded. On some days, there are way more tourists than actual residents. They're still working out the official dates when the fee will apply.  But here's the scoop, for those who live there commute, own a second home, or are staying overnight, you're off the hook. You'll just have to register online for your visit. The money they collect from these entry fees in part will help cover the cost of this booking system.  And you know what, other European cities dealing with Hordes of day- trippers or keeping a close eye on this test, run in Venice. They're wondering if they too can pull off something similar to deal with the whole over tourism thing. Coming up, have you ever thought about how clean your place really is? I mean, even though it might look clean, what about those sneaky germs hiding where you can't really see them? Well, up next CNN's Clare Duffy decided to roll up her sleeves and get down and dirty testing the germs in her home.  And one more thing, I've always wondered, do we ever truly get rid of dirt and dust? Like if we wipe it up and toss it in the garbage or broom it away, it kind of just gets moved around, doesn't it? Anyways, let's see what nasties might be lurking beneath the surface of our spaces. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER:  I want to know, was I the dirtiest? PAUL DAWSON, PROFESSOR, CLEMSON UNIVERSITY:  It was a code. So we don't know who was who, but whoever's A, was the least contaminated. DUFFY:  Yes. (Voice-over):  We set out on an experiment guided by food scientist, Paul Dawson, to collect samples from the homes of our colleagues, family, and friends to find out which spot in our homes has the most germs. Across five homes, we tested the same spots. Four days after they were cleaned. The kitchen sink drain, the kitchen countertop, the bathroom toilet seat, the bathroom faucet handles and the front door entryway. The lab, isolated bacterial cells and documented them as they multiplied, growing into colonies that we can see.  (On camera):  This is really gross. I mean the front door one, especially, it just looks, I mean, it's covered, right? I was really worried about when you walk in the front door, that ground, because we live in New York City and the ground is dirty. DAWSON:  So you're really concerned about that. Maybe having a door mat that you can clean periodically. DUFFY:  Our non-scientific experiment confirmed decades of research microbes, including bacteria live all around us. We're familiar with the dangerous ones like salmonella, listeria and E. coli, plus viruses that we didn't test for. But not all germs are bad. In fact, most are just fine for us. And some help our bodies function.  (On camera):  The thing that surprises people most about the germs in their homes is? DAWSON: That the tallest seed is probably the cleanest place in their house. DUFFY:  So the places where we prepare our food, those were dirtier than the toilet seats.  DAWSON:  I would say yes, definitely. DUFFY:  The National Sanitation Foundation recommends using a weak bleach solution to sanitize kitchen drains and disposals once a month. For your sponge, try to replace it often. DAWSON:  Across the board, the sponges, very highly contaminated with bacteria and mold. DUFFY:  So in that sponge, I replace my sponge every week. So that sponge was only three days old. DAWSON:  Yeah, it's impossible to remove all the bacteria. They're going to be there no matter what. The point is, most bacteria are harmless, are positive. There's a few that aren't. That's where the sanitation would come in. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  The Danish Chamber Orchestra had some pretty unique performers at their recent gig. A canine choir was howling at the moon, putting on a rare show, featuring the hunting symphony, a piece composed by Leopold Mozart who happens to be Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's dad, did you know?  So here's the scoop, 10 dogs tried out for this gig, but only three made the cut, Cookie, Sophus, and Sica. These furry rock stars got picked because their barks sounded just about right. And they could handle the loud music and the loud crowd.  All right, we have a shout out to Mr. Mason, history teacher at Mio, in Mio, Michigan. Your Miley submitted the winner of #YourWordWednesday. Ebullience, a noun meaning the quality of being cheerful and full of energy. Well done. I'm Coy Wire and we'll see you tomorrow. END230908

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening. Wherever you are in this world. Go on and smell the flowers and cool the soup. It is Friday, baby. Let's finish this week strong and kick our weekend off right. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10 with the latest in political news. The U.S. presidential election is coming up next year. And several days ago, we covered the first Republican presidential primary debate and showed you the candidates that will be competing to become the next commander in chief. While a new CNN poll released yesterday shows how Americans are feeling about the likely democratic nominee, incumbent president Joe Biden and the direction of the country right now under current leadership. CNN Political Director, David Chalian discussed it on CNN this morning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR:  His approval rating is down at 39%, 61% of Americans disapprove. He's been hanging at that low point guys, for quite some time. We talk about the mood of the country, 14 months out from a -- from a presidential election, not that great. Three in 10 Americans, that's it, say things are going well in the country, 7 in 10 say things are going badly in the country. And 58% of Americans in this poll say that Joe Biden's policies have actually worsened economic conditions in the country, only 24% say they've improved economic conditions. This is why we hear him talking about Bidenonics every day. He's out and about in the country. PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  David, the President is the oldest president in history. He was this morning. He will be tomorrow. That's just the reality. And White House officials acknowledge that. Don't love talking about it, but have long made the case. That's not the kind of pervasive issue for voters. It's not going to be the determinant factor. What does this poll show?  CHALIAN:  Well, it's certainly on the mind of voters. We'll see how important it becomes, but it clearly is a major concern. We ask folks though, do you think, are you seriously concerned that Biden's age might negatively affect his ability to serve a full term? Three quarters of Americans are indeed seriously concerned. Three quarters of Americans don't agree on anything, but there's concern there. You see it here too seriously concerned about his current mental and physical competence being negatively impacted by his age and seriously concerned that his understanding of the next generation's concerns are impacted 68% say that and that -- and the economy, as we talked about that is what is behind these numbers.  Why Joe Biden is in a sort of dead heat margin of error race with nearly every Republican tested. Poppy noted that Nikki Haley is the exception to that. She's running outside the margin of error. But look at this Trump margin of error race, no clear leader. DeSantis, Pence, Scott, Ramaswamy, Christie, they are all with no clear leader.  And I just want to know guys, one other thing that is going to cause agita for the White House team is this motivation factor. Are you extremely motivated to vote in next year's presidential election? Look at this, Republicans and Republican leaning independents, have a 10-point advantage over Democrats on that score. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. In golf, finishing a hole in three shots Under par is called a what?  Birdie, Eagle, Bogey or Albatross? All of my Albatross bosses, put your hands up. Free under par for an albatross is extremely rare. One under par for birdie, two for Eagle.  Coming up next, we've got a golf course that four more than 50 years was perfectly manicured. Nice and neat. It was called the valley view golf club in Akron, Ohio. But in 2015, it shut down. And today a range of grasses and native flowers are driving a whole new course of action. Accrue chipping away at a major project in CNN's Call to earth. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIKE JOHNSON, CHIEF OF CONSERVATION, SUMMIT METRO PARKS:  You see there's these large flowers down there. There's some white ones, some pink ones. That's a native hibiscus. It's in the mallow family and the wetland ones. They call them Marsh Mallow, get it. Marsh Mallows, yeah.  My name is Mike Johnson. I'm the Chief of Conservation for Summit Metro Parks. We are at the valley view area of cascade valley Metro Park. Today, you would never know that this was ever a golf course. The vegetation that you see behind me, 90% of it is native. Whereas when this was a golf course, 90% of it was non-native and invasive. LISA KING, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SUMMIT METRO PARKS:  This park is right within the city of Akron limits. And when we started the acquisition, we realized how important it was to connect the other two parks to this area. It allowed us to knit together 1800 acres. That is something that's very difficult to do in a county where everything is beginning to be built out. JOHNSON:  The first choice we had to make is do we allow it to restore on its own, just kind of let it go, or do we take a more active role in that process? And because this was a golf course, we decided it was necessary to take a more active role.  We had to undo the golf course before we could restore the landscape. The next step was to establish a native cover of vegetation. And rather than plant trees. We decided to plant nuts. And over the course of a fall, our volunteers brought us a quarter million nuts. And over the course of two days, 600 volunteers showed up to plant, 120,000 of them.  This is the Cuyahoga River, and we're looking out over a vast restored flood plain. When we acquired the property, the banks of the river were steep. They'd been channelized, uh, the golf course, they wanted to keep the water out. We wanted to bring the water back into the landscape.  One of the biggest challenges of any park district is preserving our natural resources. And also at the same time, letting people come in and enjoy them. KING:  What we knew we needed to do was one more phase where we could bring access to the river for the public. So phase two is under construction now. JOHNSON:  These parks and the wetlands and the streams filter pollutants from the water that we eventually drink. They clean the air. They provide habitat for wildlife, including a large array of endangered species we have here in Summit County.  They're also important for people, these are places for people to come and relax to de-stress. They're important for recreation and connecting with nature for especially young people to connect with nature and inspire them to become the next generation of land stewards. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  The endless game foundation in north Kansas city just blew the roof off the record books. They went all out, playing in the longest baseball game, ever clocking in at a jaw dropping 100 hours and one minute of nonstop action. The old record was just over 83 hours. They played in shifts, subbing in and out. So nobody got too burned out, but it gets even better. During this epic five days showdown, the endless game foundation pulled in cash for not one, not two, but seven different charities. Talk about putting the fun in raising funds.  All right, I have to give two shout-outs today. One to my high school, Cedar Cliff High School in Camp Hill, PA, rise up. You'll see it. And even old video of this dude. That's 14-year-old me. You can apparently notice a difference, right?  My one-hour documentary airs on CNN and Sunday at 8:00 p.m. Eastern. And I have to shout out Mr. Pulsifer and his class at Indian Hills Middle School in Sandy, Utah. Y'all are so far. You make hot sauce melt. I wish you all an awesome weekend. I'm Coy Wire.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, lovely people. I'm Coy, hoping your weekend was wonderful and you're feeling refreshed and ready to rock this Monday. We have just 16 Mondays left in 2023, each one offering a new beginning and chance to shine. So let's make them count. Shall we?  We're going to start today in the North African nation of Morocco, a 6.8 magnitude, powerful earthquake shook Morocco's high Atlas mountain range shortly after 11:00 p.m. Local time on Friday. Rescuers in Morocco are still searching for survivors. Tragically, at the time of this recording, at least 2,000 people had lost their lives, 1,400 others in critical condition.  The worst damage and destruction has been in isolated mountain areas, which are difficult to access. Residents have described entire villages, suffering damage with rescuers, unable to reach those in need. Morocco's worst earthquake of modern times was in 1960 when at least 12,000 people died. But the scale of this weekend's quake and the impact is still becoming clear. More now from meteorologist Allison Chinchar, who has more on the details of the earthquake and its aftershocks. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: We know the original quake was a magnitude 6.8 at a depth of about 11 miles for geological standards that is considered extremely shallow.  Now, after that main quake, just 19 minutes after that, they had their first aftershock, a 4.9 magnitude, and 4.9 may not sound like that much, but after having the dad, the 6.8, keep in mind, you're going to have a lot of those buildings. A lot of the homes that are now structurally compromised. So even something like a 4.9 can cause subsequent damage, that was felt the original quake was felt as far away as neighboring countries of Algeria and Portugal.  But again, to show you how rare it is for this region to experience such large quakes, just since 1900, there have only been maybe a handful of quakes at a magnitude 5.0 or higher. So again, it's very rare in this area.  Now we had the original quake at a 6.8, one since aftershock of 4.9 we really don't know how long it's going to be before there could be another, would there be multiple in a row? Each earthquake is different, but on average, statistically speaking, there could be one an aftershock of at least a 5.8 and even say a 4.2, a 4.5, even though it's a much smaller number, it could still cause a tremendous amount of additional damage just because those buildings, especially the older ones have already been structurally compromised by the initial quake. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: All right, thank you, Allison. And more now on how this tragic earthquake is impacting the people of Morocco. Here's CNN Senior International Correspondent, Sam Kiley. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Marocco's King Mohammed has declared three days of national mourning here in Marrakesh and that is because his country has been completely devastated by an extraordinary earthquake totally unexpected in cities like this, Marrakesh.  This has been the scene here in the Medina, the most ancient part of this ancient city. Here a building clearly ripped away by this earthquake but the scenes have been even worse in the interior of the country where one woman who was trapped for some 12 hours was pulled from rubble in a remote village.  Now there are 13 people dead here in Marrakesh across the country more than 1300 people have died and the authorities here expect those numbers to climb with some rapidity. Their problem though is getting out into the areas that are worst affected.  The epicenter is about 45 miles south of Marrakesh but the areas that have been really badly devastated according to the local authorities have been villages in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: The people of Morocco will need assistance in the days, weeks and months to come, organizations are on the ground, responding to the disaster right now, and CNN's Impact Your World has ways to support relief efforts. For more information, about ways to help you can visit CNN's Impact Your World website. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This just in, you were looking at obviously a very disturbing live shot there. That is the world trade center. And we have unconfirmed reports this morning that a plane has crashed into one of the towers of the world trade center. CNN Center right now is just beginning to work on this story. Obviously calling our sources and trying to figure out exactly what happened, but clearly something relatively devastating happening this morning there on the south end of the island of Manhattan. That is once again a picture of, one of the towers of the World Trade Center. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE: Today is Monday, September 11th, and it marks the 22nd anniversary of the attacks on American soil. The day caused chaos, terror and death when the Al-Qaeda terrorist group carried out coordinated attacks against America, nearly 3000 people were killed when terrorists flew commercial airplanes into the World Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Today, on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil, president Joe Biden is scheduled to observe the moment at a military base in Alaska with service members and their families. First lady, Jill Biden will lay a wreath at the 9/11 Memorial at the Pentagon. And Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to participate in the annual ceremony at the National September 11 Memorial Museum in New York.  We'll go inside that museum with our Kate Bolduan now as the nation pauses to reflect and remember those who lost their lives on that tragic day. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOE DANIELS, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL SEPTEMBER 11 MEMORIAL & MUSEUM: These tridents were from the north tower. They were recovered in the aftermath of the attacks. We brought them back here and basically built the museum all around them. KATE BOLDUAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Joe Daniels is President and CEO of the 9/11 Memorial. (On camera): You're not whitewashing it. This is the raw, dirty material? DANIELS: Exactly. I mean, this is the steel that, that bore the attacks. BOLDUAN: The museum is built almost entirely underground. Some 70 feet down, it sits in the precise footprint of the World Trade Center.  (On camera): Yeah. DANIELS: So this is exactly where the south tower started and went up 1,350 feet.  BOLDUAN: A striking display of the sheer scale of the destruction with poignant reminders of the tragedy at every turn. (On camera): I mean, this -- this is unbelievable. DANIELS: This is actually the front of this fire truck. This is the cab. BOLDUAN: You wouldn't know? DANIELS: Wouldn't know, and it's -- it's completely burned out and destroyed. BOLDUAN: Then there's the retaining wall that remarkably held strong, even when the towers fell. DANIELS: When the towers came down, all that debris that was here right in this space, provided bracing for that wall. And when that debris was clear, there was a big concern that the wall would breach, would flood lower Manhattan. BOLDUAN: It could have been so much worse, but this wall helped under all of that pressure.  (On camera): Visitors will also walk alongside the survivor stairs. DANIELS: Used by hundreds of people, as the buildings are crumbling, running from the dust cloud to escape to safety, and, it's for all our visitors to understand the story of survival. BOLDUAN: And likely one of the most emotional stops in the museum. This art installation mimics the blue sky on that fateful morning behind it, the still unidentified remains of 9/11 victims. The move met with mixed emotion from their families. DANIELS: A still shocking statistic is that 1100 family members never got any human remains back to bury. Never got to go through the -- the ritual of laying their loved ones to rest. That's not a public space at all. Only family members are allowed back behind the wall. BOLDUAN: Right next door, a room dedicated to the lives of those lost. DANIELS: Exactly that room is in an area called In Memoriam. And it's a photographic portrait of each and every one of the 2,983 victims. You see pictures, a father coaching his son's little league team, a wedding. You see the lives that were -- that were lost that day. And not just about how they died, it's who these people were. BOLDUAN: Throughout the museum, chilling reminders of the day, handmade flyers for the missing, across emerging from the wreckage, everyday items simply left behind. DANIELS: We help through these artifacts and images. Tell that story of just it was panic. BOLDUAN: And while the museum is vast, one small exhibit has been the biggest source of controversy. Its focus, the terrorists themselves, including a film criticized for not making a clear enough distinction between Islam and Al-Qaeda.  (On camera): There's been a lot of criticism. Why give any time to the terrorists? DANIELS: You know, it's -- it's one way to look at it is you don't build a Holocaust museum and not be very clear that the Nazis were the ones who committed those atrocities. Al-Qaeda was an extremist terrorist group. But no one will come through this exhibit. And in any way, think that we are indicting an entire religion, which we in no way are. BOLDUAN: It seems very appropriate that you end here at the last column? DANIELS: And it's, again goes right back to resiliency, seeing those messages of hope and remembrance on this very tall column, that's still standing strong. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Around 30 million people, mark September 11th on their calendars each year and participate in charitable activities around the country. To learn more, you can head to CNN's Impact Your World site, to find volunteer opportunities and other ways to support those impacted. We'll put links to that and ways to support the Morocco earthquake relief efforts in the description of this video, on our YouTube channel.  I'm Coy Wire.

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news where I simply deliver the what, letting you decide what to think.  We begin today with an update on North Korea and Russia. On Sunday, a train presumed to be carrying North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reportedly left the capital of Pyongyang on its way to Russia.  Why does this matter? A highly anticipated meeting between Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin is of concern for the United States and its allies who fear the meeting might lead to an arms deal where North Korea supplies weapons for Russia's war in Ukraine.  Experts also fear that Russia might provide North Korea with new technology that could pose danger to the United States and its allies. Also significant, this trip would be Kim's first known trip venturing beyond North Korea's border since the COVID-19 pandemic when the country had its borders locked down.  While the two countries have been secretive about the meeting, it's thought to be happening in Vladivostok, a Russian city far to the east where the two leaders first met in the April of 2019. Senior International Correspondent Will Ripley, based in Taipei, Taiwan, has more.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Inside North Korea, one of the most secretive places on the planet, a carefully guarded state secret, his leader Kim Jong Un's actual location. Major events are often used as decoys. Crowds can wait for hours, enduring long security lines, only to find the leader's seat empty.  Even Kim's own bodyguards can serve as decoys, best known for donning dark suits, running alongside the leader's limo during the Trump-Kim summits, projecting power and security, riding an armor-reinforced rail card to Russia, to meet with President Vladimir Putin, a fellow strongman seen by some as a global pariah.  Putin and Kim come with plenty of baggage, both saddled with heavy sanctions, for Kim's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, for Putin's brutal, unprovoked war on Ukraine, and suspiciously timed plane crash taking out his one-time critic.  Kim may not have a reason to fear Putin, but he still does not take any chances when he travels outside North Korea. As Moscow looks to buy artillery and other wartime supplies from its impoverished authoritarian neighbor.  CNN contacted the Russian embassy in Washington for comment. North Korea denied previously supplying Russia with rockets and missiles to use in Ukraine. In July, Putin's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was in Pyongyang as Kim showed off his latest weapons, long-range missiles and military drones. Shoigu said Russia may even be staging joint military drills with the North. The North Korean leader has a lot to gain.  DAVID SANGER, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  A large power is now dependent on him. That hasn't happened in a while.  RIPLEY:  Kim may be willing to roll the dice, risking travel outside his borders, reducing the risk on a slow-moving, heavily fortified train.  A shade of army green on the outside, luxuriously appointed on the inside. The train is a symbol of three generations of the Kim family dynasty and a nation stuck in the past. Kim has taken his chugging locomotive to Vladivostok before, meeting with Putin there in 2019.  This time, Kim may hope Russia will help him with oil supplies or even technology to use in its own ambitious ballistic missile program. Goal is perhaps worthy of a rare venture beyond his nation's hermetically sealed borders.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Pop quiz hot shot. The atmosphere of Mars is made primarily of what chemical compound?  Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide, Methane or Argon?  If you said CO2, you are winning. The Mar's atmosphere is over 95% carbon dioxide.  Mars has been the focus for several space agencies and companies with ambitions of taking humans to infinity and beyond, but humans aren't naturally made to be multi-planetary movers. The conditions on the red planet Mars, for example, would be pretty harsh for us earthlings. But many ideas, some very wild, are being discussed as solutions to making Mars livable.  One idea sprung from NASA, landing on Mars in 2021 with the Perseverance rover. It's called MOXIE, short for Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment. Yeah, I don't see how that makes sense either.  Anyways, MOXIE's goal was to make oxygen right there on Mars by converting the abundance of carbon dioxide into precious oxygen. And the results of the experiment are in. The device, no bigger than a microwave, generated 122 grams of oxygen. How much is that? About what your average small dog would breathe in 10 hours or so. So not too shaggy.  Questions remain though, will future tests confirm these results, could the technology be scaled to provide astronauts with breathable air? And how much would this cost, and is it even worth it?  Some question whether humanity should be focusing and spending on these types of efforts when we could be focusing on making our planet better instead. For the technology itself though, this is seen by NASA as a successful experiment far exceeding their expectations.  At its peak, MOXIE produced 12 grams of 98% pure oxygen per hour, twice as much as NASA hoped for. So this might mean that we are one step closer to some people someday becoming Mar's.  Next up, the U.S. has around 150,000 U.S. auto workers in the United Auto Workers Union, and they could be gearing up for a strike this week. Why? If the big three automakers, General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis can't meet their demands, which include pay raises and better benefits.  Last week, both sides started tossing around their ideas, and while they made a little progress, it might not be enough to prevent union workers in various states from hitting the picket lines if their demands aren't met before their contract expires. If they strike it could throw a major wrench in car production here in the United States.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you ready to rumble? CROWD:  Yeah. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS & POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  There's a showdown in Detroit.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What do we want? Fair contract!  YURKEVICH:  The United Auto Workers Union is less than a week away from a possible strike against the big three U.S. automakers, General Motors, Ford and Stellantis.  CROWD:  We are the union.  YURKEVICH:  Teeing up what would be the second largest U.S. labor strike in a quarter century. UAW says their demands have not been met, waiting nearly a month on new proposals.  SHAWN FAIN, PRESIDENT, UNITED AUTO WORKERS:  I'll tell you what I'm going to do with their proposal, I'm going to file it in its proper place because that's where it belongs, the trash.  YURKEVICH:  The tensions have been high between the two sides. The Union representing 145,000 workers at the three automakers even filed unfair labor practice complaints against GM and Stellantis, accusing the companies of not bargaining in good faith, which they denied.  GERALD JOHNSON, EVP, GENERAL MOTORS:  These negotiations are serious and they matter. The outcome impacts all of us, every team member and quite frankly, every stakeholder across the country.  YURKEVICH:  For the first time ever, the UAW could strike all three automakers at once. The last strike in 2019 against General Motors cost the company $2.9 billion over six weeks. A strike against all three could mean $5 billion in losses in just ten days.  JULIE SU, ACTING LABOR SECRETARY:  We respect their process and are hopeful that they are going to grapple through some hard issues and hopefully come to an agreement that's a win, win.  YURKEVICH:  The union has some ambitious demands asking for a 40% pay raise over the course of the four-year contract, restoring cost of living increases and pension plans for all workers.  FAIN:  They've had our demands from the outset, and we told them we expect to get there by September 14th, and that is September 14th, a deadline, not a reference point.  YURKEVICH:  And as the big three pivot to electric vehicles, they're planning 10 new battery plants not under UAW contracts. The union is hoping these next contracts protect their members in the future.  FAIN:  Workers can't be left behind in this transition. You're talking about 20% of the power train workers in the big three stand to lose their jobs down the road if we go from ICE engines to battery power.  YURKEVICH: Vanessa Yurkevich, CNN, New York.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's story getting a 10 out of 10, a wild storm knocking over a tree. Well, it's swarming with a bunch of irritated honey bees and honey, that's not good. So guess who shows up to save the day? A friendly neighborhood news reporter, Nick Beres from WTV News Channel 5 in Nashville.  But here's the kicker, Nick isn't just any old reporter, he's actually a seasoned beekeeper, y 'all. So he buzzes in to be the hero, jumping right into the buzzing chaos, clearing out the bees to prevent them from taking over the neighborhood. Well done.  You better believe it's time for our favorite part of the show, you. Knox, Indiana, Knox Community High School, rise up. I believe in all of you. So keep on grinding and shining cause that's just what we do.  I'm Coy Wire, this is CNN 10. And I'll see you tomorrow.  END230913

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up lovely people. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. And it's your CNN 10. Especially on a #YourWordWednesday. Follow me @coywire on Insta, Snapchat, and TikTok. Put your unique vocabulary word in the comment section of my most recent post. And we'll choose one fun one to work into tomorrow. Show let's go.  Now we do have to begin with some tough news out of Libya where around 5,300 people at least had died at the time of this recording, 10,000 more believed to still be missing. And it's the result of a terrible storm. The storm's name is Daniel, and it dumped so much rain on Libya's Northeast that two dams collapse, sending water flowing into already inundated areas. And in some cases, washing whole neighborhoods away. The rain is a result of a very strong, low-pressure system that brought catastrophic flooding to Greece last week and moved into the Mediterranean before developing into a tropical like cyclone known as a Medicane, which is a combination of the words Mediterranean and hurricane.  In addition, the collapse of two dams under the pressure of the flooding water sent even more water rushing toward these towns, creating more catastrophic damage. Strong currents, also carrying debris and even vehicles adding to the damage. It looks like this storm is one of the deadliest on record in north Africa.  In the wake of the tragedy, several countries have offered aid to Libya and rescue teams are scrambling to find survivors and assess the damage. In the nation of Morocco, a 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck late Friday night. More than 2,900 people had died at the time of this recording and rescuers continued to race against the clock to search through rubble for survivors. The quake is the strongest to hit Morocco's center in more than a century. The epicenter of the quake was in close proximity to many tourist areas and the economic center of Marrakesh.  Complicating, the relief efforts is the nearby terrain of the Atlas Mountains, home to many isolated villages that have been devastated by this quake. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER:  It certainly has been a somewhat delayed effort where today in the village of Moulay Brahim. And you can see behind me just how remote some of these villages are.  We are high up in the Atlas Mountains, and that has proven to be a real struggle for rescue teams. Many of these villages, many of the hardest hit areas across Morocco are in these remote high up mountainous areas. And that has proven to be a real challenge for rescue teams.  Now, just yesterday, we were in another village further up, further south, and this is a village which has proven hugely difficult to reach. We spoke to people there who have been impacted by the earthquake. They told us that the international rescue teams had only just made it to the village yesterday, that they had been spending days digging through the rubble of their collapsed homes with their bare hands.  And they have, uh, only just begun to receive that humanitarian aid, have only just begun to see doctors and medical personnel on the ground there. And of course it has been difficult to reach some of these areas. The roads have been blocked in some places because of the debris, because of damage to the roads. But of course there is still a real sense of frustration among these residents in these remote villages, around that delayed response.  Many people on our living in temporary shelters, including in this village, you can see at the homes damage behind me, just further down the mountain, many families living tent shelters now. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Let's travel to Columbia in south America now where CNN Chief Climate Correspondent, Bill Weir has details on an innovative project to preserve the cotton-top tamarin, acute monkey that is among the most endangered primates in the world. They're only found in Northwestern, Columbia and their tropical forest habitat is being destroyed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In one particular corner of one particular country, there lives a creature that exists nowhere else in the world. This is Columbia and word is their unique species is adorable and elusive and critically endangered. A combination that can frustrate when trying to spot one, but trudging through a forest hot as a sauna, our odds are better than average. Thanks to people who know them really well. ROSAMIRA GUILLEN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR/ CO-FOUNDER, FOUNDATION PROYECTO TITI:  They love the nature of the flowers and they stick their hair, you know, their hair like in the flower like that, in their hair -- their facial hair. WEIR:  Rosamira Guillen started her career as a landscape architect. But when she was hired to help build a zoo, she met the animal that would change her life and theirs, the cotton-top tamarin, a little monkey with a look right out of Dr. Seus.  (On camera):  I can see why you fell in love with these little guys. GUILLEN:  Oh yeah. You know, how can you -- how can you not? WEIR:  When she learned that the illegal pet trade and slash and burn cattle ranching had driven them to the brink of extinction, her architect mind shifted from building zoos to rebuilding forests, which is much more difficult than just dropping seeds and soil. GUILLEN:  It may take a day to cut a hector forest, but to rebuild it, it takes about 20 years.  WEIR (voice-over):  She's learned that rewilding takes sweat, smarts, and human relations. Because in order to connect the titi's fragmented habitat, she would need land. And the cooperation of ranchers who do not share her love for these monkeys. (On camera):  Is it harder working with nature or human nature?  GUILLEN:  Definitely human nature. oh, I would be happy to just hang out with the monkeys and in the forest. Our goal is to get to a certain point with there's enough for them to be stable and make it in the long term, right? Um, our fears is that, you know, you always fear that you don't get enough support to keep going.  While we save this beautiful forest for them, we're saving the forest for many other animals, you know, so all by diversity. WEIR:  And a livable planet for us? GUILLEN:  And a livable planet for us. Exactly, because we get water, we get air, we get lots of resources and that's -- that's why we focus so much on connecting people with nature, to appreciate it and -- and care for it and want to do something about it. With a little help, we can make it, because we've got the experience, we've done it. And, uh, it works. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Pop quiz, hot shot. Part of the Pacific Ocean, what body of water is located on the Southern curve of Alaska? Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Beaufort Sea or Chukchi Sea? All these waterways surround Alaska, but the Gulf of Alaska is your answer here. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The yellow hat. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This mysterious golden specimen was found during a deep-sea expedition in the Gulf of Alaska. This is some sort of crusting sponge.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Uh, yeah. I don't know what to make at that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Scientist aboard NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer say they discovered it about two miles below surface. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't know what to think about this. It looks like we're seeing in the chatted dead sponge attachment, which kind of makes sense why I didn't even know where to start. It seems spongy, but now I'm seeing potential egg case, which I could see that as well. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Dubbed the golden orb researchers say they have so far been unable to identify what it is, but confirm it is biological and origin. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah, let's give it a little tickle.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, soft. Soft thermal air. OK. Hmm, yeah. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not sure if it'll just fall apart. If I try to grab it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It seems like it, it seems pretty delicate. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Scientists have taken it to a lab to learn more about it. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  How many of you have ever heard of bioluminescence? Well, check out these waves in Orange County, California, this naturally occurring phenomenon occurs when water is turned up, like these waves causing a chemical reaction in light emitting organisms, like algae blooms. There aren't many places in the world where you can see bioluminescence occurring naturally, and it doesn't exclusively occur on beaches either.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello sunshine. It's Thursday, September 14th. So happy Friday, Eve. Time for random thought Thursday. Why is it that we drive on a Parkway, but we park on a driveway? I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news, where I tell you the what, letting you decide what to think. In Russia, North Korean Leader, Kim Jong Un, and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin had a meeting at a Russian Space Center on Wednesday. Here's the scoop, U.S. officials have given a heads up that Putin might try to use this meeting to get some military weapons for his invasion of Ukraine. During their meeting, Kim Jong Un showed support for Russia's invasion. Kim even went as far as saying he'll, "always be standing with Russia."  On the flip side, Putin seems to be hinting that he could assist Kim with his space program and the new technology for the North Korean military. North Korea has been putting a lot of emphasis on space technology lately, but they've had a couple of failed attempts this year to launch a spy satellite into orbit.  This meeting is a big deal because Putin has been isolated on the international stage due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. And he's in need of more fire power after 18 months of fighting. Kim Jong Un has been talking about the importance of military satellites to safeguard national security and secure territory. For more here's CNN Senior International Correspondent, Matthew Chance. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the leaders of these two most heavily sanctioned countries in the world met face-to-  face at the Vostochny Cosmodrome in the Russian far east, where Jong Un and Vladimir Putin, um, toured a brand new Russian space, rocket launch facility. President Putin indicating that Russia would look to help North Korea with its space technology. Later at a formal dinner, Kim voice support for what he said was Russia's fight against imperialism, a reference to Russia's standoff with the west over Ukraine. But in terms of tangible results, frankly, there's not been much, no agreement signed as far as we know, no joint news conference, the whole visit carefully choreographed and shrouded in secrecy.  But of course, that doesn't rule out the possibility that a deal may have been done behind the scenes. Russia desperately needs weapons in ammunition to sustain its war in Ukraine and North Korea is believed to have vast stock piles. North Korea in turn has an ambitious missile and satellite launch program, which may well benefit from Russia knowhow. But of course, that kind of transfer may have profound consequences, both on the volatile Korean Peninsula and on the front lines in Ukraine. Matthew Chance, CNN, Moscow. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Maybe you've noticed lately that lots of things seem to be getting a bit more expensive. Maybe the cost of food at the school cafeteria has gone up, or the amount of money used to spend on a movie ticket in popcorn is now only enough to get you the ticket. Now that's inflation. The term used to measure how much prices go up in the United States economy over a certain period of time. U.S. inflation accelerated in August for the second straight month, pushed up by rising gas prices. Across the country on a month-to-month basis, prices rose 0.6% in August, compared with a 0.2% gain in July. All this will impact the U.S. federal reserve, which will decide next week if there will be another interest rate hike. A hike means you must pay more on interest charges from your credit card company for mortgages and even car loans will become more expensive. We'll hear more now on what to expect. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The U.S. economy is facing a couple of major hurdles, including another possible shutdown of the federal government next month. REP. NANCY MACE, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA: Both sides, both Republicans and Democrats have put us in this place where we have extraordinarily high inflation, where we're going to add 18.8 trillion to the debt in the next 10 years. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The United Auto Workers Union could announce a strike on Friday. SHARDEE AKEEM, FORD EMPLOYEE: Since inflation is off the chart, it's not beneficial to me to be working that or making half what other people are making or not receiving the benefits that they're making. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And oil prices, which affect the cost of gas prices, our forecast to stay up through the end of the year. However --  PAUL KRUGMAN, ECONOMIST: People are out there with a lot discretionary consumer spending, travel, hotels, restaurants, all of that is booming. So people are acting as if they're in good shape financially, and yet they say, wow, this is a disastrous economy. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Ten second trivia.  In what country would you find the Taurus Mountains? Greece, Turkey, Mongolia, Spain? Located in Southern Turkey, the Taurus mountains are home to some of the world's deepest caves. Up next, let's talk about this intense international rescue mission causing quite the brouhaha in one of Turkey's super deep caves on Tuesday. A researcher was doing his thing, exploring the cave when he suddenly got really sick and he couldn't climb out on his own. Here's CNN International Correspondent, Jomana Karadsheh with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Shortly before, 1:00 a.m. local time in Turkey, the cave rescue operation of American Caver Mark Dickey came to an end, a successful one as we saw those images of his stretcher being pulled out of Turkey's third deepest cave. Dickey appeared to be smiling, giving thumbs up. We heard from Turkish officials saying that he seemed to be fine and that they were going to get him on a chopper out of there and move him to Mersin Hospital in Southern Turkey where he will be headed for the medical treatment he needs.  Now, this has been a very, very complex operation. It has lasted days. Mark Dickey, an experienced caver was part of an international and a local expedition. And when he fell ill at about more than 3000 feet, more than thousand meters from the surface. But over the past few days he had been stabilized. He was improving. He was walking. He was talking. We even saw a video recorded by -- released by Dickey where he spoke about his condition, but also explaining that he was still not OK on the inside and that he needed medical treatment.  And this was such a complex operation again, because this is, uh, one of the deepest caves in the world. We're also talking according to experts about a cave with very narrow and winding passages. So putting him on a stretcher and getting him out of there, would've been very, very difficult. So they have to look at the different options consulting with doctors to make sure they can get him out of there.  And finally, this operation, this extraction began on Saturday and it involved nearly 200 rescuers from different countries. It was a real multinational effort to try and get him out of there. And they moved in phases over the past few days. They would move. They would stop, rest a bit, and then move again until they made it out of that cave. This certainly is going to be good news for the family, friends, colleagues of Mark Dickey and all those who have been involved in this rescue operation that has brought an end to this ordeal. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN London. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Frank Rubio has been out of this world for over 355 days now. He just smashed the previous record for longest space mission by a U.S. astronaut. His mission was only supposed to be six months, but his spacecraft spring a leak, leaving him chilling in the international space station since September of 2022. And he's not stopping there when he wraps up this mission, he'll have spent at least 371 days in orbit. He's on the verge of becoming the first American to rack up more than a year in microgravity.  Big thanks to the heart of the Rocky Mountains, Mr. Sposado (ph) and his historians at summit in Frisco, Colorado, #YourWordWednesday winners for brouhaha, a no meaning noisy and over excited reaction to something.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up lovely people. Happy Friday, Friyay. Let's unleash our full potential, take good vibes and lots of love into this weekend. Make a feel-good Friday. Remember what is within influences what happens without.  I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. And we start with news on Hurricane Lee. On Thursday, this storm was already making quite a scene in Bermuda, whipping up some serious winds. It looks like this hurricane is taking a Northern route and picking up the pace.  Lee is expected to bring some heavy rain, strong winds and coastal flooding, and it looks like it's making its way all the way up towards new England and Canada, and will likely stick around through the weekend.  Hurricane Lee might only affect coastal areas, making landfall somewhere between Northeast main and Nova Scotia in Canada. Hurricane and tropical storm watches have already been issued for many coastal areas in new England.  We're not entirely sure what to expect in terms of damage just yet, but we do know that conditions in the ocean like the atmosphere and super warm water temperatures have been creating greater risk from increased storms this season,. Let's head to Morocco now where there's a scientific mystery that if solved might be able to help us predict earthquakes before they happen. Video taken before Friday's 6.8 magnitude earthquake in Morocco captured mysterious lights in the nighttime sky. They're called earthquake lights and reports of these types of atmospheric illuminations actually date back to Ancient Greece would you believe.  Experts say earthquake lights can appear in different forms and colors. They could be dancing across the sky or look like glowing floating spheres. They could even appear as flickering flames creeping across the ground. Seismologists and scientists are trying to unlock the mysteries of these illuminating outbursts. Some experts say that certain crystals in rocks generate electricity when they break during an earthquake.  The hope is that one day we might be able to use these earthquake lights or the electric charge that causes them to help predict major earthquakes before they happen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Sheltering from the sweltering September heat, survivors of Morocco's earthquake spend another day coming to terms with a tragedy that has befallen this shaken community.  Temporary shelters for those left homeless by the earthquake have been set up across this region. Many of the tents that you can see here have been supplied either by the Moroccan government or by local organizations and charities. But the Moroccan government has also requested assistance from members of the international community. And we've seen these international teams on the ground providing support, not only on the search and rescue front, but also with the humanitarian relief effort. ROBERT NORMAN, UK INTERNATIONAL SEARCH AND RESCUE, COMMAND SUPPORT OFFICER: The immediate priorities for our team is always saving life, following on from that where we can help medical assistance identify humanitarian needs. So that even when that rescue phase does close, we've provided all the information we can to help humanitarian relief that will follow us. BASHIR: Across the quake zone here in Morocco, there has also been an outpouring of support from the local community, with donations or food, water, and medication.  The volunteers here tell us they still need more tents and crucially long- term support with the rebuild effort. The government says the reconstruction of homes lost in the disaster is a priority, but for so many impacted families, there is no telling how long it'll be before they have a real home to return to. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Let's talk now about the future of AI or artificial intelligence, the science of making machines that can think like humans while also processing large amounts of data in ways that humans can't. Some of the largest leaders in tech high profile CEOs and members of the Senate met this week in Washington. Why? They were in deep conversation about the future of AI regulations. And they had some serious words of caution about AI, including the potential impact on humanity, like potentially putting humans out of jobs or what might happen if it's not used responsibly and regulated correctly. But it wasn't all doom and gloom. They also chatted about how AI could be a total game changer in a good way for our future society. To give us the low down on all this AI drama, here's CNN Tech Quiz, Brian Fung. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN FUNG, CNN REPORTER:  There's broad agreement that government should have some role in regulating AI, but there is still no consensus on how. That's the big takeaway from a day long summit on Capitol hill involving some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world.  In the meeting, Bill Gates spoke of how AI could help end world hunger. Others talked about its potential to cure cancer. Elon Musk to the meeting "may go down in history as being very important for the future of civilization." But questions are still swirling about how the us might approach AI regulation. Does the U.S. need a new federal agency to regulate AI? What about bans on AI and political advertising? How soon could Congress come up with a comprehensive bill? Many of these questions are still unresolved after Gates, Musk, and others like Mark Zuckerberg descended on Washington to offer their views.  Meanwhile, officials in the meeting from the entertainment industry and labor and civil rights groups called for protecting workers, writers, and minorities from some of the harms that AI could cause. Senators coming out of the meeting said most everyone agreed, the United States should remain a leader in AI development while also trying to protect people. But outside of the meeting room, some lawmakers took issue with how the sessions were closed to the public. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia.  What family-based TV show first aired in 1969, featuring an opening sequence with a 3x3 grid of cast members looking around at each other?  Family Ties, Family Matters, The Brady Bunch or All In The family? The Brady Bunch, that's the way to correctly answer this question.  Here's the story of the home better known as the Brady Bunch House. It's in studio city, California, the iconic house sold this week for 3.2 million. The inside was designed by HGTV a few years ago to replicate the original sets used on the show. Pretty cool. It's like stepping back in time, but despite the nostalgia, the property actually sold for millions under the asking price. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The iconic Brady Bunch House just sold for a loss. Purchased in 2018, for 3.5 million, HGTV spent 1.9 million renovating it to replicate the sets from the hit TV sitcom. The updates were part of HGTV is a very Brady renovation series. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  One gigantic problem with the existing house was that it had no space for all the rooms that were on the Brady Bunch set. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hello. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just like stepping back in time. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a strange kind of place between fiction and reality. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's the Brady's home. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The 5,140-foot home was listed in May for 5.5 million, but sold for only 3.2 million. A portion of the proceeds will go to turn up, fight hunger, CNN and HGTV share pair and company Warner Brothers Discovery.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, lovely people. Hope you had an awesome weekend. So good to be back with you. Let's start this week strong. Remember complacency is the constant enemy. Let's learn one thing or do something today that makes us a little better today than we were yesterday.  It's Constitution week here in the United States. The document that starts with the famous words, we, the people was signed 236 years ago on Sunday. The Constitution created a charter for the United States as we know it today. Of course, it hasn't stayed the same since 1787. There have been various changes or amendments through the years.  In 1791, the first 10 amendments of the constitution were ratified. Forming what is known as the bill of rights. They list specific prohibitions on the government's power and guarantee certain individual protections and liberties in the United States like freedom of speech. And that leads us to pop quiz hotshot.  Since the Bill of Rights, how many additional amendments have been added to the Constitution?  7, 10, 15, or 17? Put your hands up if you've said 17. The most recent the 27th amendment was passed in 1992.  More news now on the historic and unprecedented United Auto Workers strike against the big three American automakers, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. It's unprecedented because this is the first time in its history that the Union has struck all three of America's unionized car makers.  Union workers are seeking increased wages, benefits, and job protections. The demands come as all three auto makers reported record or near record profits. The union is trying to recapture many benefits they had been forced to give up more than a decade ago when the companies were cash starved and on the brink of bankruptcy. Union members say they had reasonably productive talks with Ford on Saturday, but the Union and the three major companies still remain far apart on wages and benefits.  Ford and General Motors have responded to the strike by threatening layoffs for non-striking workers due to the lack of parts from striking plants. General Motors says they will lay off up to 2000 workers this week if the strike continues. But the workers walking the picket line, they say that they're going to stick it out until they get a deal that suits them. Negotiations were ongoing at the time of this recording. Here's our Rahel Solomon with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, this is going to come down to time, ultimately. How economically costly this ultimately is, will really hinge on how long the strike continues. Now, if it is an extended strike while analysts warn the economic costs will add up. One estimate from the Anderson Economic Group, estimates that the strike could cost the economy $5 billion if it lasts 10 days.  Now, one thing to consider with that estimate is that, that would've been a full strike of UAW 143,000 workers at this point about a 10th of that figure is actually striking. So keep that in mind, but that estimate does include things like lost pay, losses to manufacturers, but also suppliers.  Now guys, if it feels like there have been more strikes than usual. Yeah, it's not just your imagination. So what's behind the increased strike activity, both here in the U.S. and around the world, to be honest, while I asked our wheat in that he runs the labor program at Cornell and he says high inflation, a tight labor market, which has workers feeling like they have the upper hand. They can ask for the things that they want. Also public support has steadily increased for Unions. And also COVID-19 as workers continue to think about the type of work life balance that they want.  Now, in terms of wages, Auto Workers fall behind the average worker. This is average. According to government data, the average hourly worker for an Auto Worker is about $27.99. Whereas the average worker around the country makes about $33.82.  Now we should say for the automaker's part, you know, they say, wait a minute, we have to worry about prices as well, because we have to compete with the non-union competitors. And so they have to be conscious of prices as well. I mean, that's what the automakers are saying. Clearly the two sides are still pretty far apart. It seems at least from what we can tell. But ultimately the damage that could be caused in terms of the economy will really just depend on how long this strike ultimately takes. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Moving on now to the latest about Hurricane Lee, which was reclassed as a post-tropical cyclone, before it made landfall over the weekend. Lee hit Canada's east coast on Saturday with strong wind, heavy rain and flooding. Tens of thousands of people lost power in the storm. It's the eighth time since 2016 that a storm in the North Atlantic has reached Category 5 or the highest category for hurricanes.  There have been 10 named storms in the Atlantic since August 20th, breaking the old record for most name storms in the Atlantic between August 20th and September 16th. Experts say this kind of severe weather could continue to happen more often as oceans warm up and it's keeping hurricane hunters busy. CNN's Gary Tuchman joined a team of these scientists on a flight to document the storm last week. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GARY TUCHMAN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The Gulfstream IV is typically a business jet, but this one is reconfigured. And its business is to help protect lives. These are the hurricane hunters, eight scientists, engineers, pilots. They work for the National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration known as NOAA. Paul Flaherty is the Flight Director and a Flight Meteorologist. PAUL FLAHERTY, FLIGHT DIRECTOR & FLIGHT METEOROLOGIST: We want to make sure we're collecting data in data sparse areas in which there's currently no data available, very little data available for the weather models to use, to make forecasts. TUCHMAN (on camera): For this mission, this aircraft flies an altitude between 41,000 and 45,000 feet. It travels around 500 miles per hour. This is essentially a flying weather station, a weather station that goes to the weather. (Voice-over): For the next eight hours, the men and women of the NOAA Corps will fly in this high-altitude reconnaissance jet above, below, around and in front of Hurricane Lee. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think for now we'll be fine, but --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah, looks like plenty of space to maneuver around things. TUCHMAN: After the jet leaves, Lakeland, Florida skies are clear at this high altitude. You can clearly see storm churn white caps in the ocean. It doesn't take long though for the sunshine to disappear. The flight gets turbulent as Hurricane Lee lurks ominously below us. All the while signs is taking place. This screen shows 34 locations where at two known as a drop sound or sand will be dropped out of the plane. (On camera): So this is the next drop sand. It's going to be drops. Rebecca Keller, NOAA engineer. What is in the drops? REBECCA KELLER, NOAA ENGINEER: So the drop zone consists of a sensor. And we have a circuit board inside as well as a battery. And the sensor is picking up humidity, air temperature, pressure, wind direction, and wind speed. TUCHMAN: And about every 10 minutes, another drop sound with a parachute that is deployed is launched to the ground. Along with the sands, the plane also has radar in its nose, doppler radar in its tail. And two pilots up front flying with a deep sense of purpose. LT. CMDR. DANIELLE VARWIG, NOAA PILOT: I joined the NOAA Corps as did all of my counterparts because we love to serve our country. We care about our -- the citizens. And so it's really rewarding to know that I am like right at the front lines and risking my life in order to help the lives of everyone else that are back home. TUCHMAN: The marathon flight is almost over. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right! So that is the last "sonde" of the -- Woohoo, Woohoo indeed. TUCHMAN: And as the plane heads back to Florida out the window. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Looking good. TUCHMAN: A spectacular sunset.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah, so we're out of the storm environment, obviously. This will be just fair-weather cumulus on our way back to Florida. TUCHMAN: As the plane gets ready to land time for the hurricane hunters to decompress and get mentally ready for more eight-hour trips to come. LT. CMDR. RICK DE TRIQUET, NOAA AIRCRAFT COMMANDER: So yeah, we kind of live up here, spend more time together than we do at home. Go home, sleep, eat, and repeat, you know, and get back up here, start collecting the data again. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Arizona Saguaro National Park and unidentified creature causing quite the stink on a surveillance camera. What is this?

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. You are awesome. And we have places to go and things to learn from Africa to Alaska and few stops in between. Welcome to the best 10 minutes in news.  We start in Libya, the country at the top of Africa. If you're looking at a map right between Tunisia and Egypt next to the Mediterranean sea. Last Sunday, Libya was hit by a rare type of storm called a Medicane, a combination of the words Mediterranean and hurricane. And the deadly storm dumped record setting rain on Libya with more than 16 inches in some places over a 24-hour span. The rain strained two aging dams near the Eastern city of Derna, which has a population roughly the size of Bend, Oregon, Abilene, Texas, or Allentown, Pennsylvania, both dams burst last week, and water overwhelmed, entire districts of Derna destroying homes and businesses sweeping them away, or even burying them with mud.  As of this Sunday, the death toll across Libya was all over the place with outlets reporting anywhere from 4,000 to 20,000 people. And that's because the damage has been so severe and widespread. And whatever that number is, thousands more are still missing. This is the deadliest flood to hit any African country in more than a century. Our International Correspondent, Larry Madowo has been following the story and is learning for us the factors and scale of this disaster. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The Eastern Libya city of Derna, might never be the same, even with the best of efforts to rebuild the U.N. warning that the catastrophic flooding led to an unprecedented humanitarian crisis there. We will never know the exact number of people that were killed when Storm Daniel dumped unprecedented levels of water here, busting to dams and entire neighborhoods washing into the sea, into the Mediterranean. In the absence of any proper coordination between Libya's two rival governments, ordinary Libyans have been doing what they can, including donating blood. And they're also aware of the divided country that they live in. MUSTATA RAJABANI, BLOOD DONOR (through translator):  We feel sorry for those who lost their lives. And we ask God almighty that he take pity on the others. Unfortunately, we hate to admit that this catastrophe has highlighted the fact that we do not have a state capable of dealing with a crisis of this scale. MADOWO:  Even though rescue efforts continue. It's been a week since the flooding happened. So the chances of finding survivors alive is very limited. Libyan State Media say 891 buildings are completely destroyed there. Another 211 buildings are partially damaged and 398 others submerged. So this brings to almost 15% of buildings in Derna that were affected by this flooding.  The African Union Chairperson is calling on other African member states, the international community to offer more support because that's what so many people need here. At the same time. The U.N. warning that about 40,000 people have been displaced. And as they're on the move, they are exposed to landmines and explosive ordinances of war after more than a decade of conflict in the country. So it's just a mixture of the most terrible conditions possible. Larry Madowo, CNN Nairobi. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Let's move now to Central America in the country of Panama, where there's not enough water in the Panama Canal, the iconic waterway, and that's due to an ongoing drought. The canal was built more than 100 years ago and it connects the Pacific ocean to the Atlantic ocean. It's a valuable shipping route that saves vessels a lot of time and a long, more dangerous journey down around the Southern tip of south America.  Let's go to our CNN International Correspondent, Patrick Oppmann, who explains how we might all be affected by the water levels on this 50-mile route. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The Panama Canal is running low on water. A persistent drought caused in part by the El Nino weather pattern has left water levels dangerously depleted. Now, the global supply chain is under threat as the holiday season approaches.  The 80-kilometer waterway connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and is a vital route for transporting goods, handling an estimated 5% of world trade. The canal was completed in 1914, revolutionizing how goods were used to supply goods could be transported and further expanded in 2016 to meet the skyrocketing demands of global commerce. But over the last 20 years, decreasing rainfall has reduced the water level of Panama's Lake Gatun from 27 meters above sea level to 24 meters.  Canal officials have imposed draft restrictions, forcing ships to lighten their load. A ship's draft limit is the minimum depth of water it can safely navigate. And if a ship is carrying too much cargo, it risks getting trapped in the canal. Since May, ships have had to reduce their cargo by as much as 25%. The Panama Canal Authority has also limited the number of vessels authorized to enter the canal each day. Creating a bottleneck with some ships waiting as long as 14 days to get through. As of Tuesday, 116 vessels were waiting to pass.  The canal's administrator warns the number of authorized vessels could decrease further when the drought continues into next year. This has led to rising freight costs which are likely to continue in the months leading up to both Christmas and the Chinese New Year. The Canal's administrator has said the drought could wipe away $200 million in revenue in 2024. And he says they may need to build a new dam or connect the canal to another nearby lake to keep water flowing. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia.  Can you name the third largest U.S. state with the state motto, Eureka? Is it Texas, Alaska, California, or Montana?  California is your answer here. And Eureka means, I found it. Eureka. The state motto might be used by firefighters in California, quite often now they fight thousands of wildfires across the state every year. And now thanks to artificial intelligence they might have a better way of finding those fires before they get out of control. CNN Stephanie Elam has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  In California where wildfires are a constant threat, firefighters want every advantage they can get on a blaze before it becomes an inferno. SCOTT SLUMPFF, CAL FIRE BATTALION CHIEF:  While I was asleep in bed, my phone dinged. ELAM:  Cal Fire Scott Slumpff got that leg up while testing new technology in July, when he got a text message with a link to this. Video of a fire that started in the middle of the night, deep in the California wilderness. SLUMPFF:  The dispatch center there was not aware of the fire.  ELAM:  But something else was, artificial intelligence. Cal Fire in partnership with U.C. San Diego's alert, California program and its network of more than 1000 cameras across the state is using the technology to recognize a fire early on. STAFF CHIEF PHILIP, FIRE INTELLIGENCE, CAL FIRE:  The next morning that fire would've been a fire of significance. ELAM:  Instead, firefighters were dispatched immediately knocking the blaze down before it did major damage. PHILIP:  So the fires that you don't hear about in the news is the greatest success of this.  ELAM:  These cameras are the new eyes for firefighters. These two position more than 5,000 feet above sea level can see across this massive Southern California valley. And they're really adding precision to the spotting of wildfires compared to more traditional ways like this lookout station, where I'm standing with this new AI technology, they can often spot wildfires more quickly than the human eye can.  (Voice-over): Here's how it works. Look at this image. Could you spot a fire? Probably not. But notice that red box on the right side, that's where artificial intelligence has detected a faint column of smoke. The pilot program works so well that Cal Fire recently expanded it to all 21 of its dispatch centers where an official will validate the imagery to make sure it is not just dust or clouds. PHILIP:  Our goal as an agency is to keep 95% of our fires at 10 acres or less. So this tool increases our ability to ensure that we're keeping those fires small. ELAM:  And the AI is constantly learning, each time a human confirms or corrects what a detects the technology adapts.  (On camera):  Do you think that it's making a difference and how you're able to protect the population? SLUMPFF:  Absolutely. ELAM:  This technology won't replace people, Cal Fire says. SLUMPFF:  Nothing can take the place of the -- the boots on the ground. ELAM:  But can help first responders stop fires before they explode. SLUMPFF:  In my opinion, save lives in property. ELAM: Stephanie Elam, CNN, Riverside County, California (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, we finish in Muldoon Alaska where a family of bears had a Eureka moment of their own. They stumbled upon an unattended crispy cream donut delivery van with a door wide open. So mama bear and her cub went donut diving, 26 packages of donuts getting dominated, despite workers trying to scare them away. Some advice for you do not try to prevent any bearglaries like this if you see one going down. Now, it's time for me to be the bearer of good news for some folks in Moorhead, Minnesota. Today's shout out, goes to Horizon Middle School, you rock. Thanks for subscribing and commenting on our CNN 10 YouTube channel. Let's all go out and do something to make this world a bit of a better place today. Even if it's just making someone's smile today. I'm Coy and I'll see you right back here tomorrow. END230920

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up sunshine? I'm Coy Wire. This is your CNN 10, especially on a #YourWordWednesday. Follow me @coywire on Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, and put your unique vocabulary word and definition in the comment section of my most recent post. And we'll choose a winner to work into tomorrow's show. Let's go.  We start with the United Nations General Assembly in New York, also known as the UNGA. Every year world leaders and members of the United Nations or U.N. gather here for an international summit. This is their 78th session with 140 heads of state and government scheduled to attend, including U.S. President Joe Biden and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This will be Zelenskyy's first in-person appearance at the summit, since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. The U.N. has 17 big goals known as sustainable development goals. They range from ending poverty and hunger to improving education, gender equality, and climate action. All those goals and more are on the table this year. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OMAR JIMENEZ, UNITED NATIONS:  It's the United Nations meeting place for most of the world's countries from the most powerful, such as the United States, China and Russia to the smallest and most vulnerable. The U.N. has been involved in everything from assisting refugees to negotiating peace among nations. Of all the languages in the world, the U.N. uses six to communicate, (through translation) Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish.  In some combination of those six, the U.N. deliberates on global issues. For judicial matters, they look to the international court of justice, the economic and social council, otherwise known as ECOSOC deals with you guess it, the world's economic social and environmental issues. The trusteeship council helps countries become self-governed and independent while the secretariat, another part of the U.N. family tackles day to day issues that include keeping the press informed. (On camera):  Where I'm standing is one of the more recognizable places in the U.N., the Security Council. It determines threats to international peace and works to solve those problems right here in this chamber, a gift from Norway in 1952. And on top of that, this council selects the secretary general. (Voice-over):  Who is then formally appointed by the General Assembly, the main representative body of the U.N. The GA as it's called meets from September to December every year, but the world's problems don't exactly follow the calendar. The U.N. has to operate year-round. And one of the ways they're staying current is through social media and you can follow the organization in any of its official languages. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Also in attendance at this year's summit, Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi. He addressed the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Tuesday after Iran made headlines this week over a prisoner release agreement with the United States. Ahead of the UNGA, Iran released five Americans who had been detained there some for years. They landed in Washington D.C. yesterday.  In return, the U.S. released five Iranians and unpro (ph) 6 billion of Iranian funds. Republicans, including Senator Lindsay, Graham and Ted Cruz have criticized this deal. Some say it sets a dangerous precedent. In a statement from the White House, though, Biden said his administration has always prioritized reuniting wrongfully detained Americans with their loved ones. He also warned Americans not to travel to Iran and said the United States would continue to impose costs on the country. Pop quiz hotshot. In surfing, to what does the term "hang 10" refer?  Performing a trick that scores 10 points, A 10-second ride, Surfing with at least 10 friends, Hanging 10 toes over the board? Very skilled surfers can walk to the front of a long board and hang all 10 of their toes over the front of the board.  Our CNN series Champions for Change brings you stories about everyday people who are lifting humanity up. My champion is Jesse Billauer. And his story reminds us that when we don't give up, we cannot fail. When Jesse was 17, he was named one of the top 100 surfers in the world, just weeks from turning pro. But one morning he was thrown head first into shallow water and was instantly paralyzed. But he didn't give up, he helped to create adaptive surfing, went on to win three world titles, and he created life rolls on the foundation, which helps people discover and rediscover their potential that lies within. JESSE BILLAUER:  The feeling that I get when I'm on the water, and that's when I feel the most free. When I was a kid, I fell in love with surfing. By the time I was a teenager, I was on the right path to becoming a professional surfer and Surfer Magazine named me as like one of the top a hundred surfers in the country. People, they don't understand how lucky they are until something like that's taken away. WIRE:  Take us back to that day, March, 1996? BILLAUER:  And the day it was beautiful, the waves were really good. And I took off on a wave and pulled inside the barrel. And when I came out, the wave hit me in my back and I didn't have too much time to put my hands up. It was shallower than I thought. And I hit my head on the -- the bottom. My whole body just went limp and numb. And I knew I couldn't move. After that, I woke up in the hospital in this rotating bed.  When the doctor told me that I broke the sixth vertebrae in my neck and that I was paralyzed, I was devastated. I mean, like I'm 17 years old. I'm in high school. I'm about to be a professional surfer. And now I'm paralyzed. All I wanted to do was just be a kid and be with my friends. And it was a difficult time because I didn't know what my life was going to look like. WIRE:  Growing up for me, sports were my life, just like Jesse Billauer. My dream was to make it to the NFL. I made it, but in my sixth season and I had a really scary moment. I -- I hit this guy and his head came down and slammed right on top of mine. And I got this burning sensation down my neck. There was this tingling sensation, like pins and needles down my right arm. And I didn't really have any strength in it. So I needed surgery. They put a plate, four screws keeping my fifth and sixth vertebrae together.  Fortunately for me, I was able to come back, but not everyone who gets a spinal cord injury can make it out on the other side. The same as they were before. What happened to Jesse, it probably would've completely ruined most of us. But Jesse found out a way to shine. BILLAUER:  And so it took a few years to really get back into the water to surf, because nobody was really doing this before me. Started doing it more often and figuring it out. WIRE:  And Jesse Billauer is a trailblazer. He's one of the pioneers of adaptive surfing. The International Surfing Association created the world para surfing championships in 2015. Jesse's won it three times. The thing is Jesse not only got himself back up, he's now helping people around the world. He started his foundation Life Roll On. BILLAUER:  We take people with various disabilities, surfing skateboarding, and now fishing. We offer these things free to the public. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  For us, having her not in pain all the time and happy as you could see, it gets us through all the hard times. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because I never thought I could serve. And when I met you, it made a big difference in my life. BILLAUER:  It's amazing, be able to get back and to see the smiles on their face and the parents' face. And I mean, to me, that's priceless. At the end of the day when the lights and the cameras and the people are all back at their house to be paralyzed, lose that independence, that freedom, that's the real stuff. That people need to like see. Surfing and all that's easy. Being paralyzed is hard.  I don't think our circumstances truly define us because to me as I'm in a wheelchair, I shouldn't be able to surf, but I look at it like I just do it in a different way. Figure out the strength with inside you and then you can help other people. I'm Jesse Billauer and I'm a surfer. Finally some baristas at a Starbucks in River Falls, Wisconsin got an alpaca surprise at the drive through window.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KERRI HARTING, OWNER OF EAGLE EYE FARM:  Yes, I'd like a Pup Cup for my alpaca, please.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Me, Oliver, the alpaca going viral after his owner, Kerri, drove him to get a treat at Starbucks. He didn't drink coffee or even lemonade, just straight whipped cream homie. Of course, the baristas had their phones ready and the videos have gotten millions of views on TikTok.  Now back at Oliver's Farm, Eagle Eye Farms, you can do yoga with Oliver and his alpacas, you could also behoove you to not try to stretch your next leg then, though. These alpacas even got introduced to some football being from Wisconsin. I guess we could call them the Green Bay Alpakers. All right. Remember, #YourWordWednesday puts your vocab board in the comment section of my most recent post on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok with the school and teacher names too. And I'll pick one winner to sneak into tomorrow's show.  Special shout out today goes to the owls of Wake Young Leadership Academy in Raleigh, North Carolina, rise up. Brooklyn, Dr. Terry, you rock.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. It's Thursday. Or as I like to say, happy Friday Eve. We're almost to the end of the week. So let's take in a deep breath and push away all the worries. Let's lock in and get her done.  Now, if you've heard word of falling gas prices being brought it around, don't believe it just yet, buckle in because our first story might make all of you drivers out there slam the brakes. You may have noticed that lately gas prices are actually going up as high as $6 per gallon in California right now. Nationally gas prices hit their highest point of the year this week at $3.88 cents per gallon. On average, that's according to the AAA auto club, that means it could cost upwards of 50 bucks to fill her up. Even a small car. That's surprising because gas prices usually go down after labor day when the summer driving season ends. Instead, the national average is about 20 cents higher than this time.  Last year, some experts say gas prices are likely to drop again soon. And officials told CNN last week that the White House is taking a wait and see approach for now. So what makes gas prices go up and what are you actually paying for at the pump? CNN Producer, Jon Sarlin has the answers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JON SARLIN, CNN PRODUCER:  What's in a number specifically that number? The number everyone can stop noticing these days. Well, nationally right now, the price of gas as we're filming this is $4.30 cents a gallon. Here in California, where we're filming this it's even higher. The highest in the country. Right now it's $5.70 cents a gallon. So what goes in a gallon of gas?  Let's break it down. Here in California, they publish a breakdown of what actually goes in the cost of a gallon of gas. So we're -- we're going to focus on them and they use $5.19 cents a gallon for this. So those are the numbers that we're going to be using. First up, taxes. There's local, state and federal, and there's a wide variance in state taxes. The median national excise tax is just over 25 cents a gallon while the lowest is Alaska. It's 8 cents. But here in California, it's $0.51 cents a gallon.  Those costs go to things like maintaining roads and infrastructure. Then you have other local state taxes and fees that adds on and another $0.13 cents. And then there's the national gas tax that adds $0.184 cents per gallon. And this number actually hasn't changed in decades. So across state houses and federal government, people are calling for a gas tax holiday to help keep the price of gas lower.  But others are arguing that no, this is too important. A revenue source to come, then it on $0.36 cents for the distribution, marketing and profits of the gas stations. That money goes towards things like rent, wages, utilities, the cost of the pump, insurance, advertising, and then the gas station's profit. All that in $0.36 cents.  Then there's the cost of refining the gas. That adds $1.12 cents per gallon. That includes refining the gas, also transporting it and the profits for those companies. Then we get to the biggest piece of the pie, the cost of crude oil. Right now that adds $2.87 cents per gallon.  Now, this is the largest and most volatile part is what makes up a gallon of gas. When you see the price of gas going up, you can count on the cost of crude oil, having just gone up as well. All of those factors go into what you pay at the pump. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Now, it's not just pain at the pump. The U.S. faces economic headwinds, amid nationwide strikes, and those high fuel prices could hurt other sectors too. Here's CNN's John Laurence to break it all down. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID BLANCHFLOWER, ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, DARTMOUTH COLLEGE:  People are running out of the excess savings that they had. Though -- and banking, sectored loan growth is slowed. JOHN LAURENCE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  By anyone's yardstick, the U.S. economy is facing a few financial hurdles. BOBBY BRADLE, FARMER:  Input cost or through the ceiling. My risk exposure is through the ceiling. It's -- it's a risky, scary time. LAURENCE:  First, there's the United Auto Worker strike, which may soon expand. SHAWN FAIN, UAW PRESIDENT:  If we don't make serious progress by noon on Friday, September 22nd more locals will be called on to stand up and join the strike. LAURENCE:  The writer strike in Hollywood is also ongoing. AAA says gas prices are reaching record levels, affecting everyone from commuters to farmers. BRADLE:  Last year, we put out 31,000 in few. I'm scared to even imagine what it's going to be this year. LAURENCE:  New home building in the U.S. collapsed 11% in August, according to the census bureau. And to top it off Washington, D.C. has less than two weeks to prevent the government from being forced to close its stores. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  It's about time for our Champions for Change. I'm going to run like our examples for today. A group reaching out to youth, finding ways to help, including teaching values like expressing yourself, Soul Food Cypher. That's the name, whole group rhyming (ph), that's the game. And with positive influence there in schools rocking with students, creating safe spaces, talking life by using music, beats of play, jams go hard. Let their tracks tell, meet today's chance with our Victor Blackwell. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You the say they're rapping, embracing their freestyle and see just how it happens.  VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN HOST:  So, I chose this story, first, because I love the art form. I love the music. Hip-hop and rap had been the soundtrack of my teen years, my 20s, 30s and now 40s too. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Call me Gitzen (ph) oh like hell boy. BLACKWELL:  And often when we see these ciphers or we see or hear hip-hop or rap people assume that it's negative. But it these ciphers, that's not what we see. What we see is people telling their truths and sometimes they are difficult, but these are loving spaces. (MUSIC) BLACKWELL:  Alex, also know Cost One, creates this safe place where people feel comfortable to talk about what is happening in their lives and where they want to go. It's aspirational as well. (On camera):  Tell me about how you got not just loving the cipher, loving hip-hop but doing something with it? Where did that start? ALEX COLE ACOSTA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SOUL FOOD CYPHER:  I realize that there was a magic there. By design, ciphers are femoral. They pop up and then they dissipate. Why not create a permanent cipher? So, I brough some of my best friends together and we created Soul Food Cypher. We are an organization that has been around for 11 years and we look to showcase the positive elements of hip-hop culture through our cipher events and also our workshops and performances as well. So, a lot of times rap music, especially, popular mainstream, et cetera, et cetera. So, why is the lyrical content important? It's important that we change that narrative. BLACKWELL:  Outside of the monthly ciphers, Soul Food Cypher goes into schools. And this is the part that I think is the most fantastic. What I've learned also from some of the instructors is that it helps them grow as well. BUNDUKE, TEACHING ARTIST, SOUL FOOD CYPHER:  As we come through the curriculum and I'm teaching them and allowing them to express these gifts that are already inside of them, they get this feeling and it builds a connection, it builds a bond. They'll share some things that's like crazy. And it's like, dang, that's what you're going through at home? You know, and it's like, oh, can you come to my soccer game? Nobody comes to my soccer game. Bro. I used to be that kid. Like that truck is crazy to me, man. So, I'm like, I got to come back. BLACKWELL:  You get, obviously, a lot out of it as much as you give to these students. Speak to the question of why it's important to pass the art form to the next generation. ACOSTA:  We're using English language in order be able to inspire, influence. Because sometimes our voices only is the only thing we do that. But then you're reminded by Instructor Bunduke, Enan (ph), Breathless (ph), Soul Food Cypher that you have a power and that your voice matters. We are building community and we've done it before between people, and it's a very, very powerful thing to have like hip-hop church. You're going to see love and you're going to see respect, knowledge, joy, you're going to smile. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Cheese Louise. Did you hear about the champion chip in England? Not Joe average snack plate. Check out this giant chip, y'all. So big, it was dipped by a helicopter into an even bigger pile of cheese. Doritos, pulling off a stunt that snacked them the new record for world's longest cheese stretch, 49-feet. If you love nachos, I can't imagine it can get much cheddar than this.  (Foreign language). Congrats to Damu and Mr. Watson Nabisushi's (ph) class in Higashi Katsu Chika (ph) High School in Japan. You submitted the winner for #YourWordWednesday for bruit, a verb, meaning to spread or report rumors widely. Well done. And today's special shoutout is going to Chicopee, Massachusetts.  The bulldog of Edward Bellamy Middle School. We see you. Fun fact, a bulldog is also the mascot up United States, Marine Corps, Chesty XVI. Not only is he, the official mascot, Chesty was also promoted to private first-class last year.  I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. And I'll see you tomorrow. END230922

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Happy Friday, Friyay. Tomorrow is the first official day of fall. The Autumn Equinox. The Equinox happens once in the fall and once in the spring. And it marks the only days where there is nearly the same amount of daylight and darkness at all latitudes. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. And on this penultimate day of fall let's tackle today's headlines. We start with a troubling new study out of Stanford University, where researchers found that wildfire smoke is undoing progress toward cleaner air across America. Air pollution from wildfire smoke can spread for miles like this summer when smoke from Canada drifted into the U.S. turning skies in New York City, yellow. And wildfire smoke is a type of particle pollution or PM2.5 because the particulates are so tiny. They can sneak past our body's natural defenses and get into our system. If they get into your lungs and bloodstream, they could trigger asthma attacks or even heart attacks in some people. And long-term exposure can lead to deadly diseases taking months or even years off of your life.  PM2.5 had become less concentrated in recent decades. Thanks to air quality improvement measures. But this new study shows that progress has been slowed or even reversed in 35 states because of wildfire smoke. Here's CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Look around you, take a breath. What do you notice? It's hard to imagine, but even air that looks and feels clean could still be harmful. Air pollution is when anything chemical, physical or biological changes the atmosphere.  Now, the main culprit of air pollution has long been fossil fuels, but wildfires like the ones that we've been seeing a lot of lately are increasingly impacting our air quality. In fact, as things stand now, according to the World Health Organization, nearly all of us breathe air that is polluted.  What you might notice again, even if the air seems OK, our symptoms like eye, nose or throat irritation, wheezing, coughing, headaches, fatigue, dizziness, and one type of air pollution called particle pollution or PM2.5 can be especially dangerous. And that's because of how tiny the particles are. These particles can be 1/20th, the width of a human hair, which means they can travel past your body's usual defenses.  Now, I know you hear this and a lot of this might worry you, but there are also ways that you can protect yourself. First of all, just like you might check the weather before you leave the house, you should also check your air quality.  In fact, many countries now have tools where they monitor the air quality index, something known as AQI. The United Nations also has a live air pollution exposure calculator. So when the air quality is bad, you know that you should start staying indoors if you can. If you do have to go outside, try to do activities where you're not breathing as hard, go for a walk instead of a run. The extra careful when it's hot, outside is higher temperatures can increase particle pollution, but the big picture for all of us pay attention to the air around you. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. Which of these pro sports league has the biggest viewership? Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Football League, or Major League Soccer? If you set NFL puts your hands up, 82 of the top 100 most watched TV programs last year were NFL games.  Today, we are introducing a new segment where we learn lessons from a leader. We're flying with the Atlanta Falcons and Grady Jarrett today. He's a two-time pro bowler on the field and a shining light in the community as well. He's sharing some of his secrets to success that can help all of us, no matter what career path we may pursue.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Hello, lovely people. We're here at the home of the Atlanta Falcons with the heartbeat and leader of the team, Grady Jarrett. He has worked himself into being a pro bowler and one of the best defensive lineman in the NFL. Thanks for spending some time.  GRADY JARRETT, ATLANTA FALCONS:  Yes, sir.  WIRE:  With our CNN 10 family today, sharing some tips and tactics for achieving success in life. What inspires you, Grady? What motivates you? JARRETT:  Man, really, you know, especially at this point, man, just being the best I can be, you know, and then that's whatever aspect, anything I decide to get involved in. I want to be the best that I can be. And I feel like if I'm the best that I can be. I can be one of the best to do it. So I mean, as a player, you know, going out emptying to take every day, putting into work, whether it's physical, mental, you know, on the recovery side of things, just doing the things that's -- when it's time to go, I'm ready to go. WIRE:  Now things in life rarely go straight.  JARRETT:  Yeah.  WIRE:  How important do you think adversity is?  JARRETT:  Mm-hmm. WIRE:  In shaping us as people? JARRETT:  Man, adversity is inevitable. You know, it's going to come, but it's how you handle it, you know? When things get hard that shows your true character, you know, it's easy for you to be excited when things are going your way. When you know the outcome is going to be good and your favor, you just got to be ready for when adversity comes and to keep conquering and keep conquering. That's what life about. WIRE:  Now for the athletes out there who may be going through some tough times.  JARRETT:  Yeah.  WIRE:  Maybe facing a setback, an injury, a big loss.  JARRETT:  Mm-hmm. WIRE:  What advice would you have for them? JARRETT:  At the end of the day, all you can do is control where you're at right now and give your best foot forward every day. You know what I'm saying? So when you do overcome whatever you're going through, whether it's an injury and you miss some time, now you back on the field. Now you can appreciate them hard days when they come and you don't take it for granted because you know what it's like to not have.  I think sometimes people, we're so hard on ourself like thinking, you know, we should always feel happy. It's always feel happy. Always supposed to be good, but it's OK to be, you know, down sometimes, sad. Like that'll make you a weak person that don't make or like it's something wrong with you or something like that. Like you're human.  But at the end of the day, those time makes our higher times better, you know? Because you got to know like, you know, pain is inevitable. Things not going your way is inevitable. But it's always about how you react to it and overcome it. You know, you got to have that undeniable unstoppable mindset. WIRE:  That is such a powerful point, especially in today's world of social media.  JARRETT:  Yeah. WIRE:  When you look and you're scrolling through these feeds and --  JARRETT:  Yeah, you always see everybody highlights. WIRE:  Look and feel happy all the time.  JARRETT:  Mm-hmm. WIRE:  That's not real life.  JARRETT:  Yeah. It's not real life. And that's OK that it's not real life. You know what I'm saying, is I think when you look at it, like it's OK not for everything to be OK.  WIRE:  Yeah. JARRETT:  You know? And then you won't be as hard as yourself or like feeling like, you know, maybe you'll get so far left behind in life doing certain things or you got to run -- you got to run your race at -- at your pace.  WIRE:  Now for those folks out there who are striving to be great, is there a motto or mantra that you've learned along the way that helps drive you towards your full potential? JARRETT:  I want to do what I can while I can. So when I cannot, I will not wish I would have when I could have. And all that mean to me is just don't have any regrets. WIRE:  All right. One big lesson, I'm reminded of by Grady is no matter how famous or successful you get, stay humble, stay hungry, never get too big for your britches. Keep shining Grady. Thanks for spending time with our CNN 10 tribe today. I'm Coy Wire. JARRETT:  And I'm Grady Jarrett. WIRE:  And we are CNN 10. JARRETT:  CNN 10.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello lovely people. Happy Monday. I hope you had an awesome weekend. Today is the holiest day of the year in Judaism. Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. It began sundown Sunday and it ends tonight, which is why many schools are closed today. For those of you who observe Yom Kippur, we hope you had a meaningful fast.  All right, summer has ended officially here in the United States, but in Australia it's early spring and it's unseasonably warm. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology announced the arrival of El Nino, a natural weather pattern that tends to bring hot and dry conditions to the country. Experts worry that the combination of El Nino and the underlying global heating spells a summer of extreme heat and fire.  Australia suffered its worst fires in 2019 and 2020, burning millions of acres, including homes and natural habitats. The fire season down under usually starts in October and ends around March. It's a dangerous, sometimes deadly time for people and wildlife.  Already this year, bushfires have hit parts of the country and firefighters are working hard to keep up with the help of volunteer crews. There are tens of thousands of volunteer firefighters across Australia, especially in rural areas. We're about to join two of them now.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAUREN WILSON, ADVANCE FIREFIGHTER, OAKS RURAL FIRE BRIGADE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL:  When I tell people I'm a firefighter, I actually get a lot of mixed reactions. Oh, you do all that for free? What makes you do that? It really does spark a lot of curiosity in people. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Australia battles some of the largest and hottest wildfires on the planet. The fire season in Australia typically runs from October until the end of March, when temperatures are at their highest. Most of the firefighting is conducted by the Rural Fire Service, a volunteer force separate to state emergency services. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service has more than 70,000 members. ANDREW HAIN, SENIOR DEPUTY CAPTAIN, PICTON RURAL FIRE BRIGADE INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT PLANNER:  We were founded in 1939 by local farmers and local residents that needed a firefighting service in the area, and it was a bunch of guys with old trucks or trailers. Now we're sitting here in a million dollar plus facility with these trucks that are basically a multi- tool. We do flood work in this. We do fires, car accidents, house fires. WILSON:  We're coming into a family of a long line of firefighters. I believe there is that little bit of pressure. I can remember when I first told my father-in-law that I had joined. The first thing he said to me was, as long as you can operate a pump, you'll be fine. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As a volunteer service, recruits come from all walks of life and require intense training before being deployed. HAIN:  It's a huge amount of effort. A lot of hours go into training a new recruit. It's not for bragging rights, it's because they've got to go out on the truck with you. You need to be able to work with everybody from different backgrounds. You know, people that work in corporate, people that work in construction, you'd name it. We've probably got it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (Inaudible) they've come Picton 1 blue. HAIN:  The common thing is this desire to help people. So you've got to be willing to give your time to someone else for a thank you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In 2019 and 2020, what became known as the Black Summer Fires burned 10.3 million land across the country. HAIN:  We were tasked to go into property protection, but the house was in a spot that was very difficult to defend. One road in, one road out. But then you walk around this house and you look in the back window and it is a carbon copy of my kids bedroom. There's Lego all over the floor, there's posters on the wall. This family have literally bundled everything they can into the car and they've left. They don't know that there's someone there to look after their house, but you staying there and maybe putting in that extra time and that extra work is going to be the reason they have a house to come back to. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The deadly fires claimed 33 lives, including nine firefighters. More than 3000 homes were destroyed. The house Andrew and his crew protected was one of 14,000 saved in New South Wales.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  10 second trivia, which industry is behind at least 232 million tons of emissions that warm our planet every year?  Oil and gas, transportation, plastic, or tourism?  The plastic industry is your answer here, and it's responsible for the same amount of emissions on average as 50 million cars according to the EPA.  All right, if you clicked into CNN 10 last week, you'll remember it was a big week for the United Nations. The General Assembly held its annual summit in New York. While they were in the city, world leaders also gathered for a one-day conference about the climate crisis, the Climate Ambition Summit. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, SECRETARY-GENERAL, UNITED NATIONS:  Sweltering temperatures spawning disease, and thousands fleeing in fear as historic fires rage.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  This is U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. He kicked off the conference with a special sobering speech. Guterres called on developed countries to reach net zero emissions by 2040. What that means is removing at least the same amount of planet warming pollution from the atmosphere as those countries produce. He also asked countries to commit to timelines to phase out fossil fuel emissions. Significantly increase financial help so that low-and middle-income countries can move to clean energy and invest in climate resilience measures to better cope with increasingly severe extreme weather events. But you don't need to be a world leader in New York to help our planet. Some solutions start right at home.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Reduce, reuse, recycle.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Recycling is important.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Reduce, reuse, recycle. These three green habits have been part of our daily lives since the 1970s.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Recycle, we do.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The power is yours.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But it seems like many of us are still confused by one of these elements. A report from one NGOs says more than half of household recyclables end up in the trash. Think you know the rules pretty well?  What about this piece of cardboard? Nope. Does Finnish jam jar? Wrong again. This greasy pizza box? Yes and no. This one's tricky. Some local authorities accept this for recycling but others don't because they count grease as food contamination.  So it's not as simple as you might think. All these items are made from materials that can be recycled but there's a few golden rules to remember. If an item has food residue on it, then it can't go into the recycling, rinsed at first. It's the same for mixed materials like sticky tape on cardboard. You should remove it before you recycle.  When something's thrown into recycling that shouldn't be there, it can contaminate the entire system. This recycling plant in East London sorts more than 400 tons of waste a day.  DAVID RUMBLE, STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT, BYWATERS:  Contamination is where in the dry mix recycling there are things that should just not be in there like food waste for instance, electrical equipment. Food waste will just contaminate the other materials in the recycling, the paper and the cardboard and make it useless. But the other items, they can obviously just cause blockages within the complex machinery.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Luckily, there's a couple of handy tips to help you make the right decisions. So the first is the scrunch test for things like crisp packets or wrapping paper, which are often mixed with other materials. If you crush it in your hand and it stays scrunched, it's probably recyclable. If it starts to open, it probably needs to go in the trash. If you can tip the item upside down, maybe even over your head, and nothing comes out, you're good. If not, rinse it again.  With so many symbols, rules and regulations that not only differ country to country but region to region, it's not surprising that we often get confused.  RUMBLE:  There's a lot of confusion about recycling because our industry is constantly changing.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Marathons are tough. Running 26.2 miles takes a lot of training, heart and determination. Courtney Rich from Salt Lake City, Utah was nearing the end of the race, but her legs started giving out. She started crying because she worried that she was going to disappoint her kids, she said.  Well, she was totally re-energized when her 10-year -old daughter Avery jumped in to help her finish the race.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AVERY RICH:  In my head, I was thinking, I love my mom and I'm doing this for my mom and she needs it, so I have to do this.  COURTNEY RICH:  As soon as I caught Avery's hand in that moment, like any pain that I had in my legs, it felt like it disappeared.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  My goodness, poet and playwright Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once said, magic is believing in yourself and if you can make that happen, you can make anything happen. Well, sometimes we just need someone else to believe in us too. And you know what? I believe in all of you.  Today's shout out goes to the Bearcats, Mr. Bingham's class at Burlingame Junior High in Burlingame, Kansas. Rise up. I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10. END230926

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello sunshine. It's Tuesday, September 26th. Let's start with a shout out to all of our teachers out there today. Thank you for uplifting, informing and inspiring all of us. Students go on and give a fist bump, a handshake, or a high five to your teacher today. Let them know you appreciate them.  Welcome to the best 10 minutes in news, where I give you the, what, letting you decide what to think. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10.  And we start with the historic writer's strike after 146 days. The Writers Guild of America or WGA has reached a tentative agreement after marathon negotiations with the major film and television companies. This should help pave the way to end this historic work stoppage for the writers, at least. As for the actors union, well, it represents about 160,000 actors, and they're still on strike. Some shows could be back up and running soon, but as for some of your favorites, well, CNN Media Critic, Brian Lowry has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR:  When is Hollywood going to be able to get back to work? What productions will return and what can't return because the actors of course are still on strike? BRIAN LOWRY, CNN MEDIA CRITIC:  Right, this is going to happen in stages. So, some of the talk shows, which we're already talking about coming back, without writers will be back up and running fairly quickly. Things like Drew Barrymore Show variety is reporting that the late-night shows, Colbert, Kimmel, Fallon could be back up and running in early October. And then it's going to be a matter of time, you're going to need the actors, the actors will likely follow the template that the writers negotiated, but they have some issues that are unique to them. So the writers will have -- the actors will have to get their deal done. I think before you get wholesale scripted production pack to work, it's going to be several weeks, and then you start to run into the holidays. So we really don't know exactly. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. Which band has the longest running fan club?  Rolling Stones, Nirvana, Queen, or U2? At least for the world record says it's the band Queen that has the longest official club. It started in 1970 and still going strong. We will, we will rock you now with some space news with quite the rock band connection. NASA successfully landed samples from the surface of an asteroid back here on earth. The samples originally came from the asteroid Bennu and were collected back in 2020 by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft while on a continuing mission to explore new asteroids. NASA will share more details about the sample on October 11th.  Now, what does Queen song, "we are the champions" have to do with all this, my friends? Well, the guitarist for the classic rock band, Brian May is an astrophysicist and a team member for mission OSIRIS-REx. That stands for "Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-  Regolith Explorer." CNN International Correspondent, Michael Holmes will now come at us with some more meteor details about this story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HOLMES:  More than seven years ago, NASA sent out on a mission to visit an asteroid, collect samples and returned them to earth. It took more than two years for OSIRIS-REx to reach the asteroid named Bennu, which is nearly 500 meters in diameter, roughly the height of the empire state building. It circled Bennu for more than two years mapping and studying its rough terrain. Then in a brief touchdown in 2020, when the spacecraft attempted to extract rock samples from Bennu something unexpected happened. As the spacecraft swooped in to gather some samples, it landed with such force that it set off an explosion of loose materials. The asteroid surface was softer and looser than expected. Then after collecting rock materials from the asteroid, OSIRIS-REx departed Bennu in 2021, and has since been on its way back to earth. Scientists believe that carbon rich asteroids like Bennu could hold the answers to the mysteries of the origin and formation of the earth and the solar system. NASA says the asteroid holds the leftover materials from 4.5 billion years ago back when the solar system was first forming.  The spacecraft already found traces of water embedded within Bennu's rocky surface in 2018. So NASA scientists say the samples could take us back to the dawn of the solar system. DANTE LAURETTA, OSIRIS-REX PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR, UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA:  And we believe that we're, we're bringing back that kind of material, literally, maybe representatives of the seeds of life that these asteroids delivered at the beginning of our planet that led to this amazing biosphere, biological evolution and to us being here today, to look back on that amazing history. HOLMES: But the journey isn't over yet for the mothership ship of OSIRIS- REx renamed, as OSIRIS-APEX, the spacecraft will embark on its next mission to chase down and investigate an asteroid named Apophis. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMANDA DAVIES, SPORTS ANCHOR, CNN INTERNATIONAL:  Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, and Karim Benzema, some of the games' biggest names now playing their football in the league that until last year, many internationally had never heard of the Saudi Pro League. But why is it happening?  Barcelona's President Joan Laporta has claimed there are no sporting reasons for players to make the switch to Saudi. The SPL is a league without the traditional history playing prestige or status behind its silverware. According to stats company, Opta is a league ranked only 36 best in the world.  When then 37-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo moved to Al Nassr, there were suggestions he saw it as something of a new luxurious retirement destination. But he says he is determined to help it become one of the best domestic competitions in the world. And the arrival of the likes of Neymar, Benzema, Ruben Neves, and Roberto Firmino is a sure sign of intent. Saudi Arabia has the money to sign any player it wants if the players want to move there. It's a league without the financial fair play regulations imposed on European clubs with reports of Ronaldo, Neymar, and Benzema earning well over a hundred million dollars a year. Previously clubs in the Saudi league have been owned by the country's Ministry of Sport, but recently there's been a move to privatize, several of them as part of a government initiative, the Saudi Sovereign Wealth Fund known as the Public Investment Fund or PIF has taken control of the leagues for most powerful teams, Al Nassr, Al-Ittihad, Al-Hilal, and Al-Ahli. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is chair of the PIF, which has an estimated value of more than $776 billion in assets, according to its most recent filing. Critics like human rights watch and amnesty international have accused Saudi Arabia of a calculated sports washing campaign and focusing on football to, "obscure its extremely poor human rights record and its anti-LGBTQ plus stance."  But Saudi is a country that says it's been looking to diversify its economy away from oil and has seen the value of sport, particularly with its benefits of attracting new tourism and keeping a relatively young population, happy in an interview with Fox News, Prince bin Salman said he doesn't care if people call what the country is doing sportswashing, as long as it grows his GDP.  And attracting players is just the start. If this is about putting Saudi Arabia on the map, there's no better way of doing that. Then playing hosts to the biggest and best sporting event on the planet. A World Cup bid is reportedly expected for 2034. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Let me know if you've heard this fantastic story, getting a 10 out of 10. It's official, a lungfish named Methuselah has garnered the record for the oldest living fish in captivity. This scaly one was brought to San Francisco's Steinhardt aquarium in 1938 and researchers say Methuselah could be a centenarian, that's 100 years old.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, sunshine. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. And we are pumped for #YourWordWednesday. Follow me @coywire on Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, and put your unique vocabulary word and definition in the comment section of my most recent post. And we will choose a winner to sneak into tomorrow's show.  We start by heading to Azerbaijan where there is quite a bit of unrest. The country sits between Iran and Russia and it's home to a region called Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenian breakaway region that sits inside of Azerbaijan. This region has been the cause of years of unrest and war, and it was in this region over the weekend that Azerbaijan launched a 24-hour assault leading to more than 13,000 people fleeing west back into the country of Armenia.  There is currently a ceasefire brokered by Russia, but only after an explosion at a gas station inside Nagorno-Karabakh, which injured at least 200 people. Our Becky Anderson has more about the region's current conflict. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BECKY ANDERSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A mass exodus raising fears for Armenia of ethnic cleansing by Azerbaijan, a charge Baku staunchly denies. So far, thousands of ethnic Armenians have fled the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh into Armenia, a tragic journey they've become all too familiar with. SVETLANA HARAPETYAN, NAGORNO-KARABAKH RESIDENT (through translator): We've had three wars, three times we left and came back. And now we, I don't know. ANDERSON (voice-over): Last week, Azerbaijan forced the surrender of ethnic Armenian fighters in the breakaway disputed region, closing a major chapter in a conflict that has simmered for decades. But like every war, the horrors don't stop when the fighting abates. Although internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh is home to about 120 thousand ethnic Armenians who make up the majority of the population. Over the last three decades, the two countries have fought intense wars over the enclave, with a larger, more powerful Azerbaijani military ceasing increased territory. Russia, the traditional power breaker, says it's been delivering aid to the region's capital, Stepanakert, and that its peacekeepers on the ground will help escort civilians fleeing to Armenia. But despite Moscow's presence, Nagorno-Karabakh has been under a blockade for nine months. Azerbaijan-backed forces blockading the Lachin Corridor, the only road connecting Armenia to the region. Preventing the import of food and aid and separating families and loved ones. On Saturday, just days after the cease- fire was signed, the first convoy of humanitarian aid enter the region from the International Red Cross. Its members also carrying out medical evacuations.  There are still fears aid isn't reaching those who need it most, with thousands here having been surviving with little to no food and fuel for close to a year.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia.  What's the longest river in the world? The Nile River, Amazon River, Yangtze River, or Mississippi River.  There's no denying it, the Nile isn't just a river in Africa. It's also the longest in the world at 4,160 miles flowing right into the Mediterranean sea.  This flows right into our next story. The mighty Mississippi River is looking more like the minuscule Mississippi. In the Crescent City of new Orleans officials are saying that salt water from the Gulf of Mexico is threatening drinking water there. And in the surrounding region of Southern Louisiana.  How did this water battle begin? Well where river and ocean meet the Mississippi is normally mighty enough to force the salt water to stay put out in the Gulf, but experts predict the Mississippi will reach historic lows over the next several weeks after this summer's lower than average rainfall in the Midwest and a blistering heat wave.  Well, the U.S. army Corps of Engineers are coming to help to battle the ocean water from creeping up the river. They're building a levy and they're barging in up to 36 million gallons of fresh water every day into area facilities to help supply people with drinking water.  Now it is officially fall here in the United States, but we can already get an idea of what winter might look like. Let's go now to our CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DEREK VAN DAM, CNN WEATHER ANCHOR:  You've probably heard about El Nino, a natural climate pattern that typically occurs every two to seven years, bringing warmer than average sea surface temperatures to the Pacific Ocean. And consequently has a major influence on weather across the globe.  So what should the U.S. expect this fall? Some forecasts indicate the possibility of abnormal dryness in the Northwest and Midwest and weather than normal conditions in the Southeast.  Historically the wind shear produced by El Nino has meant fewer hurricanes for the Atlantic. Wind shear is the upper-level winds that tend to dissipate storm growth. However, warms fuel tropical storms. And this season ocean temperatures have hit record highs.  Therefore, despite the Atlantic nearing the peak of hurricane season, hurricane activity is forecast to remain high until mid-October ending in late November. During a typical El Nino winter, the U.S. experiences a cooler than average south at a warmer than average north. It also has the most influence over precipitation in the us during the cool months often resulting in wetter than average conditions across the Southern tier from the Southwest to the Southeast. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, we have the "incredible" story of an artist from New York city who grew up on welfare and food stamps, but spent years fine tuning his craft. And now after becoming one of the most followed visual artists on social media, he's also getting his first solo exhibit and in art gallery, meet Devon Rodriguez. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DEVON RODRIGUEZ, ARTIST (voice-over):  I grew up in New York and I've been taking the subway since I was a child. You could see anything and everything on the subway. You could have a homeless person next to a millionaire and you could have, you know, somebody with a fully tattooed face next to like a conservative guy. And to me, that's beautiful. These are like the people that I love. These are the people that I grew up around. These are the people that run society. So this is what I wanted to present. (On camera):  Excuse me, sir. I -- I drew you.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thanks. RODRIGUEZ:  I drew you.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's amazing.  RODRIGUEZ:  Nice to meet you too, bro. (Voice-over):  I was experimenting with so many different things. What I realized is that most people in society don't love art. It's just like a -- it's probably like a niche thing. So I was thinking, how could I mix that with something that most people would enjoy and make it digestible to people. So I'm mixing the drawing, but for them it's more about the humanity of it and making somebody feel seen. The shock value of it and the wholesome quality of it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I drew you. CROWD:  Oh. RODRIGUEZ:  People just love it. And they'll tell me like, man, I don't know what it is. I don't even care about art, but you, I'm obsessed with your work.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I've been a fast since I was 16 years old. I'm 24 now. RODRIGUEZ:  Maybe like six months ago, I became the most followed visual artist on the whole entire internet. Now they're going to come to the gallery tonight at night. It might give them a different perspective.  The whole show is called Underground, because I went around the world, traveling the underground worlds. And the second meaning is I feel like I'm an underground artist, because I never really had any work in any gallery or had a solo exhibition. Here from the Bronx that was on welfare and food stamps in this, you know, gate kept industry. I always felt like -- I always just felt like I -- I didn't belong.  I feel like I've been prepping for this moment since I was like 14, since I started painting for this show, I really had to show people, you know, what I'm capable of because people think that I'm just like this TikToker overnight success. But, you know, I feel like I have more depth than that. I really wanted to put all my effort so that people could see and hopefully they like it. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Let's go from underground to under the sea for today's story, getting a 10 out of tentacles. Researcher spotted a rare Dumbo octopus during an expedition in the Pacific Ocean, Northwest of Hawaii often called the Cutest Octopus in the World. These are cephalopods and those two-  elephant ear like things, well, those are two fins protruding from their mantles. They're rarely seen because they live nearly 13,000 feet below the surface. This Dumbo octopus sort of look like a friendly floating ghost as well. Thanks to light shining from a remotely operated vehicle.  How do you get an octopus to laugh? Ten-tickles.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Happy Friday Eve, it's Thursday, September 28th. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. Let's start with a random thought Thursday.  Why is it that only other people can tickle us? We can't tickle ourselves, or why is it that when we're making cookies, we bake them, but when we're making bacon, we cook them? Anyways, now I'm just hungry and I hope you are hungry for some knowledge.  Let's get to our top story of the day. The U.S. government and 17 states are suing Amazon. They allege the company has abused its position as an e-  Commerce giant and harmed fair competition. That's why the Federal Trade Commission also known as the FTC filed a lengthy complaint alongside 17 attorneys general. The FTC is responsible for enforcing laws that protect consumers like us. They're meant to prevent fraud and unfair business practices.  To that end, the new lawsuit claims that Amazon unfairly promotes itself over other sellers that use the platform. And that it puts those sellers at a disadvantage by requiring fees for certain benefits. The FTC also argues that for sellers who list products on many different websites, Amazon forces those sellers to put their lowest price on its platform. For its part, Amazon has denied the allegations. In a blog post, the company's Senior Vice President, David Zapolsky, said the lawsuit is, "wrong on the facts and the law."  Now, it's too soon to tell who will win this argument. The lawsuit could take years to play out. Elsewhere, however, potentially as early as Sunday, there is a looming government shutdown. CNN White House Producer Betsy Klein has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BETSY KLEIN, CNN WHITE HOUSE PRODUCER:  The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives are working around the clock to come to an agreement on how to fund the government before it runs out of money just days from now. And there's still a lot of disagreement on how to get that done. If they can't reach a deal before the deadline, the government will shut down.  And that means that all the money the government spends every single day on programs affecting all Americans get shut off. Nearly 4 million federal workers will immediately stop getting a paycheck. And that puts an enormous burden on many federal workers, especially those who live paycheck to paycheck.  Now, the White House has told each department and agency it's time to come up with its own set of plans and procedures detailing who's essential and who isn't.  Here are some examples. U.S. service, men and women are essential workers. So they'll keep working without pay. Still the White House' warning that a shutdown could put national security at risk. As many of the civilian workers that support them will be furloughed. And while TSA agents and air traffic controllers are all essential workers, many of them can't afford to work without pay. And the last time there was a shutdown in 2019, there were major delays at airports across the country because many had to call out sick to find other ways to make money. During a shutdown, according to the White House, the Environmental Protection Agency would roll back most of its inspection activity at hazardous waste sites and drinking water and chemical facilities, that could impact clean drinking water. And the government shutdown could also affect some of the country's most beloved treasures like museums and national parks. All Smithsonian museums and the national zoo would be closed, according to 2021 guidance. Those shutdown would not affect zoo animal care.  It's still unclear whether national parks would close, but in past shutdowns, the surrounding facilities have closed with trash piling up and toilets overflowing. There are lots of other impacts to services we all depend on. And the key question now is whether Congress can come together and reach a deal before the clock strikes midnight on Sunday, (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. Which of these is a palindrome? Fire Truck, Race Car, Desserts, Vroom? If you said Race Car, put your hands up. A palindrome is any word or phrase that's spelled the same forwards as backwards.  So entire phrases can be palindrome as well. Like a man, a plan, a canal, Panama, a man, a plan, a canal, Panama, pretty wild, right? Well, race car is a palindrome that's at the heart of our next story.  Meet Jessica Hawkins, the 28-year-old, former British carting champion and W series racer. Last Thursday, she became the first woman in almost five years to test a Formula 1 car, Formula 1 is the wildly popular sport for racing. There are 10 teams total, including big names like Mercedes, Red Bull, and Ferrari.  Jessica Hawkins is an ambassador for the Aston Martin team. That's the same luxury car brand favored by 007, that's right Bond, James Bond. Hawkins is no stranger to the franchise. She's earned movie credits as a James Bond stunt driver. Last week, she was the leading lady when she did 26 laps on a racetrack in Hungary to test Aston's 2021 car. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JESSICA HAWKINS, RACER:  It's a big moment. It's a big moment for me. It's a big moment for the team. It's a big moment for women's sport or women's motor sport, especially. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  And Hawkins said she hopes her test drive inspires more women to get into the sport. Now, for an adscititious story about someone who wants to inspire women to unlock their potential meet CNN's Champion for Change, Sophia Chang, she created a mentorship program for women of color like CNN's owned Sara Sidner. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA SIDNER, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  This is my 27th year in television news. I have reported from Sri Lanka, India, at least 15 countries. I moved to New York in March of 2022. After 14 and a half years in the field, the pivot from the field to the anchor chair was uncomfortable.  People think that I'm fearless because I go into war zones or because I go into conflict.  This is an important day, especially for the rebels. But I am afraid of failure because I grew up, with very little, that battle to survive, taught me to work really hard.  What Sophia does is she teaches you to break through that fear, to get to where you need to be. SOPHIA CHANG, UNLOCK HER POTENTIAL:  People always say, how do I start? I knew the second I met you, I'm going to invite you to one of my dinner parties.  SIDNER:  You did? CHANG:  Yeah. SIDNER:  You knew me for five seconds. And you were like, I'm going to show you New York. I'm going to show you my New York. And you're going to come over to my house.  Hey, Sof.  Gather humans like -- like flowers. Why do you do that? CHANG:  I'm a French lit. major and there was a player studied. And the most famous line means one must cultivate one's garden. I love pulling people together.  Hi, beautiful.  SIDNER:  There are lawyers and there are actors and there are professors. CHANG:  Cheers, everybody. SIDNER:  You are there as a vessel to learn and to give back. So, it's a beautiful quilt of human beings. (Voice-over):  Sophia stitched a storied career, most famously managing an A-list of Hip Hop royalty. CHANG:  That will never stop saying my name is Sophia Chang and I was raised by Wu-Tang. I was a yellow girl in a white world who wanted to be white. And then I meet Wu-Tang, and they are so reverential of Asian culture. They brought me around to a love of my culture, and therefore a love of self. SIDNER:  A self-love that later motivated Sophia to create a space exclusively for women of color. She calls it, "Unlock Her Potential."  Sophia, as a champion, she's going to make sure that you feel proud of whatever it is you accomplished. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting at 10 out of 10 is a real fairytale flight sky diver Max Manow detaching from a paraglider, then becoming the first person to pull off a wingsuit flight past the famous Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany, a wingsuits, webbed, shaped creates enough lift to slow dissent and that lift along with the force of the fall allows the pilot to glide horizontally for this Young Manow reach speeds of 124 miles per hour. And he said he's had almost 10,000 jumps in his career.  Neuschwanstein go more than 150 years ago is said to be the inspiration behind the design of the castle in Disney's Sleeping Beauty.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello lovely people. Welcome to CNN 10. I'm Coy Wire. It's Friyay, September 29th. And we're going to finish this week strong with some of the top stories from around the world, from the Plains of Kazakhstan to the south China Sea. But today's lead story starts 250 miles above the Earth's surface, aboard the International Space Station.  This large craft is the size of a football field end to end. And the living space is about the size of a six-bedroom house with two bathrooms and a gym. Women and men from the United States, Canada, Japan, Russia, and Europe live and work there while traveling at the speed of five miles per second. This research in science lab orbits the earth once every 90 minutes. For the past year, the ISS has been the home of NASA astronaut Frank Rubio. He was supposed to only spend six months there, but he had to stay longer when his spacecraft sprung a leak. He ended up logging 371 days. That's the longest any U.S. astronaut has ever spent in microgravity.  The world record is held by a Russian cosmonaut who spent 437 days in orbit back in the 90s. Rubio who has a wife and four children returned to earth on Wednesday alongside two Russian colleagues. They dropped into Kazakhstan by parachute using this capsule. After such a long space light, Rubio needs to adjust to life and gravity back on earth.  Let's go from above the earth to below the sea, specifically the South China Sea, which is a major shipping route, surrounded by countries, including China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Earlier this week, the Philippine Coast Guard released footage of bleached and crushed coral along two reefs near the island nation. The Philippines claimed China was behind the destruction and blamed the country's maritime militia. But China denied the allegation.  Moreover, China has claimed ownership over most of the South China Sea in defiance of an international ruling and competing claims by other countries. It's the latest in a long list of disputes about the South China Sea. Let's check in with Steven Jiang CNN's Bureau Chief in Beijing for more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF:  China actually claims almost the entirety of the South China Sea, which is about 1.3 million square miles based on what they call "historical proof" even though an international tribunal has rejected that. Nonetheless, they have maintained this sovereign claim and they have been able to do what none of the other claimants have been able to do, that is in the past few years through land reclamation and massive construction, turning many of this previously uninhabited reefs and atolls and islets into man-made islands equipped with sophisticated radars, airstrips and other equipment. That is really the basis of why they have been able to increasingly project a military power in this region, not only through their Navy and Coast Guard, but also through nominally civilian maritime militia. Now, we have been following the story for years, but in recent weeks and months, we have seen this flare up of publicized incidents between China and other claimants, especially the Philippines. We have seen the Chinese Coast Guard, for example, using water cannons and what Manila says are dangerous maneuvers to chase away, to drive away Philippine boats. The Philippines, of course, also accusing China of destroying a marine ecosystem in waters near its borders, but based on very deliberate actions. But Beijing, of course, pushing back all these allegations and saying the only thing that's changed recently is the government in Manila. Now they have a new president, President Marcos, who is doing the U.S. bidding to instigate tensions and to create political farce. And they're also very angry at the Philippines' decision to bring international media along to witness those encounters and saying this is increasingly a stage performance to create more favorable international opinion for the Philippines. But the underlying question of all this, if nothing changes, if the Chinese military is not going to pull out, what's going to happen if people try to change the dynamic or the Chinese behavior short of a war?  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia.  Did you know tarantulas can have pets? That's right, but do they keep mice, lizards, frogs, or smaller spiders?  Tarantulas can have a symbiotic relationship with frogs. In exchange for protection, the frogs eat insects that threaten the spiders eggs.  The tarantula in our next story blew my mind, check out a newly discovered species. Researchers on an expedition to Southern Thailand found this electric blue arachnid hanging out in a mangrove forest. They described the spider as mesmerizing with its blue violet hue that looks like sparks of electricity. Tarantulas are native to Thailand, and the researchers had set out to document their diversity and distribution throughout the country. To catch this species, they had to climb trees to lure the spider out of hollows. They say the rare blue color comes from the structure of hair on different parts of the spider's body.  Speaking of blue, our next story is about blue zones. Have you ever heard of these? Blue zones are areas of the world where people live longer than the average lifespan. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Okinawa, Japan, Sardinia, Italy, the Nicoya Peninsula of Costa Rica, Ikaria, Greece, and Loma Linda, California. They are the blue zones, five places where people live the longest and are the healthiest. But the question is why? Let me pick one of these places. And I'll just pick Nicoya Peninsula of Costa Rica. What is it about this environment? DAN BUETTNER, AUTHOR, "THE BLUE ZONES":  You know, there is no silver bullet in any of these blue zones. I call it silver buckshot, or what are they doing? Well, first of all, they're eating a Mesoamerican staple diet, or they have for most of their life, which consists of three foods. I argue it's the best diets humans have ever invented, corn, beans and squash. Anybody can afford them, high in complex carbohydrates, high in niacin, high in folate. That was about 80% of their diets. So that's part of it. Like all blue zones, they were remote from the rest of Costa Rica. They have a 30-or 40-year delay at, you know, the onset of fast-food restaurants and chips and sodas and -- and cars. You know, none of these centenarians have driven. They've walked their whole lives. It's the additive of the right diet, the right social environment, the right physical environment that is producing these extraordinary outsized life expectancy numbers. GUPTA:  Can that, what you just described in Nicoya Peninsula, can that be adapted? BUETTNER:  Not only can, but it does. You know, take Fort Worth, Texas. We worked there for five years and after five years against Texas controls, we saw a drop in obesity by about 3%. Life satisfaction went up, vegetable consumption, went up, physical activity, went up. Not because we went in and tried to convince beef crazed Fort Worth to eat more beans but because we went to all the restaurants and the schools and the grocery stores and convince them to make the healthy foods cheaper and more accessible. We got the city to adopt policies to make that city more walkable and more bikeable and it worked.  Now, is it a full blue zone like Sardinia? No, but we got them 10% to 15% of the way towards a blue zone. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is about a family whose picnic got put on pause, bear, pause. Check out this black bear crash in this family's picnic in Mexico. The bear wandered over and started chowing down on enchiladas and tacos. That is not Joe food bear. The family sat frozen just inches away. Black bears usually aren't aggressive to humans. And thankfully, the only thing this bear was after was the people's lunch.  The National Park Service says that wild animals can come to crave human food once they've had a taste of it. One interesting fact about black bears, their sense of smell is very good. They can catch sense from more than a mile away. That's why the National Park Service recommends storing food in your vehicle with the windows shut or keeping it in sealed containers. And if you're camping, never keep food in your tent. Makes sense, right? We don't need any of us becoming a burrito.  Shout out time now. There is a red storm brewing Mr. Cabana's class in Scarborough Middle School in Scarborough, Maine rise up. I hope you and everyone watching around the world. Have a wonderful weekend. Remember, you are more powerful than, you know, I'm Coy. It's been a blessing to spend this week with you. END231002

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, and welcome back to another week of awesome. It's Monday, October 2nd. And this year has been flying by -- I feel like it was September, just two days ago. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. And we start with today's latest on the government shutdown. Last week, we covered how senators and representatives were struggling to agree on how to fund the government. And if they didn't figure it out by Saturday at midnight, the government would shut down, meaning millions of federal workers, responsible for services like the military, transportation and clean drinking water would stop getting paid. That doesn't mean all these services would end. Even if the government did shut down, essential workers would continue showing up unpaid to keep Americans taken care of and safe.  But that's a lot to ask from anyone who lives paycheck to paycheck, right? Fortunately, Congress averted a shutdown, by passing a short-term funding bill, which president Joe Biden signed right before the deadline on Saturday. Biden said the bill would give Congress more time to work out funding for the year ahead. New deadline is now November 17th.  So Saturday's bill keeps the government open and takes care of aid for natural disasters. But it does not include any money for Ukraine and its war with Russia's efforts or security at our borders. And that means we could see additional bills addressing these issues in the coming weeks ahead.  While politicians in Washington, D.C. were dealing with the shutdown about 200 miles north, New Yorkers were facing a crisis of their own. The city was hit with record setting rain on Friday. Brooklyn saw a month's worth of rain in just three hours' time. And more rainfall at John F. Kennedy international airport than any other day since 1948. The water overwhelmed new York's sewer system flooded streets and buildings. Even the city's famous subway. CNN's Polo Sandoval takes us there now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Chaos in New York City as heavy rain pounded the five boroughs and the surrounding areas. Brooklyn saw a month's worth some 4.5 inches in only three hours. Knee deep water flooded streets. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Within I guess, about 10 minutes, it waste high water. SANDOVAL (voice-over):  Forcing some residents to abandon their cars and others to create makeshift barriers to protect their homes and businesses. Flooded subway stations in Brooklyn with at least 10 lines suspended. And even buses taking on water while still in service. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, my goodness. SANDOVAL (voice-over):  As they tried to wade through the floods. New York's airports weren't spared either. LaGuardia's historic Marine Air Terminal flooded. In the Bronx, the National Weather Service warning that the Bronx River reached major flood stage, with levels hovering close to 5 feet. Mayor Eric Adams declaring a state of emergency for the city. MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK CITY:  This is time for heightened alertness and extreme caution. If you are at home, stay home. If you are at work or school, shelter in place for now. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  China opened its first overwater bullet train line. It can take you to a city, 160 miles away in under one hour. The new line in Fujian Province goes along the west side of the Taiwan, straight with the trains running as fast as 217 miles per hour. Fujian province is the closest part of mainland China to the self-governing island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, despite having never controlled it. In September, China's ruling communist party stated its aim to facilitate better connectivity and integration between Fujian and Taiwan. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. Which of these is not a requirement to become president of the United States?  Be a natural born citizen, be at least 35 years old, served in the U.S. military for a year, lived in the U.S. for at least 14 years? All of these are requirements to be president of the U.S. except having served in the U.S. military, according to article two of the constitution.  While there is a minimum age to be president, 35, there is no maximum and recent CNN polls have shown that Americans are worried about the age and capability of the people who want to lead this country. But what about young voters? CNNs? Omar Jimenez talked to students at William & Mary, a public research university and the second oldest institute for higher learning in the U.S. to get their thoughts on whether age is just a number. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  How many of you think that president Biden is too old to be president again? And so why, why do you feel that way? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He does make a good president, but I just think that there is not a lot of representation for our generation in the entirety of the government right now. And I'd like to see more of that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's like president Biden capable of serving another term, I think absolutely. They should look to his legislative record and not necessarily to his -- his age or his persona. JIMENEZ:  It's a key distinction for these William & Mary students, age versus ability. President Joe Biden would be 86 years old at the end of his second-term, while former president Donald Trump is just three years behind him, a different world than those who weren't even teenagers when Trump was first elected. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I was 11, I think that happened. They don't say, go look at somebody graduated 40 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago or 50 years ago to ask them for college advice.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm just looking for a candid who's appealing, but the current candidates, Trump and Biden, I mean, they're fossils. JIMENEZ:  There are other candidates on the Republican side to choose from, but to some young conservatives, it's more about perception. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I was in 6th Grade when Donald Trump won. He seems the same as he was in 2016 as I remember him. I don't see his age affecting him.  JIMENEZ:  Some Republicans believe it can't just be about age. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They dismiss us all the time for our age. So we're not going to dismiss people on the other end of the spectrum for their age either. JIMENEZ:  If I asked you, is Biden -- president Biden too old to run? You would say don't focus on age? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Correct.  JIMENEZ:  OK.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you're in really strong, great health and you look and you're being perceived by the entire world as confident and in control, then age wouldn't come up. JIMENEZ:  The White House has maintained. Biden has more than demonstrated his fitness for the job. In 2020, voters under the age of 30 turned out in greater numbers than in recent elections with exit polls showing they backed Biden by more than 20 points over Trump.  It's part of why at Hampton University in Virginia, Vice President Kamala Harris kicked off her fight for our freedoms college tour, hoping to drive young turnout on some of the issues they care about most. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We want people in office who are going to listen to us and make changes according to that as well. JIMENEZ:  It's especially important for those who plan to vote for the first time. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I feel like a real adult. Just because we're younger does not mean that we don't have an understanding. JIMENEZ:  And to some that understanding doesn't have an expiration date. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If somebody is 80 years old, pushing 93 years old, as long as they know what they're doing, that's all that matters. JIMENEZ:  But to others, age means understanding, especially on issues like climate. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They don't have as long of a future on this planet as we do. JIMENEZ:  Hey, direct about it. Yeah. Are you enthusiastic about placing your first ever presidential vote for president Biden? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Given what he's done in office? Yes, I am happy to vote for Biden. Just wish that we had another candidate who could relate to us a little bit more. JIMENEZ:  It's a bottom line that could swing an election by the youngest of margins. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think in like all the difference.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah. I think it'll be pivotal. A single college campus could make a difference, youth turn out as maybe the most important factor in the next election. JIMENEZ:  Omar Jimenez, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is a magical landing by a sky diver in England. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAN ZACKL, SKYDIVING INSTRUCTOR:  I'm coming for you. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Nailed it, Jan Zackl now known as Unicorn Man was one of about 30 sky divers in a contest attempting to land and ride an inflatable unicorn after dropping from about 6,000 feet in the sky. Some of these skydiver were just ouch. But Jan or shall we say "Janicorn" was the main man, horn to be wild. He says he was going about 60 miles per hour when he successfully mounted up. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ZACKL:  I'm coming for you. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  I do believe it would not behoove us to try that at home.  Fun fact, did you know, unicorns are the national animal of Scotland? Giddy up, this mythical creature even represents Scotland on the United Kingdom's Royal Coat of Arms right next to the lion of England.  I'd be lying if I said I wasn't hyped for today's shout out, a storms are brewing. The storms of Owyhee High School in Meridian, Idaho. Let's go.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, lovely people. Welcome to CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news. I'm Coy Wire. And we are unveiling our winners of #YourWordWednesday on Wednesday this week, so submit your unique vocabulary word today in the comment section of my most recent post @coywire on social media. We're going to choose one fun winner to work in to tomorrow show.  We begin today by looking at the most recent trend of labor strikes in America, Auto Workers, writers, and actors were all part of unions that went on strike. The Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA which represents film and TV actors went on strike this summer, making Hollywood hit the pause button on filming. The Union Auto Workers strike was historic. Joe Biden became the first sitting U.S. president to visit workers on a picket line when he joined Union Auto Workers in their ongoing strikes against General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis. The pandemic pushed many people to ponder their careers, their work life balance and job demands. Soon, a contract for a whopping 75,000 healthcare workers at Kaiser Permanente facilities will expire. And if they don't reach a labor deal, those workers plan to strike from Wednesday to Saturday. Their main demand is for staffing shortage issues mainly in hospitals to be resolved. If not, this could lead to the largest healthcare strike in U.S. history.  So how might this affect all of us? Well, healthcare workers like pharmacists, optometrists, nurses, x-ray techs, about 40% of Kaiser Permanente staff might be unavailable to patients. They're spread across California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Virginia, and Washington D.C. We're going to keep you posted right here on CNN 10. Ten second trivia.  In what city would you find the largest museum in the world?  Harris, France, St. Petersburg, Russia, Cairo Egypt, or New York, New York? If you said Paris, put your hands up. The Louvre in Paris spans nearly 800,000 square feet and houses tens of thousands of pieces of art, including the Mona Lisa.  Now we are traveling to France where there is an invasion of bed bugs. The French government, trying to get the bedbug boom in Paris, under control. People are completely freaked out finding themselves in a tempestuous situation. Usually undercover, these bugs are being found on public transport systems, in movie theaters, at the airport. And with Paris hosting the 2024 Olympics in 297 days, city officials are on a mission to get this infestation under control before they welcome people from around the world. More now from our Melissa Bell in Paris. But I have to warn you, if you get queasy kind of easily, you might not want to see these videos you're about to see. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A nasty commute and not just for the passengers you can see. French officials say that bedbugs have infested Paris' transport networks and the wider city. The race is now on to exterminate the bugs with less than a year to go until the Olympics. From metros to high-speed trains, videos have shown them taking over some cinemas and even Charles de Gaulle airport, which is making for an itchy situation as France prepares to host the rest of the world next summer. French officials were preparing to take measures to contain the scourge with transport operators gathering this week to try to find ways of getting rid of the pests. But that's not enough for some who say the thought of sitting on a bus or a train next to the uninvited seatmates makes their skin crawl. LAURA MMADI, TRAIN PASSENGER (through translator): That really traumatized me. I'll keep my luggage closed to prevent them from getting to my home. Also, I'm not from here, so once I get home, I'll have to wash all my clothes. BELL: Paris Deputy Mayor Emmanuel Gregoire says that no one is safe from the problem because the bugs can be picked up anywhere. A recent government report estimated that about 1 in 10 French households had had bedbug infestations between 2017 and last year. There's some fumigation companies say business is higher than usual and more urgent. SACHA KRIEF, PEST CONTROL STORE MANAGER (through translator): We've had customers calling us up crying, desperate for a solution. And it's very, very costly when you have to throw away all of your bedding, when you have to undergo works in your apartment. And so you get into a sort of paranoia. BELL: And whilst bedbugs may be a growing nuisance in Paris, health experts say that they're not considered dangerous, causing merely itching and rashes, and their numbers are increasing not just in the French capital, but around the world. As people travel more and the bugs become more resistant to pesticides. An irritating problem, but not one say French officials that should pose a threat to the upcoming Olympics, their plan to stop the bedbugs biting as soon as they can. Melissa Bell, CNN Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: On this show, we try to cover a wide variety of stories, right? And we feature CNN's journalists from around the world here every day. But as part of our champions for change series, CNN anchor and correspondent, Sara Sidner recently gave us a unique perspective when she sat down to describe the emotional impact of reporting on conflict from around the world. We'll hear from her now to get a perspective on what it can be like covering some of the toughest, most impactful stories. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR, SENIOR & INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: For me, fear feels like a poison is being injected into my body.  Indeed, let's pull back a little bit. Let's pull back just a little bit. Let's just pull back. Cause we're -- I'm getting hit by some of the shots. I'm not fearless, but I work past it. I push past it and that actually makes me feel more powerful.  This is me. Like I'm not -- I don't have it all together. Like I don't want anyone to ever think that I have it all together. Although sometimes it looks like that on TV. I cover a lot of conflict, Libya, The Arab spring, Afghanistan, the Mumbai Attacks. (On camera): -- dealing with, OK. All right. Um --  (Voice-over): In the middle of it, when it looks the scariest to the outsider, those are not the times that bring out that anxiety and that fear.  (On camera): We're out in the open. We have to run. It is literally weeks after I get home. Stop it. Those are the times when it creeps in, there are definitely plenty of us that experience PTSD after some of the things that we see that never leave by the way, every now and then I'll get a flash of something. I've never seen that. You're what cohort? It looks like.  I have some of the most thoughtful kind colleagues, that I could ever ask for. People who literally will write me saying, hey, sis, are you okay? Do you want to talk afterwards? Those are really important outreach. Why am I tearing up? The -- that outreach is really impactful. Sorry. Get it together. OK. I've had a lot of colleagues who have reached out and said, are you OK? And sometimes I'm not. And I can actually admit that to them. They have been there. They have done it. And so that's been really, really, really, really important.  If you find someone that understands it is a real special relationship, find your people as I like to say. Anything that can keep you out of that loop at what I like to call the doom loop, I usually just take a deep breath in, and then I take one last sip of air. So like just, that it works for me. Like it, it makes me concentrate on my breath, because that last breath is hard. What's at your core. What you love, what you love about yourself. Those are the things that bring you back to reality. Literally time changes everything. It is a cycle and we have to go through it.  That is tear gas. Let's shut.  That's part of being human. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: For today's story getting a 10 out of 10. Let's go to Vegas, baby, to see the highly anticipated sphere, which made its debut last weekend as an entertainment venue with two concerts by U2. It cost 2.3 billion to build, what Madison Square Garden Entertainment calls the World's Largest Spherical Structure. It's 33 stories high, nearly two football fields wide and is almost completely wrapped by an LED screen. Fans inside described it like being inside a giant spaceship.  I wonder if it got really hot inside after the show, because all the fans left. Our special shout out today goes to Lee Scott Academy in Auburn, Alabama, Mrs. Cherry (ph) Walker. We see you. Every day, we have a choice to just keep sleeping on our dreams or we can get up and go get them. Remember, submit those vocab words @coywire on social and put your school, your mascot and your teacher's name in there too. See you tomorrow, lovely people, go make it an awesome day. END231004

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, sunshine. Wonderful Wednesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, where I tell you the, what letting you decide what to think.  Last to get to today, not a lot of time to do it. So let's get to it. We're going to start in China where the nation's longest holiday is underway. It's the Mid-Autumn Golden Week, and for National Day, they're celebrating the 74th Anniversary of the People's Republic. Officials say they expect nearly 900 million trips to be taken during the eight-day holiday period. That's a lot of people traveling by car, by boat, train or plane, a 15% jump, in fact, from 2019.  Now, during all this holiday travel, there will be a big boost to the economy. China's ministry of tourism predicts people will spend about 780 billion U.N. or 109 billion U.S. dollars. That's a 20% increase compared to 2019. This will be a welcomed boost. China's economy has had a sluggish year, but after being cooped up during the COVID-19 lockdowns, young Chinese folks are excited to be able to travel again. And they're sharing tips on social media about how to make the most of their holiday on a budget.  There is hope that a return to growth in China's manufacturing sector and a surge in travel during the Golden Week holiday could help the economy pick back up. China is also facing challenges in the form of a high debt, high unemployment rate and aging population and housing market troubles too. That's despite some of the measures that have been taken recently, like lowering interest rates and easing home and car buying restrictions to boost the economy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  China, the world's second largest economy is in a slump. Prices are dropping. The real estate market is in a cash crunch. The youth unemployment rate is so bad. The government stop publishing it, and some local governments are so broke. Medical benefits for seniors have been cut, leading to protests. Tough times across the country. Yet this is the Chinese economy, government officials are eager to show the world bustling factory floors, a free trade zone, and an industrial park dotted with international companies. Among the sites we saw on a state-sponsored trip to Northeastern China, rare access inside the heart of what many call China's Rust Belt. Are you able to have success despite all of the economic challenges facing China right now? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  China's economy as a whole is improving. We are confident that we can make a corresponding contribution to the general trend of development.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That confidence seems like a contrast to reality. Officially China's economy is improving based on GDP, but the rebound isn't as fast as many investors had hoped, especially in a post-COVID world.  (On camera):  The Chinese government is certainly looking to foreign investment to help jumpstart its economy. But it's also focusing on factories like this one. (Voice-over):  An effort to make sure it still churn out enough products for export keeping China as the world's factory. At the same time, upgrading key industries, especially tech to become self-reliant or even leaping ahead of the U.S. and other rivals. Needed solutions, as China remains one of the biggest drivers of global growth. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A slow in China, it's going to impact everyone else in the world. You will have the effect, of course, in demand, you will have the effect in prices and so on and so forth. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  China saw so much growth in the past. Economists say, eventually it would hit a wall. Now it's hoping some of the industries we saw here on this trip will help the nation climb over it. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia, which of these U.S. government agencies is responsible for preparing for and recovering from disasters? FAA, FDA, FTC or FEMA?  If you said FEMA, you are correct. The Federal Emergency Management Agency was established in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter. And a belated happy birthday to you, Mr. Carter turned 99 years old, three days ago.  All right, today at 2:20 p.m. Eastern time, don't be alarmed if you hear an alarm coming from your phone. Here in the U.S., that sounds a little like me or something like that. FEMA will be conducting a scheduled test of the wireless Emergency Alert System. So if you're not supposed to have your phone in class, you better leave it in your locker during that time, because those devices are all scheduled to go off at two 20 Eastern. Federal law requires the systems to be tested once every three years to help ensure that they'll be able to effectively warn the public about big emergencies. All radios and TVs will also be tested. Today's test will be the seventh such nationwide drill, but only the second time it includes all cell devices.  There have been some alert system hiccups in the past, like the false alarm at the state level that woke some folks up at 4:00 in the morning. And most notably in Hawaii in 2018, an emergency worker hit the wrong button, sending out a false alarm for an incoming missile that employee lost her job after that incident. Driverless vehicles are continuing to pop up all around the world, once just a tailpipe dream, we now have driverless taxis in certain cities, even driverless tractors, tilling farmland, but our Senior Automotive Reporter, Peter Valdes-Dapena, explores weather will ever get to a place where driverless cars are fully accepted. He says a truly driverless world might always be two years away. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER VALDES-DAPENA, CNN SENIOR AUTOMOTIVE REPORTER:  The idea of driverless cars, I think has been around since cars became commonplace on American roads. Certainly since the 30s. My favorite movie, when I was growing up was probably The Love Bug, where is this Volkswagen. That's essentially a self-driving conscious entity in an automobile. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's the funniest thing ever seen on wheel. VALDES-DAPENA:  Go back to the '64 world's fair. And you had companies talking about driverless cars with somebody in a control tower, talking to you about like, OK, take your hands off the wheel now. And we'll -- we'll take you home. This idea's been around because it just seems so obvious. Automobile self-moving, well, it should be fully automobile and -- and drive itself.  Some 46,000 people a year die in automobile crashes, autonomous cars, if they become ubiquitous, would virtually eliminate that. The thinking is since the majority of crashes are caused by "human error," if we eliminate humans, we would eliminate the errors. But let's face it, when driverless cars are in the news, they're in the news for screwing up. MICHAEL BALLABAN, TRANSPORTATION EDITOR, CNN BUSINESS:  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Up, nope, we're going on the wrong side of the road.  VALDES-DAPENA:  So the challenge is we've got machines interacting with people. Self-driving is one of the reasons that people are working so hard on artificial intelligence. You know, it's one thing to keep the land on the highway, but to actually like fully drive requires an almost human like ability to improvise.  In the years I've been covering this industry, fully autonomous cars are always two years away. And they keep being two years away. Now, when it comes, it's not going to be all at once. For example, already, we're seeing things like in agriculture with self-driving tractors, farmers can go out there and program the machine, go home, have breakfast, work around the farm. While the field is plowed by an autonomous tractor. This holds the promise of democratizing automobiles. You don't have to have a driver's license. You don't have to know how to drive. When the world gets to a point where a mom or a dad can take their kindergarten age kid down to a car and say, here son, get in this car. It's going to take you to school. Because it's one thing for me to get in a driver's car and be willing to take that risk when I can put a young child in that car. That's the ultimate test. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  A new Guinness World Record gets today's 10 out of 10 at an event that could have been an omnishambles as 219 dogs gathered in Los Angeles, California for an advanced screening of paw patrol, the mighty movie. But it was totally possum. The well-organized event set the world record for most dogs attending a film screening, the fur babies, wagged their stuff on a red carpet, posed for the paparazzi. They had to be at least one year old and sit, good doggie, for at least 10 minutes of the movie in order for its count.  Now of all the world records, I've heard, I feel like this one is fairly attainable. Could we break this world record? Could your school get together and get 220 dogs to sit and watch a movie for 10 minutes? If so, let us know. I wonder if an episode of CNN 10 would count. I'd bring the doggy treats for that.  Congrats to our #YourWordWednesday winners, the Jaguars in Ms. Cantwell's class at Jackson Middle for submitting the noun, omnishambles, a bad situation caused by a series of mistakes and poor organization. Well done.  Our school shout out today, goes to Canton South High School in Canton, Ohio, rise up. Halfway through the week, shine, bright everyone, and go out and make someone smile today.

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hello, sunshine. Hope you had an awesome weekend, pump to be right here with you. There's no mentum like momentum. So let's get our energy up, up, up, and start this week off strong. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start today with an update on the latest news on the situation in Israel and Gaza. Conditions in Gaza have deteriorated. On Friday, Israel's military dropped leaflets on Gaza's largest city urging, roughly 1 million residents to move south for their own safety. Many people there have since been trying to flee ahead of an expected ground invasion, but over the weekend, that's proven to be exceedingly difficult.  We'll hear more now about the current situation. And I do want to warn you that some of the material we're about to see might be tough to watch.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Dozens of Palestinians dig through rubble, desperately searching for survivors in the aftermath of an airstrike. More than half of Gaza's 2 million residents who live in the Northern section of the Strip were told to evacuate, ahead of an anticipated Israeli ground assault on Hamas. But leaving is also deadly. An apparent explosion Friday along a main evacuation route killed a number of people, including children. The IDF says Hamas was responsible. LT. COL. PETER LERNER, SPOKESPERSON, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES:  It appears that they have -- they've physically prevented people from moving from north to south. And also it appears that they have booby-traps, some of the roads. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Even emergency crews are not safe from the constant barrage. Hospitals in the area already struggling are now overwhelmed. AVRIL BENOIT, EXEC. DIRECTOR, DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS:  We considered it a humanitarian chronic emergency over many, many years, and now it's a complete catastrophe. RICK BRENNAN, REGIONAL EMERGENCY DIRECTOR, WORLD HEALTH ORG.:  There are major gaps in food, water, shelter, sanitation. People now are being forced into these unsanitary overcrowded settings, risks of disease outbreaks. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Lack of electricity, along with food and water shortages in both the Northern and Southern parts of Gaza are becoming very real concerns. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I am searching here under the rubble for the remains of lentils and rice. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Many who have taken refuge in a U.N.-run school, sleep on the ground, and try to comfort their families. NAEEM ISMAE, DISPLACED GAZA RESIDENT (through translator):  It's a tragedy. There's no water, no electricity. And I have no money. I'm standing here and hungry, wondering what's left. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Palestinians who hold foreign passports are also in dire straits. The only remaining route out of Gaza is through Egypt. Egypt's Foreign Minister says the crossing is open, but the roads are so damaged. They are impassable even for humanitarian aid. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, the folks in charge of the shipping industry have promised to cut down on their earth warming emissions and go carbon neutral by the year 2050. Now, too much CO2 in the atmosphere is bad in then it can supercharge the year's natural greenhouse effect warming the planet.  So going carbon neutral means the shipping industry plans to take steps, to remove the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to what it's emitted through their activities of their business. To do this, they're looking at using cleaner fuels like electric and wind power as opposed to burning fossil fuels. So many of the things we use in our daily lives are shipped across the ocean. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STUART NEIL, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGY AND COMMUNICATIONS, INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF SHIPPING:  We've gone from rowing to sail, to sail, to steam, steam, to the oil sector. And now we're moving to a new transition. INGRID IRIGOYEN, PRESIDENT & CEO, ZERO EMISSION MARITIME BUYERS ALLIANCE:  Bells and whistles that can be put on ships. We also now have wind assist technology. Our top priority right now must be the transition to the new zero emission fuels and technologies.  If you look around your home, the clothes that you're wearing, the food that you put on the table, almost all of that has come across the ocean. And at any given time, there is many as 50,000 large cargo vessels traversing the high seas.  In terms of the global pie, as we call it, for carbon emissions, maritime is only responsible for about 3%, which sounds like a small number, but it's actually -- if it were a nation, it would be equivalent to a major G-7 economy like Japan or Germany. And unfortunately, under business as usual, those emissions are predicted to at least double by 2050. Decarbonizing the shipping sector can have great benefits beyond just reducing carbon emissions, reductions in local air pollution, lots of new jobs, producing these new fuels. We also have the potential to address other issues like ocean noise pollution. NEIL: We need to look urgently at the efficiency savings that can be made, whether it's wind propulsion, whether it's bubbles on ships, hole, design, even operating procedures. And these have multiple benefits. IRIGOYEN: Of course, these new wind propelled ships are different than the olden days. And there's a lot of innovation happening in this space. There are going to be some challenges because ports may need to make some changes to be able to accept these vessels, as they come into port. It'll be interesting to see about maintenance, making sure that these technologies are safe. But all of these challenges are surmountable.  Even if we did all of that, we would only be able to reduce emissions by about 50%. Shipping has benefited for a very long time from its ability to use very inexpensive residual fuels that are essentially what's left over after oil has been refined for other purposes. So it's very polluting. NEIL:  The biggest issue is availability of zero emission fuels. There aren't any on the market at scale. And what there are, are very small amounts requiring an awful lot of electricity and the prices astronomical at the moment. IRIGOYEN:  Most commentators predict that in the future will have a mix of different fuels. As we look to the future, some people believe that ammonia will actually be a really important, scalable fuel that can actually significantly come down in cost as we gain scale.  If we can address the safety concerns in the meantime, methanol is being deployed already now in very, very small quantities. And then in the longer run, we'll probably see electrification. We'll see the use of fuel cells and perhaps some approaches that we haven't even come up with yet. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia.  How old was the asteroid NASA collected material from back in September? 450,000 years old, four and a half million years old, four and a half billion years old or four and a half trillion years old? If you said four and a half billion years old with a B, you are correct. That's how old the asteroid is estimated to be.  Asteroids are on NASA's mind, big time. NASA's Falcon heavy rocket, lift it off Friday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for a colossal journey of 2.2 billion miles or 3.6 billion kilometers. This mission is scheduled to happen over the next six years in the ultimate destination, a meadow rich asteroid called 16 Psyche, which orbits around the sun between Mars and Jupiter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  5, 4, 3, 2, 1, engine ignition, and --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A NASA spacecraft named Psyche embark on a 2.2-billion- mile journey. That's 3.6 billion kilometers over the next six years. The destination, a metal rich asteroid named 16 Psyche that orbits the sun between Mars and Jupiter. The asteroid whose diameter is roughly the length of Massachusetts will be the first metal space object that humans have ever visited. Scientists hypothesized that Psyche was formed when a Rocky planet lost its surface after colliding with other bodies exposing the metallic core. One could almost call Psyche's mission, a journey to the center of the earth. Even though it's an outer space. Since humans can't drill a path to Earth's core, asteroids like Psyche may be our only chance to visit something like it. LINDY ELKINS-TANTON, PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR OF PSYCHE, ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY:  So we're going to learn about when we get to psyche, a previously unstudied ingredient that went into making our habitable earth, and that is the metal that is now in the earth's core and the cores of all of the Rocky planets, cores that we can never visit, but cores that we want to learn about. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The Psyche spacecraft is expected to reach the asteroid in 2029 and during its six-year journey, it'll first cruise to interplanetary space for several years, then slingshot from Mars into the asteroid belt. Before arriving at Psyche. It'll then orbit the asteroid for more than two years, taking images, mapping and studying the metallic object. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's story getting a 10 out of 10 let's give him pumpkin to talk about Steve Kueny from Lebanon, Missouri, just set the record for longest voyage by a pumpkin vessel by floating in this massive 1200-pound pumpkin, a whopping 39 miles on the Missouri River. The previous record was 37 and a half miles.  Kueny had to hollow out enough of the pumpkin to be able to squeeze into it in the kneeling position with his legs folded under him. Let the gourd times roll. This journey lasted nearly 11 hours. That's what I'm talking a boat, my gorgeous people. Today's special shoutout goes to, Mr. Britain's (ph) Social Studies Class.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, sunshine. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. Thank you for spending part of your day with us right here on CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news. Today, we're going to be covering a bunch of topics from the situation in Israel and Gaza to the Korean War. We'll also learn about a girl who gets paid more than 4,000 bucks a week to play the card game, UNO. That, and more right here on today's show. We start with the latest on the war between Israel and Hamas. In Gaza, residents have been leaving their homes and evacuating south. Experts say conditions there have deteriorated dangerously with serious shortages of clean water and food. That's as tens of thousands of Palestinians attempt to flee crippling airstrikes and an impending Israeli ground defensive. And the world is not just watching and waiting, but reacting. While many are coming out in solidarity for Israel, others around the world are showing support for the Palestinians in Gaza. These protests are happening in U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., Chicago, New York. And in Europe, including London and Frankfurt, stretches all the way to Sydney, Istanbul, and South Africa.  Now, it's difficult for me to report on and watch something of this magnitude and maybe it is for you too. So on Thursday's episode, we're going to give you a behind the scenes, look at how we, here at CNN, report on what we're seeing, and we're even going to offer you some tools, for managing this type of distressing news.  To help us out, we'll have a very special guest and we cannot wait for you to see just for you here on CNN 10, where we tell you the what, letting you decide what to think. Next up, do you ever wonder about the past lives of your parents or maybe even your grandparents? Well, my friend, CNN Anchor, Amara Walker, decided to find out. She tells us how she got her father to share his childhood experiences during the Korean War. She says it changed her perception of her entire family history and her heritage. History lesson of the day, the Korean War began on June 25th, 1950, the North Korean people's army wanted to militarily conquer South Korea and therefore unified Korea under their communist regime. It was also the first war that the United nations played a part in. In fact, when asked to send military aid to South Korea, 16 countries sent troops and 41 sent equipment or aid. And Americans who participated in the action actually accounted for 90% of those troops. It was a three year bloody and brutal struggle that left millions from both countries dead, and created a refugee crisis that swept up Amara Walker's family. Here's more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: During the Korean War, it was from 1950 to 1953, the communists were abducting young boys into the communist army. My father remembers the conversation that his mother had with his brothers, and she told them to go escape into the local mountains and to hide there until the war was over.  No one knew if they were going to see their loved ones again. There was so much more to learn about his history. We all want to know where we come from, right? Technically, I can say I'm North Korean.  I grew up in Southern California and I really knew nothing about my roots. My childhood, I guess, was pretty normal. For an immigrant family, my father owned a gardening business. He moved to America in 1974 and he never had a chance to ever go on vacation. I said, hey, what's your bucket list vacation? And he is like, well, I've been on YouTube a lot. And I've been looking a lot at Alaska. Oh, then let's do it.  We were on this beautiful train ride through Denali National Forest. It was a glass car. This is a horrible photo. But this was inside the train. And I just randomly asked, hey dad. So tell me about the war. He kind of was taken aback. I obviously don't think he was expecting that question from me.  He just started telling me, he was eight or nine years old. It was pure chaos. He said, Amara, I was running for my safety, for my life in the middle of this war while bombs were flying and I was barefooted. Didn't even have shoes.  My dad escaped down towards Seoul. That's a long journey from what is now North Korea. His most vivid memory was being hungry as a child at night. Like the noise, his tummy would make. I don't think I had ever seen my father cry until that moment. You know, he was probably holding in all that pain, that he never talked about with anyone else until Alaska.  That was really a pivotal moment in my life. I understand my father so much more now. You know, we -- I used to always be like, dad, you don't ever talk you're -- you always look so stern. You're always working, working, working. You always have a goal. And now I know why. He was able to leave, come to America and build a life for himself and set up his children to succeed. He's a survivor. I will tell my children when they're of age, their roots. So if you want to learn more about yourself, ask questions. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Ten second trivia.  What board game was patented on December 31, 1935?  Monopoly, Scrabble, Candy Land, or Chutes and Ladders? If you said Monopoly, you are correct. Although the rules had been created much earlier in 1903 by a woman named Elizabeth Magie. That's a story that had been lost for decades until recently.  Now, ever since games and puzzles have been big business. And for one lucky player, the game UNO has also meant a big paycheck for her. She's earning thousands of dollars each month to play the game she loves. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LITZY SANTANA, CHIEF UNO PLAYER, MATTEL: That will be game.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK, got it. SANTANA: Yes, yes.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is 22-year-old Litzy Santana. She just graduated from college a few months ago and now Mattel is paying her to play its new game, UNO Quatro, with strangers on the streets of New York. SANTANA: You just won UNO Quatro, yay. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Her salary, $4,444 a week for only four hours per day. That's almost $278 an hour. SANTANA: My job responsibilities as Chief UNO Player include one, having fun.  I don't think you guys are going to beat me.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wow.  SANTANA: That's game.  Number two, explaining the games, the rules of UNO Quatro and then playing some UNO Quatro and hopefully winning a lot. JARED WATSON, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NYU: So Chief UNO Player as a campaign is quite fascinating. Everyone says, wow, that is so much money. It's irrational to pay an individual that much to play this game. On the flip side, not only will they have the firm generated content, they'll also have multitudes of -- of consumer generated content all for the low price of about $18,000. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Litzy isn't an influencer or a household name. She doesn't have thousands of followers, but she landed the job anyways. Thanks to an open call audition on You Guessed It TikTok. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You like playing UNO, you liked making money.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's a tactic on the part of companies like Mattel to draw on younger customers on social media.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, and you should probably be friendly and have really good vibes. Because you're going to be challenging Randalls to play with Quatro. WATSON: When we think about an influencer, traditionally, we think about someone who has an organic following. SANTANA: And why should I be the first Chief UNO Player? Let me try make a launch real quick.  WATSON: The Chief UNO Player, they were not selected due to their role as an influencer, given that they were given a title from this company, they're given credibility. SANTANA: Here to tell you and give you the ultimate scoop on how to win UNO Quatro every single --  WATSON: Consumers are increasingly skeptical of brands in the marketplace, but having this intermediary, whether it's an influencer, a creator, consumers develop what are called parasocial relationships. They treat it like a real relationship. They say this person won't lie to me. I trust this person. SANTANA: 1, 2, 3, 4. Awesome. Love it. Thank you guys. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Finally, we're traveling to the New York Comic Con known for its detailed and extensive costumes. It's not uncommon to see fans cost playing all around New York City. The New York Comic Con is an annual New York city fan convention dedicated to all things, comics. That includes everything from graphic novels to anime, popular media and even video games. The convention was first held in 2006 and its north America's most attended fan convention.  Today's special shout out is going to Mr. Hawk's class at William Cook in Richmond, B.C., Canada. We hear you watch us every day as part of your morning routine. And then write in journals about the core values of caring for yourselves, caring for each other and your community. That is incredible.  And I want to give a shout out to all the educators out there with some teacher time Tuesday. Thank you for inspiring, uplifting and caring for all of us. Students, give your teacher a handshake, high five or fist bump today and let them know, we see you. I'm Coy Wire and we are CNN 10. END231018

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, lovely people. It's Wednesday, October 18th, I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, coming to you from San Diego today where I'm interviewing absolute legend. I have to be enigmatic about it. So I can't tell you who it is just yet. But here's a clue, this person had a video game created about them.  All right, let's start this show today with an update on the conflict in Israel and Gaza. I know it's been a lot to take in, so we'll have a special show tomorrow to talk about how this war has affected people on the ground, as well as people like you and me who are watching this all unfold. More than 4,000 people have died since Hamas attacked Israel, nearly two weeks ago. Many of those deaths have been in Gaza, which is still under siege by Israel following Hamas attack.  Israel announced last week that it would cut off electricity, food, water, and fuel to the Palestinian enclave. Tens of thousands of Palestinians are trying to flee the violence. And many are calling for a ceasefire. As of Tuesday, that hadn't happened today. President Joe Biden is in Israel to show his support, but also to look for ways to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. He'll meet with regional leaders in the neighboring country of Jordan, including Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, King Abdullah II of Jordan and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. Here is CNN's John Lorinc, with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOHN LORINC, CNNRADIO ANCHOR (voice-over): As the war between Israel and Hamas escalates presidential Biden will meet with Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Wednesday, according to Secretary of State Antony Blinken. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: United States and Israel have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid from donor nations and multilateral organizations to reach civilians in Gaza and them alone, including the possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm's way.  LORINC: Blinken adds that Biden will "reaffirm the United States' solidarity with Israel." That's a stance agreed upon by the Senate's majority and minority leaders. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) MAJORITY LEADER: I will be working with the administration on putting together an emergency supplemental that will give Israel the tools it needs to defend itself. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R) KENTUCKY MINORITY LEADER: The surest way to stop violence against Israelis and oppression of Palestinians is to wipe terrorists like Hamas from the face of the earth. LORINC: The 26 Marine expeditionary unit is headed to the waters off the coast of Israel. And the Pentagon is preparing U.S. troops for a potential deployment to the country for medical and logistical support. But the Biden White House is still looking for a diplomatic solution. JOHN KIRBY, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: The President still believes even for all this conflict, he still believes in the promise of a two-state solution that the Palestinians deserve, their own state, a place where they can call home. LORINC: I'm John Lorinc reporting. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Ten second trivia. What planet is closest to earth when it passes by? Mercury, Venus, Mars or Jupiter? It might not be the closest on average, but Venus' orbit brings it closer to earth than any other planet. Our next story, though, is about Mars. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Take a flight over a section of Mars known as the Labyrinth of Night. Noctis Labyrinthus is a vast system of steep intersecting valleys. That is added steepest more than three times deeper than the Grand Canyon. Since 2003, the European Space Agency's Mars Express Mission has been closely imaging Mars' terrain with high resolution stereo cameras. The cameras have revealed information on Mars' landscape, including mapping its subsurface and even its atmosphere. Noctis Labyrinthus, this is the length of Italy and was formed due to vulcanism that stretched and cracked the surface to create the valley. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE: Whale, it's time for an uplifting tale, a tale about a tale, a whale's tale. Scientists have developed a new way to track these Marine mammoths whales are mammals. Just like humans, they nurse their young and need air to breathe, to do that. They use blow holes on their backs, producing those famous spouts that we see. And without those spouts, we wouldn't have our next story as we're about to find out it all started with a cloud of whale snot. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. IAIN KERR, CEO, OCEAN ALLIANCE: Unlike Jurassic Park, if we lose these animals, they're gone forever. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For years, scientists have been attaching GPS tax to whales in order to monitor the population's movements and wellbeing.  KERR: They have these incredibly talented groups of people in a small inflatable with a long pole, the tag at the end of the pole, and they'd get close to the whale. The problem is the whale didn't know what was going on. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was potentially loud and even frightening for the animal. KERR: The act of collecting the data, we often felt could change the data. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now, this team is trying something new, drones. But how could tagging whales with drones work?  Ocean Alliance is a Marine Mammal Research and Conservation group led by Dr. Iain Kerr, working out of an old converted pink factory in Gloucester, Massachusetts. KERR: One day I got covered in a cloud of whale snot that was smelly and sticky, and I'm like, wait a minute. I smell an idea. We started our drones for whale research program with a drone. We called SnotBot. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: SnotBot was partly funded by Kickstarter campaign featuring a purist, Sir Patrick Stewart. SIR PATRICK STEWART: Iain, what the heck is that? KERR: We're really looking for ways to collect biological data without harassing the animals. And here comes our drones. We get that exhalation and then we just drop the tag. And with these suction cups, it sticks under the back and the whale never knows. It's been to the doctor.  When we look at whale snot, first of all, we've got DNA. Is it male? Is it female? Many species of whales were hunted to near extinction. Have we reached a genetic bottleneck or, you know, are we OK? And then the tag is saying, how deep does it go? Where does it feed? How does it feed? It's been incredibly exciting because we've tagged a whale and then five seconds later it's fed. So clearly the act of putting the tag on the whale hasn't affected the animal's behavior. I was looking for a tool that perhaps could democratize ocean size. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thanks to 3D printing Ocean Alliance has been able to quickly iterate on their designs and make them easily accessible. CHRIS ZADRA, DRONE PROGRAMS MANAGER, OCEAN ALLIANCE: We're just one group. We can't go all over the world, and work with every single population of whales. The more we could reduce this down into its simplest form that would make it sort of the easiest for other researchers to adopt. KERR: When you get out in the field, sometimes I just have to stop and take a breath. What an experience. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: By being able to tag and study whales without affecting their behavior, Ocean Alliance says we can truly see how humans affect the animals and ecosystem in ways we couldn't before. KERR: Fishing, pollution, noise. If we don't understand the impacts on these animals, how can we mitigate them? (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: We're literally in love with today's story getting a 10 out of 10 from here, the nearby San Diego zoo, a baby tiger debut times two. Happy belated birthday to two Sumatran tiger Cubs who explored their new habitat for the first-time last week. These siblings are looking good, feeling good. The little tiger boy Hutan and the tiger girl Puteri are about three months old. And news of their recent birth is possum. The population of Sumatran tigers is nearing catastrophic levels listed as a critically endangered species. Only an estimated 400 to 600 Sumatran tigers remain on earth.  All right, meow, congrats to the winners of #YourWordWednesday, Mr. Dye's class at Weston Middle School in Western Connecticut submitted enigmatic to my @coywire social accounts. It's an adjective meeting, mysterious and difficult to interpret or understand. Well done.  And thanks to all of you who are subscribing and commenting on our CNN 10 YouTube channel for your shout out request today. We're showing love to those Panthers rocking that orange and black in east Pennsburg High School in Enola, Pennsylvania. I see you 717, rise up. Have an awesome day, everyone. And I'll see you tomorrow. END231019

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, lovely people. I hope you are off to an awesome day. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And for today's show, we have a special guest who's going to help us learn about ourselves specifically about our brains, our thoughts and our emotions. The current conflict in Israel and Gaza has had a deep impact on the hearts and minds of many. A lot of the images we're seeing pop up on social media, stories we're hearing in the news. They're really sad and upsetting, and the whole situation can make us feel worried, uncertain, and even angry at times about what's happening in our world. And those are completely understandable, justifiable, normal emotions to feel during situations like this, but knowing that doesn't necessarily make it any easier to deal with. So we wanted to provide you with some tools that maybe you can use for yourself or for someone you know, who maybe is having a tough time dealing with bad news. And this might help you understand or support them better, rise up.  It's a privilege to introduce you now to my friend, our CNN Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who's here for all of us. Great to have you with us, Doc. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Thank you, Coy and a heartfelt hello to all of you as well. It's great to be here for this really important topic. And as Coy said, if you've been following the news out of Israel and Gaza, chances are, you've seen some pretty disturbing images. They may be tough to process, and you may be wondering this, what happens to your stress levels when you're exposed to this kind of violence? Well, here's the truth. Even if witnessing all of this from afar, it can still have an impact on your brain.  Now, seeing a lot of these intense images and reading and hearing about violence can trigger your brain's amygdala. The amygdala is the emotional center of your brain, remember that. It can also send what would best be described as distress signals to the rest of your brain and your body that can cause you to feel jittery, cause you to feel anxious. You could have something like stomach aches or headaches or things that are not even seemingly related, but are in fact caused by the disturbing images you have consumed.  So what does that all mean? And how can we protect ourselves? I spoke to an expert who knows a lot about this. He knows about kids and coping and gave me, and I hope you as well, some great words of wisdom. When something like this happens in the world and you are consuming the news, just like all of us are, what do you do to make sure you're taking care of your -- your mental health and your mindset at the same time as being an informed citizen? DR. STEVEN MARANS, HARRIS PROFESSOR OF CHILD PSYCHOANALYSIS YALO SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: I've learned to know what the signals are, that when I feel my body responding and my sense of despair increasing. GUPTA: What are some of those signals, you know your own body well, what should people be looking for? MARANS: I think, you know, when -- when we talk about stress, it's a big word to describe lots of very specific reactions that we may not even register, except that it doesn't feel good. We may actually find ourselves sweating or feeling more antsy and -- and agitated, fidgety, not -- not able to -- to pay attention, not able to keep our -- our eyes on -- on the ball, that's in front of us.  GUPTA: What do you recommend for -- for young people in particular who want to be diligent about saying my mental health is important and I want to be proactive in taking care of it. MARANS: I think one of the first steps is to actually step back and realize what it is we share as human beings. There is strength in numbers and that when we recognize that we are not alone. We are not the only ones who are feeling upset. And our upset is not a -- a demonstration of weakness, but part of who we are as human beings. That actually allows for substituting, a feeling of helplessness with some very real, small, but critical ways of taking action.  When we're able to actually translate our vulnerability, what it is that makes us human into empathy identification with others, it actually allows us to move from feeling isolated, to reaching out to one another, to actually reminding each other, that there are normal reactions that are not pleasant, and that we are here for one another. GUPTA: Here is 10 second trivia.  About how long is the Gaza Strip? A hundred miles, 25 miles, eight miles, 42 miles? Well, Gaza is a narrow strip of land west of Israel with a population of around 2 million people. It's around 25 miles long. And only seven miles wide. That's just over twice the size of Washington D.C.  While we watch this war unfold from home, there are students just like you living through this war. In fact, CNN 10 producer, Maya Blackstone spoke with two siblings from Gaza, 11-year-old Mohammad and his older sister Afaf. More than a week ago, their family left their home in Gaza city to stay in what they hoped was going to be a safer United Nation sanctioned hotel, which was nearby.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AFAF ALNAJJAR, GAZA RESIDENT: They moved us old to like the -- the lower floors of the building. We're talking about 330, 350 people in the same place. The hotel itself, the -- the windows shattered, the ceiling fell down. The last few days of staying in the hotel, we were out of drinking water. And we were out of food. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUPTA: On October 13th, the Israel dropped pamphlets in Gaza, urging citizens to evacuate south, but that was hard to do. In fact, it took the siblings and their family three hours to travel just 15 miles away to their grandparents' place. And the City of Khan Yunis. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOHAMMAD ALNAJJAR, GAZA RESIDENT: There's a lot of stuff going on. Like the bombings they're really loud and they're really scary. Also the water cut off and the electricity cut off. And that's also pretty bad. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUPTA: Before the war, Mohammad was in primary school, the Seventh Grade, he was excited to join the robotics club. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) M. ALNAJJAR: I was like really excited because I had a lot of fun things that were going to happen. But then the war started and I couldn't really attend school anymore. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUPTA: 21-year-old, the Afaf had to cancel her engagement party last week. The war has separated her now from her fiance who is staying with his own family. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) A. ALNAJJAR: You know, the -- the -- the receipts of the engagement ring, the whole, the -- the dress. So that was -- that was pretty devastating. I still don't really get a hold of my fiance. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUPTA: CNN 10 also spoke with 12-year-old Talia who lives in Holon. That's a city in Israel, just a few miles to the south of Tel Aviv. Talia has three older brothers. The oldest is a combat engineer in the military. In fact, he was at home celebrating the Jewish holiday Simchat Torah, when the war began. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TALIA PANETH, ISRAEL RESIDENT: Instead of celebrating with him, our holiday or holy day, one of the holiest days during the year, he was called his base. He had 15 minutes to get ready. I was crying. My mom was crying. I couldn't sleep. I barely ate. Everyone, even if doesn't know someone who's dead or kidnapped, knows someone, but knows someone that is dead or kidnapped. And it's such a scary feeling. Everyone is so anxious here. You can't really be happy every day when living in Israel, you need to be scared for the life. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUPTA: Talia , Afaf, Mohammad, they are all experiencing trauma. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) A. ALNAJJAR: We Palestinians do not want any bloodshed. We Palestinians do not want any war. We Palestinians do not want any loss of life on both sides. M. ALNAJJAR: I hope that this war ends. And I also hope that maybe we could go somewhere safer.  PANETH: We are just kids. We can't fight. We can't do anything. It's not a fault or of any innocent citizen, never from our side of -- or in their side. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUPTA: We've heard from a mental health expert. We've heard from students living in Gaza and Israel. What about the people covering this war? Here at CNN, we have reporters and producers and camera people on the ground, including my colleagues, Sara Sidner, she's been reporting on the war from Tel Aviv and Israel about 40 miles north of Gaza. And she wanted to share with all of you in class, how she and her team get their stories and what life is really like when the cameras are off. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sara Sidner has arrived in Tel Aviv. She's on the ground. SARA SIDNER, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: I spoke with one of the family members of a hostage.  As those rockets were literally --  I'm here in Israel, on the Israel side of the border, covering the war between Israel and Hamas.  We're in a really important place because of the equipment that you see behind me. That military equipment there, that doesn't look like much. It looks like kind of a rectangular box. That's the iron dome, but it is probably the most important piece of equipment to save lives here in Israel. No president since 1967 has recognized --  In 2012 and 13', I lived in Jerusalem. I was here for work.  It has been pretty constant. We heard it early in the morning. But I've never seen anything quite like this, where Israel has actually officially declared war.  When you're doing coverage of a war, you don't sleep much. And it is pouring rain suddenly, which seemed like out of nowhere. And so when that happens, the crew has to figure out what to do. So they have created -- just kind of creating a big thing to cover all the cameras. And this is -- this is Tel Aviv CNN temporary headquarters. We came in from New York. Averio (ph) and I, and my photographer came in from New York. We met with a producer who came in from London. They're basically a reporter that that is not on television. Their role is to help facilitate things and make sure that everything is ready and available so that when you see me on television, all of those other things have been taken care of. So it is the best possible shot with the best possible information that we can get to you.  60 hospital beds are now filled with victims from the Hamas attack. Mentally you prepare before you get into the country as you're packing. So you have to remember to get a helmet, to get a flak jacket. You have to sort of just get yourself in a very quiet place and very much pay attention to what's going on around you 360.  There are five incoming right now. Can you guys get me my helmet, please?  You have to do a lot of reading. You have to do a lot of studying about what's going on, where things are happening, a and know a lot about the country that you are in. And I don't know about you, but I learn better when I'm there in person. And I get to see things and touch things that feel things, and you make relationships with people. I have Israeli friends. I have Palestinian friends. I have friends who have -- have left Gaza. When you get home, and you think about what could have happened, or you think about the images that are in your head. Um, the horrible things that you've seen, those things tend to stay with you for a lot longer. At least that's what I've found.  So talking to -- to someone professional, talking to your colleagues, your -- your family, it is really, really important. That's how I deal with the intense stress that comes from this.  But while I'm on the job, I'm -- I'm really focused on what I'm doing. So writing a story or interviewing someone or -- or talking to camera about what we've seen and experienced and trying to get those stories out, it helps you concentrate and it doesn't -- it doesn't make your stress worse. It actually helps you lessen your stress because you have a focus and a reason to be here. (END VIDEOTAPE) GUPTA: For today's 10 out of 10, a lesson defined calmness. When your anxiety starts to build, it's called paced deep breathing. Psychiatrist, Dr. Gail Saltz taught me to take a five second inhale through the nose and then follow it with a seven second exhale through the mouth. Those extra last two seconds of forced exhale are what actually lowers your heart rate and can immediately relax you. Do this 10 times, and it can quickly quiet your stress response.  And that's it for today's special episode of CNN 10. If there are other topics you'd like to learn more about, let us know. You can add your questions in the comments below this episode on YouTube. And before we go, today's shout out, goes to my Alma Mater, the Novi High School Wildcats in Novi, Michigan.  Thank you all for watching. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. Coy is going to be back tomorrow for a regular episode of CNN 10. END231020

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. It is Friday, October 20th, Friday. Remember what's within influences what happens without, so let's get our minds right, and make this date great.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, where we tell you the what, letting you decide what to think. We start today with an overview of the headlines around the world. First, we start here in the U.S. The House of Representatives is still looking for a new leader or Speaker of the House. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio was potentially going to be named speaker this past week, but after two rounds of voting Jordan failed to secure the necessary number of votes in the House to win the gavel.  The House has been without a speaker now for more than two weeks after former speaker of the House Representative, Kevin McCarthy was historically voted out. This means the House of Representatives remains effectively frozen, unable to take action on some very serious issues like funding for Ukraine and its ongoing war with Russia and decisions that need to be made in regard to the war between Israel and Hamas.  Also, Congress faces a government funding dead deadline in November. There has been, however, in interim Speaker of the House, Patrick McHenry, but his powers are very limited. Some Republicans are discussing though a possible resolution where his powers could expand until a new speaker is elected so that some of the major issues I just mentioned can be voted on. Now for an update on Israel's war with Hamas, the Islamist group classified as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union, and some others, which attacked Israel nearly two weeks ago, Israel has agreed to allow first aid and other resources to enter Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas through Egypt, which neighbors Gaza to the west. The hope is that first aid, food, and water can reach the innocence civilians who are dealing with critically low levels of supplies. The absence of crucial aid has sparked protests around the world.  The World Health Organization says conditions are "spiraling out of control" for millions that have been effectively trapped in Gaza as Israel controls the borders.  Meanwhile, president Joe Biden was scheduled to deliver an Oval Office addressed last night to make the case for sustaining wartime aid, to both Israel and Ukraine as public opinion regarding U.S. assistance has been mixed. We'll continue to keep you updated as these stories unfold right here on CNN 10. Ten second trivia.  In what year did World War II end?  1914, 1918, 1939 or 1945? On September 2nd, 1945. Japan signed the formal surrender officially ending World War II. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is believed to be the HMS Thistle, a sunken World War II British submarine. The wreckage was discovered in the spring. Scientists found the wreck at a depth of more than 500 feet outside the Norwegian county of Rogaland. HMS Thistle last voyage was in 1940, when it was sunk by a German submarine leaving all 53 crew members dead. It was discovered during a MAREANO Program Research Cruise examining the seabed. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next up, a helium filled floating mode of transportation. Yes, helium, just like those birthday balloons. Helium isn't flammable like hydrogen filled glimpses of the past and a company called hybrid air vehicle says they're new yet old school looking airship is perfect for shorter regional journeys that can float about a hundred passengers at a time through the air at about 80 miles per hour. And they say it's much better for the environment than conventional planes. But does it make sense? And is it safe? Let's learn more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TOM GRUNDY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, HYBRID AIR VEHICLES:  It's a fast ship. It's a high-speed rail of the sky lying at about 80 miles an hour. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  U.K.-based company hybrid air vehicles believes it has a solution for climate conscious travelers of the future. Even if it might look like something from the past. MIKE DURHAM, CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER, HYBRID AIR VEHICLES:  It's got a lot of heritage back into airships. There's no doubt about that. It sort of looks like one from some angles. So we've got a little bit of public hearts and minds to win over, but the reality is three quarters of it is standard aviation technology. It just comes in a slightly strange shape wrapper. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Airlander 10 is designed for short tool and regional journeys. It's filled with helium, which is more expensive, scares (ph) and less buoyant than hydrogen, but is also safer as it's not flammable. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's going to be about 300 feet long, longer than a 747, lift hundred passengers. GRUNDY:  Getting on board, you are going into a spacious cabin. There's lots of light coming in. It's quiet. You can open the windows. You can get up and move around the cabin. Every seat's accessible to the aisle, accessible to wheelchairs and people have more limited mobility. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  HAV Also claims the carbon emissions would be 90% lower than the equivalent journey on a conventional aircraft. GRUNDY:  Some of the early customers that have come to us have said, well, what about putting 16 people on board and taking them on overnight cruises to get people, to pass the world that are really hard to get to it. And it's done in a way that minimizes the impact on the environment you're going through. It's the very first Airlander aircraft coming off the production line. We'll be going off to do those sort of jobs in place like the Arctic or on Safari.  It doesn't restrict itself to operating from runways. All it needs is a relatively flat space and that space can be sand. It can be grass. It can be water. So we can create new connections for people, getting them closer to where they want to get to. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Despite some previous setbacks, HAV states is the only company in the world to have successfully flown this type of aircraft, and is working towards commercial production of the Airlander 10. GRUNDY:  Our plan is to be delivering at least 24 of these aircraft per year into the market from later this decade. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's story, getting a 10 out of 10, pizza man, which has its roots, dating back a thousands of years, right? Drawing inspiration from top flat breads eaten by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans, but the modern pizza, as we know it today with tomato sauce and cheese, well that comes from Naples in the 18th century.  Now get ready for a story that's as cheesy and saucey as your favorite pie. We've got the low down on a domino pizza delivery vehicle. You just can't miss. The Tritan A2 created in the eighties looks like it's from outer space and it's for sale. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is Domino's 1985 Tritan A2 two pizza delivery car. And yes, it's up for auction. Only 10 of these rocket ship like cars were ever made in the 1980s. And just a few survived today. The Tritan A2 was originally commissioned by the Founder of Domino's pizza. It had customized warming ovens in the rear to deliver pizzas around Ann Arbor, Michigan, where Domino's headquartered.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Watch out SWAT 106. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At the time, futuristic cars and space motifs where all the rage and pop culture. This Tritan for instance was built in 1985. The same year that the blockbuster hit back to the future was released.  And in another blast to the past, it was Domino's pizza that campaign staffers reached for when president Joe Biden, then a Senator announced his withdrawal from the 1988 presidential election. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- withdrawal with Senator Biden will announce that he is quitting the campaign. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The Tritan A2 boast 80 miles per gallon fuel efficiency, according to Bonhams auction house, which sold a similar Domino's car in 2019 for nearly $45,000.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Domino's pizza delivers. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Even the car's current owner admits, though, it's pretty terrible to drive and probably wasn't that great at delivering pizza, but it does look awfully cool. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  I had a pizza joke I wanted to tell you, but I won't. It's too cheesy. Our special shout out today goes to Friendship Heritage Middle School, Lubbock, Texas. We see you. Thank you to all of you who have learned and laughed with us this week. And before we send you out, we're going to take a look back at the memorable moments we've shared.  Remember, you are more powerful than you know. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. It's been a blessing to spend this week with you. END231023

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, sunshine. I'm Coy Wire. Welcome to CNN 10. Happy motivation Monday to you. Remember that there's no such thing as overnight success, the best musicians, artists, athletes, doctors, you name it, they become great only after years of study and practice. So as you pursue your greatness, remember the story of the Chinese bamboo. It's a seed that remains underground for four years, with nothing peek up above the surface until in the fifth year, after being watered regularly, it's now strong and suddenly it shoots up growing 90 feet tall in just five weeks. Let's keep growing y'all. We're going to start today with news about the housing market. It might not be the best time for prospective home buyers to get a loan, to buy a home. That's because mortgage rates are nearing 8%. A mortgage rate is the percentage of interest that is charged on a home loan. Let's break it down by the numbers.  For an 8% interest rate on say, a 30-year loan of a hundred thousand dollars the total amount you'd pay over 30 years would be more than $250,000. Interest rates changed with economic conditions. Prices have climbed for the past three months straight. And there were fewer homes on the market in September than any September ever before. No wonder home sales just hit a 13-year low.  Unfortunately, prices are expected to stay high. Inventory is expected to stay low and rates could climb even higher. ICE Mortgage Technology says that monthly mortgage payments on median priced homes are more than $2,500 up 91% from two years ago. And that housing is the least affordable it's been since 1984.  The last time home affordability was this tight interest rates were over 13% and the average home price was about three and a half times, the median household income. We'll keep you updated on the housing market right here on CNN 10.  Now pop quiz, hotshot. Ten second trivia, which of these weather patterns is a "warm phase" having weaker winds and warmer ocean water? Nor'easter, El Nino, La Nina or Derecho? El Nino, Spanish for the little boy is this irregular weather pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean.  El Nino, a natural ocean and weather pattern in the tropical Pacific might shake things up for the U.S. this winter. It's looking like some areas might get a warmer, maybe wetter winter, but for those of us who love those snowy, wintery, wonderlands, don't worry, though, we may be in for above average temperatures this winter season, we'll still get cold snaps. They just might not hit as often or hang around as long. More now from CNN's Karin Caifa. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARIN CAIFA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Winter will be wetter and warmer in parts of the U.S. Thanks to El Nino, a natural ocean and weather pattern in the Tropical Pacific. JON GOTTSCHAL, NOAA CLIMATE PREDICTION CENTER: What typically can happen when in those cases is that the U.S. and Alaska is impacted by much more air of Pacific ocean origin, which is generally warmer. CAIFA: That forecast, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA. But Jon Gottschal of NOAA's Climate Prediction Center says you should still unpack the winter coats. GOTTSCHAL: There will be certainly periods of below normal temperatures. There'll be those Arctic outbreaks. What we're saying basically is more that there may be less -- less of them and shorter duration potentially this year. CAIFA: And the snow boots. El Nino brings the potential for more precipitation, especially in the Northeast where it could deliver two or three major snowstorms. And above average precipitation as rain, snow, or icy mix that's forecast from the Plains to the Southwest could be welcomed after a summer of extreme drought. GOTTSCHAL: Overall, it could be a very much a needed benefit relief for the drought conditions that are occurring in those areas. CAIFA: Looking back on hallmarks of recent El Nino winters, the 2018, '19 season saw the wettest winter on record for the U.S. mainland, according to NOAA, and a very strong El Nino during the 2015, '16 winter contributed to the warmest winter on record for the U.S. mainland land. In Washington, I'm Karin Caifa. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Next up, a method of farming that could potentially provide us with more nutritious crops while putting more money in farmer's pockets. A lot of big farms in the United States rely on pesticides to battle pesky weeds, bugs, and diseases that can ruin crops, but they're not cheap. And maybe there is a safer way to protect the crops that we consume. CNN's Derek Van Dam went on a trip to Southern California to learn about something called regenerative farming, a method from the past that just may become the future of farming. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice-over): It was grown using what's called Regenerative Agriculture. It's farming practices, which are centuries old, but getting new life, thanks to small farms like coastal roots here in Encinitas, California. ADAM MCCURDY, DIRECTOR OF FARM PRODUCTION, COASTAL ROOTS: This is what it's all about. Look at that.  VAN DAM: Yeah, that's fertile, fertile land here.  (Voice-Over): Regenerative agriculture is a guiding principle centered around this stuff, soil and its ability to repair itself. Thanks to what's already living inside of it.  (On camera): There is more microorganisms in this teaspoon of soil from this farm than there are people on the planet. Incredible. VAN DAM (voice-over): A few hours north at McGrath Family Farm, it's plain to seat, the healthier the organisms, the healthier the crops. INLAKESH AMOR, LEAD FARMER, MCGRATH FAMILY FARMERS: And the more regenerative practice you do the healthier those organisms are. VAN DAM: These microbes are what gives soil its ability to grow food. Current methods, fertilizer, tillage, pesticides, just disturbing, the soil, can kill these microorganisms and deplete the land. Instead Inlakesh and Adam are putting life back into their farm's soil by rotating crops. So old already harvested plants become the compost to feed new plants. AMOR: How are these dead sunflowers going to become food for, for the soil, right?  VAN DAM: Right.  AMOR: So these organisms helps break that down for plants. You -- you could see like the roots of the plants are -- are basically like our stomachs and the more diversity of bacteria there is, the more organic matter, the healthier the plant is. VAN DAM (voice-over): And instead of using synthetic pesticides, Adam McCurdy is recruiting fowls. MCCURDY: Hey girls. They do a great job of eating pests (ph) and then leaving the deposit. So they're preparing the soil. VAN DAM: McCurdy is practicing rotational grazing, where he carefully moves this livestock around from one crop to another to manage soil health. MCCURDY: So you see a crop that's here. Once this is spent, we're going to bring those chickens here. VAN DAM (On camera): Your chickens are going to come and help, you know, decompose that food. They're going to fertilize the soil. In turn, you're going to create a new crop and wash prints repeat, right? I mean --  MCCURDY: Exactly.  VAN DAM: That's awesome.  MCCURDY: Exactly. VAN DAM (voice-over): Not only is regenerative agriculture better for the planet by moving away from harmful pesticides and fertilizers, but food grown this way can even be more nutritious, according to environmental scientists. It could also be more profitable for farmers in the long run. One study suggests regenerative corn fields where 78% more profitable than traditional models. It's a win-win. And so more farms and big businesses like McDonald's General Mills and PepsiCo are pledging to support and source from regenerative farmland. MCCURDY: Even those that are doing heavy tillage and grossing $200 an acre.  VAN DAM: Yeah.  MCCURDY: As opposed to intent expensive growing like this, if you're doing it well, you can do $20,000 an acre.  VAN DAM: Yeah.  MCCURDY: $50,000 an acre. So they even started to say, oh yeah, preserve the microbes in the soil like granddad used to do. VAN DAM (voice-over): But the cost to switch farming methods can be high and it's still not widely used yet. McCurdy thinks more research is needed to upscale production and start systematic change. But he's hopeful.  (On camera): Do you think that we can feed America with regenerative agriculture? MCCURDY: Absolutely. It's a holistic approach. So it's about holistic regenerative community nourishment and management. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is lit. This piece of literature was checked out of the Larchmont Public Library way back in 1933. And whoever got this book, either forgot to return it, or they were just really into it. The library just recently got a package with the book inside nearly 90 years overdue. You'd think that the late fees would be astronomical, right? Well, thanks to the library rules. The fine was just five bucks. The book is called Youth and Two Other Stories by Joseph Conrad published in 1925.  A book fell on my head the other day. I only have my shelf to blame. Today's special shout out is long overdue, Howard Middle School in Atlanta, Georgia, rise up. We see you Brooklyn. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10. END231024

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up lovely people. It's Tuesday, October 24th. Welcome to CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news. I'm Coy Wire and I am pumped for tomorrow's #YourWordWednesday. Follow me @coywire on Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, and put your unique vocabulary word in the comment section of my most recent post with your school, mascot city, your teacher's name, and we'll choose one fun one to work into tomorrow show.  All right ahead of Halloween, I've got some sweet stories for you from trick or treat trends to the tail of duke, the dog. Plus, a spicy kicker. But first we're digging into debt and deficit. Both are growing in the United States, but where do the national debt and deficit come from? And what's the difference? Here's CNN Jon Sarlin with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JON SARLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  America lives on borrowed money. That's why the term debt and deficit get thrown around so much. Let's first start with our definitions. In a given year, a country will raise money through taxes and spend money on everything that a government spends money on. If it spends more than it takes in, the difference is called a deficit. And the government has to borrow money to pay for it.  Now, this leads us to debt and not just any debt, but the debt. The debt is the total sum of government owes. In other words, a deficit is your dirty dish from last night. The debt is your sink. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  In the United States, our budget deficit has recently soared reaching 1.7 trillion in the most recent fiscal year. That's a 23% increase from the previous year. To give you some perspective, the richest man in America, Elon Musk is worth 180 billion, according to Forbes, nowhere near the U.S. deficit.  How much is a trillion dollars? Well, if you were to stack $1 bills on top of each other, 1 trillion of them would reach nearly 68,000 miles high. That would be into outer space, almost a third of the way to the moon.  So what's happening? According to a lead, U.S. economist Bernard Yaros more than 40% of the recent increase in our national deficit can be attributed to lower revenues from taxes, more spending on programs, such as social security and Medicare also playing a part. As for our current national debt, it's well over 30 trillion. Check out this interactive article on CNN's website. Writer, Tami Luhby, compares U.S. debt to snow. Starting with this small snowball in 1922, it represents 408 billion. Over the years, the debt snowball kept growing, literally snowballing passing 10 trillion in 1998, and 30 trillion by the end of 2022, as the U.S. government spent more money than it collected. The article puts that growing debt into perspective with this graph and breaks down the government's spending for the fiscal year 2022, $6.27 trillion or about $1.38 trillion less than it collected.  You can take some time to scroll through the article yourself to learn more about the deficit and debt. We'll leave a link under this episode on our YouTube channel. Ten second trivia. In addition to Halloween, which of these holidays will be celebrated next week? Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Dia de los Muertos or Labor Day? Dia de los Muertos is a Mexican holiday extending over the first two days of November. And it honors the lives of deceased loved ones.  Who's excited for Halloween? It's the most wonderful time of the fear. And it's one week from today. I'm so excited. I candy hardy wait. I'm not going to wear my mullet this year, though, if I'm creeping it real. This is one of my favorite looks. My costume this year is eerie resistible, though.  A survey conducted for the National Retail Federation shows that the top costume picks this year for kids are Spider-Man, a Princess or a ghost. And for adults, a witch, a vampire or Barbie, a majority of people said they will be handing out candy and about half planned to dress up or decorate.  The survey also found that Halloween spending could reach an all-time record high of 12.2 billion as more and more people are getting into the spirit ready to party and trick or treat in full spooktacular, free pandemic style. Booya.  Now it's time to meet another one of our CNN Champions for Change at a no- kill animal shelter that has the ambitious goals of rescuing every savable animal by the year 2025 and revolutionizing the way we treat and adopt shelter pets. That includes fur babies like duke and the new best friend of CNN's Jim Acosta. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIM ACOSTA, CNN ANCHOR:  What you doing over here? As Harry Truman once said, if you want a friend in Washington, get a dog. I was coming out of my seven or eight years at the White House. I was suddenly burdened with some extra time on my hands and I thought, hey, time to get a Dog. This is Duke. He is my rescue dog that I got from Best Friends. He was found in Arkansas. Mother was in an abandoned home. A lot of the times with these rescue animals, they're coming out of pretty bad situations.  JULIE CASTLE, CEO, BEST FRIENDS ANIMAL SOCIETY:  Traditional animal sheltering has been around for 150 years. The status quo was we don't have a choice. It's a necessary evil in our society that we have to kill these animals. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Oh, does that feel good? CASTLE:  Best friends really became the disruptor because they challenged the status quo.  ACOSTA:  Julie is a remarkable person. She started in 1996. She was employee number 17 here and became the CEO of this amazing organization. What they're trying to do is sort of transform the animal rescue pet adoption experience. ACOSTA (voice-over): Kanab, Utah this is where Best Friends basically runs their operations here in the Southwest. It's a spectacular setting and it makes it all the more welcoming and inviting as somebody who might be interested in adopting a pet. Go and see pigs and goats and horses. And we saw, of course, we saw dogs and cats. There were turtles and parrots and cockatoos. I felt like Doctor Doolittle. ALI WASZMER, DOGTOWN DIRECTOR, BEST FRIENDS ANIMAL SOCIETY:  What we do here at the sanctuary is so incredibly unique, so we are able to help animals that most other organizations cut in. These aren't throw away animals. These are precious sentient beings that deserve a second chance of life. ACOSTA:  The Arkansas facility, can you describe that? CASTLE:  Bentonville was an opportunity to reimagine you're walking into this bright, cool environment with a coffee shop and no cages. You can participate in that lifesaving in a way that's very similar to something like an Apple Store. ACOSTA (voice-over):  The Arkansas facility is important to me because that's where I got my pet from. When you look at who's going in. There, you know, you see a lot of young people. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  All right, this one. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is Ariana. She's two months old and two weeks. We've always been dog people. We just lost one and we really wanted to get another. It's -- it's like a whole experience. I think when you come in here, you just tell they want you and the dog to be taken care of. ACOSTA (voice-over):  You're trying to market this experience. Trying to transform the way people think about pet adoption that, oh, it's a cool place where you can go to pick up a pet. Back in 1984, when Best Friends got started, they tell us that there was something in the neighborhood of 17 million animals that were killed in this country. Now they're about 378,000 last year and Best Friends is the leader in that movement. They'd like to get to this place where the United States is a no-kill country essentially by 2025. CASTLE:  The benchmark for no-kill is 90%. Roughly 10 percent of animals that are entering America shelters probably are too sick to be saved. So it's that 90% benchmark that we're after. ACOSTA:  And you think it's possible? CASTLE:  Absolutely. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you showing off? Yes. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, we're kicking things up a notch. Or how about several million notches on the Scoville scale? This little guy called pepper X officially holds the Guinness record for world's hottest chili pepper. It rates 2.69 million Scoville heat units on average, and for reference jalapeno peppers fall between 3000 and 8,000 units. The Scoville scale was invented by pharmacologist, Wilbur Scoville in 1912 to measure the spiciness of peppers and chilies generally related to their capsaicin, the chemical that makes them spicy. Peppers are always so annoying. They get Jalapeno business.  It's time now for our shout out of the day, coming in hot Canon City High School in Canon City, Colorado. Go Tigers. You all know, I love this part of the show and we're about to make it twice as nice. You remember that our executive producer said that if our CNN 10 YouTube channel reaches 800,000 subscribers, I can start doing two shoutouts per show. And we're almost there. We just need not 1000, not 2000. You guessed 10,000 more subscribers. So let's go, looking forward to seeing those #YourWordWednesday submissions @coywire. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. And you are awesome. END231025

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello lovely people. Welcome to CNN 10, and welcome to Barclays Center in New York city. I'm here because fanatics, the digital sports platform is teaming up with a nonprofit Make-A-Wish, which grants wishes of children with critical illnesses. And three youngsters are going to meet their heroes today. Tom Brady, Aaron Judge, and Jayson Tatum. And I can't wait to share those moments with you soon. Remember, you can be a hero to someone too, even if it's just making someone smile today.  All right, let's get to the news. We start in Brazil where a record drought is drastically affecting waterways in the Amazon jungle. On Monday, researchers recorded water levels where the Rio Negro and the Amazon river meet and found the water had dropped to its lowest levels ever recorded. These rivers in tributaries, which means they flow in and out of lakes and streams creating the normally lush jungle ecosystem we've come to love.  Hundreds of thousands of people depend on these tributaries for fishing and transportation. And to get key supplies into their remote villages, many boats and floating houses are now left stranded. The region is in its dry season, but the Brazilian government says the Amazon has seen the least rain from July to September in more than 40 years. They say the El Nino weather pattern, which we learned about here on CNN 10 earlier along with global warmings intensifying heat are to blame.  Wildlife is also feeling the pain. Earlier this month, researchers found over 100 dead dolphins, suggesting water temperatures were the cause. The low river levels and high heat brought the water temperature up to nearly 100 degrees Fahrenheit. That's how hot, hot tubs are. These boto or pink river dolphins, they're so cute, right? Well, they only live in fresh water throughout south America. Researchers and activists have been trying to move the dolphins to cooler waters, but say the continued drought will only make things worse.  Ten second trivia.  Which of these was the last mission to have people on the moon? Apollo 11, Apollo 13, Apollo 17 or Apollo 19? Apollo 17 is your answer here. And as part of that mission in 1972, astronaut Gene Cernan was the last person to walk on the moon.  The moon has been Earth's constant companion for more than 4 billion years. And it's been a constant source of discovery for science. A new study suggests that the moon is even older than we'd originally thought about 35 million years older. And a crystal called Zircon is at the heart of this discovery. To take a step back, we know that scientists believe the moon formed when our solar system was in its early chaotic days, where rocks were colliding and our earth was forming. A proto planet called Theia crashed into earth, flinging off a large rocky piece, which became the moon. The energy from that impact created a molten lunar magma ocean that eventually became the moon surface.  Two years ago, scientists used modeling to understand how that ocean cooled and thought the moon was 85 million years younger than we'd believed. But incomes, new technology, geophysicists who studied natural resources like oil, gas, and minerals used Atom Probe Tomography that takes a moon material, sharpens off samples. And like a pencil sharpener then works like an hourglass to push those samples through a spectrometer, to see how fast they move. That speed showed that the samples were made of zircon and zircon is one of the oldest known solids, meaning the moon must be the same age, 4.46 billion years old. Those lunar samples were collected way back in the 1970s by the Apollo 17 astronauts. And they still teach us things today.  Here's more now on those incredible Apollo missions. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: 600 million people watched Neil Armstrong take those famous first steps on the Moon.  (OFF MIC) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But after the Apollo 11 astronauts return to earth, public interest in later Apollo missions began to fade.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, here's -- we've had a problem.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But the people who continued to tune in were treated to some pretty special moments. Astronauts took advantage of their unique surroundings to have a bit of fun. During the Apollo 17 mission, Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt sang their own rendition of the fountain in the park. JACK SCHMITT: I was strolling on the Moon one day --  JACK SCHMITT & GENE CERNAN: -- in the merry, merry month of --  GENE CERNAN: May. JACK SCHMITT: December GENE CERNAN: No, May. JACK SCHMITT: May. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The classic jumping photo, it may have been attempted at the last wedding you attended.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Come on out here, give me your photos. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, during the Apollo 16 mission, astronaut Charles Duke captured John Young in Mida (ph) while saluting to the flag. CHARLES DUKE, ASTRONAUT: OK, here we go, a big one. Off the ground one mor. There we go. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's since gone down as one of the most famous Apollo photos ever taken.  When they weren't taking epic pictures, Duke and Young got to drive around in a Luna Rover. The electric buggies were used on the last Apollo missions, 15, 16, and 17, and provided astronauts a fast way to cover large distances, helping them make more scientific discoveries than they could on foot, or just to do a bit of joy riding. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I thought the ride was real sporty. It bounced a lot. Sometimes both front wheels were off the surface. The back end is like driving on ice and breaking loose occasionally, but it was a lot of fun. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Back in the 16th Century, Galileo taught his students that objects fall at the same rate regardless of their size or mass. That is if they're not restricted by any resistance from the air. DAVID SCOTT, APOLLO 15 COMMANDER: Well, in my left hand, I have a -- a feather. In my right hand, a hammer. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, since the moon has virtually no air to breathe Apollo 15 commander David Scott decided to test this experiment by dropping a feather and a hammer from the same height, low and behold, they did in fact hit the ground at the same time. SCOTT: How about that? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And just for a little fun, Alan Shepard brought the head of a 6-iron and a couple of golf balls aboard Apollo 14. The head was modified so he could attach it to an instrument that collected rock samples. (OFF MIC) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That should have gone probably on the earth, maybe 30, 35 yards. But that little rascal went over 200 yards of a one hand shot like that. And it was in the air. The time of flight was almost 35 seconds. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Perhaps the most enduring images are the ones when the astronauts actually looked back at earth, this one taken on Apollo 17. The last time man was on the moon. It's known simply as the Blue Marble. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Today's story, getting a 10 out to 10, if you still got pumpkins to carve, don't reach for that kitchen knife just yet. Did you know that around half of all Halloween related injuries come from our creativity gone wrong since pumpkin carving catastrophes can be a quotidian experience this time of year. We have a couple of tips just for you. Check it out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOSEPH GALBO, U.S. CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION: Probably the most surprising stat around Halloween related injuries is that almost half of the injuries are related to pumpkin carving.  So now I'm going to show you how to carve a pumpkin safely. First tip, we want to make sure you're carving your pumpkin on a firm flat surface. So we're just going to make sure this table is nice and firm, which it is. A lot of people carve their pumpkins at home on kitchen tables. If your kitchen table's wobbly, for any reason, you don't feel like fixing your kitchen table, which I totally get, try a work bench or really a kitchen one.  Now, a lot of people think, oh, this is a great pumpkin carving tool because it's rigid, it's short. It's easy to hold in your hand. The problem is, as you're stabbing it into the pumpkin, your hand can slip. And we do see a lot of injuries happening in that way.  So this is an actual saw. Probably not the best thing to use if you're carving a pumpkin with kids. Then we start getting into some of what I like to refer to as the death or danger zone of pumpkin carving. And we're not going to recommend you ever use scissors to carve a pumpkin. You should never be carving a pumpkin with a razor blade. You should definitely never be carving a pumpkin with a giant carving knife.  Use the proper carving tool. So here we have our carving kit. This is the exact type of tool we want to see people using. You could run it across your fingers. Nothing's going to happen to you. But look how well it cuts a pumpkin. Doesn't get any better or easier than that. We're going to keep it classic today, because my skill level is 4 out to 10. So we will be doing the classic Jack O' Lanterns. On the safety pumpkin carving scale, I'm out to 10, 100% out to 10. You always want to make sure you're carving away from yourself as opposed to towards yourself. And that way, no matter where anyone is standing, you're cutting in a safe direction with a safe blade. No one's going to go to the emergency room. You know, save yourself like a thousand bucks or something. The ER is so expensive these days.  We never want to see people using real fire, real candles in their pumpkins. We won't start a fire here at CNN either. That's can knock them off the tables, kids can bump into them. Somebody's costume can get a little bit too close. This is perfect. It blinks. So make sure you use an LED light in your pumpkin and everybody will have a great safe, happy Halloween. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: All right, thanks to the Patriots in Ms. Ryan's class at Hazel Park in Michigan. You submitted the winner of #YourWordWednesday. Quotidian, an adjective, meaning occurring daily or ordinary and every day. Well done.  Our special shout out today is going to the Wolves of Lake Ridge Middle School in Woodbridge, Virginia, rise up. Thanks for spending part of your day with us right here on CNN 10. We'll see you tomorrow. END231026

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening. Wherever you are in this world. Let's go ahead and smell of flowers and cool the soup. Get our minds right, so we can dominate this day. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news.  We start today with news of the new speaker of the house. Republican Congressman Mike Johnson was voted in on Wednesday becoming the 56th speaker of the House in U.S. history. He represents the Fourth District of Louisiana, serves on the Judiciary and Armed Services Committee. He has a solidly conservative voting record. He also supported efforts to overturn the 2020 election.  The House of Representatives had effectively been on pause for 22 straight days without a speaker. After Kevin McCarthy was historically voted out of the position. There were three unsuccessful votes to find a replacement. But now the House can get back to work. One of Speaker Johnson's first big challenges will be to pass a spending bill, as without one the government will run out of money on November 17th.  Speaker Mike Johnson is now third in line for the presidency of the United States behind President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.  Our other top story of the day takes us to Acapulco, Mexico, a major tourist destination and home to some 800,000 people. Residents are now enduring Hurricane Otis, the strongest storm on record to hit this area of Southern Mexico.  Wednesday morning, Hurricane Otis began as a tropical storm, but accelerated to a Category 5 in just 12 hours' time. The storm's rapid intensification was among the fastest on record. That burst of power gave people a little time to prepare. When we produced this show, the impact of the storm was not yet clear, but reports had indicated that the storm had knocked out all communication. For the latest on this storm, you can head to CNN.com. Ten second trivia. Yamoussoukro and Abidjan are two capital sites of what African nation? Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Rwanda, or Gabon? Officially the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire Ivory Coast is your answer here.  We take you now to Ivory Coast, a country in West Africa, between Ghana and Liberia. It is the world's top cocoa producing nation, as well as the top cashew producing nation. And it has one of the fastest growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. But the Southern City of Abidjan is dealing with a problem. Trash is piling up, especially plastic. We're about to learn why and how some locals and creative business leaders are finding ways to use that trash to make and save some cash. CNN's Zain Asher has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAIN ASHER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: On the edge of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast, waste is being dumped every day. Most of it, plastic. Hundreds of workers in the country have long collected waste to sell on the informal market. But now informal workers like Martine San say the process is being formalized through industrialized recycling circuits, where she's guaranteed around 16 cents per kilogram. MARTINE SAN, PLASTIC WASTE COLLECTOR (through translator): We used to collect waste without knowing who we could sell it to. There were no real outlets, but since we've started with this structure, things are better. We are always paid within the week for what we bring back. Since we have this structure, I have enough money to pay for my children's school and to feed my family. Sometime I even manage to save a little. ASHER: Experts, say the move towards formalizing a circular economy for waste in the Ivory Coast benefits the economy at large. According to UNICEF, only 5% of Abidjan's waste is currently recycled. KOPIEU GOUGANOU, INSTITUTE OF CIRCULAR ECONOMY ABIDJAN: In the last few years, it's developed to the point where we produce fuel from recycled plastic. There are young startup that have launched this, and it's something to promote. With plastic, we can also make furniture or tables and benches for school children. The trash that used to cause us problems must now be seen as a local opportunity. ASHER: From fuel to furniture entrepreneurs across the country are finding the best ways to utilize plastic trash. One Columbian company, Conceptos Plasticos has that big on building the circular economy in the Ivory Coast. They've built entire schools out of recycled plastic bricks saying the bricks are 40% cheaper than traditional building materials and are more solid. 30 employees at the company's Abidjan plant sort, crush, mix and transform plastic into these bricks. Selling them primarily to programs, run through NGOs like UNICEF. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our business is not to sell bricks. Our business is to have innovative solutions around circular economy. ASHER: Even though Africa only produces around 5% of the world's plastic, it's the continent that's most affected by plastic waste. Until 2017, Asia was the primary destination for the world's plastic waste, largely generated by Western countries. But many Asian countries began taking action against imported plastic.  In the Ivory Coast, the production import and marketing of plastic bags has been banned since 2013, though, the application of the law has been hard to enforce. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: On Tuesday, dozens of states from California to Georgia to Maine filed a lawsuit against Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram and all of our students out there today are at the heart of this case. The state attorney's general say that Meta is contributing to an adolescent mental health crisis, arguing that the company designed Facebook and Instagram to be addictive. They say these platforms give the, "false promise that meaningful social connection lies in the next story, image, or video and that ignoring the next piece of social content could lead to social isolation."  Now, Meta issued a statement saying it has over 30 tools to support teens and their families, and that they're willing to work with agencies to improve the user experience. But Meta, along with other social media companies like Snapchat and TikTok are infer more legal battles as they face dozens of similar lawsuits from states like Florida and hundreds more from private individuals. That's the what, we'll let you decide what to think.  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is emblematic of teamwork makes the dream work. Exhibit A, these are starlings swarming, each individual bird sinking its movements with the others, creating a mesmerizing display of poetry in motion ornithologist, scientists who study birds believe the patterns they create help the birds confuse and allude predators. Well, these patterns inspired the drone operating artists in our next story to light up the nighttime sky above central park this past weekend. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RALPH NAUTA, DRIFT CO-FOUNDER: We started our studio in 2007. We were studying bird behavior at the time. Immediately, we thought, how cool would it be if we would take that movement of birds, but have it tangible in the sky. And that merged into what you see behind us.  So behind us, you see a thousand drones in their docking stations. Every box has like six drones. It looks kind of like your basic drone, but it's specifically developed for this application. LONNEKE GORDIJN, DRIFT CO-FOUNDER: Today, we're flying a thousand drones. It's the biggest performance that we have done so far. And we were so happy to secure the first permit ever in Central Park to fly drones. This is one system, it's thousand drones that's that all are connected. And -- and with one press on the bottom, they come in the air.  Really our goal to bring people with lots of different backgrounds and different moments in their life together in this moment. And that everyone relaxes and gets tuned into the same frequency. The art piece is called Franchise Freedom. It's for us to understand that in society, we have to make sacrifices to function together as a social structure. If you look at birds swarms, you know, in our mind, it's this most free flying beautiful organic shape, but in reality, it's really like based on very specific rules. For me, that is what this swarm represents. It's this collective body of individuals functioning as a group to be the most sufficient, beautiful outcome of multiple cultures and different people coming together to be the best version of itself. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Shout out to all of our bright shining lights out there. You know, American poet, Henry David Thoreau once said, it's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see. Let's make it a great Thursday. Or as we like to say, Happy Friday Eve. Today's shoutout is going to the Jaguars at Blue Springs South High School in blue Springs, Missouri, rise up. I'm Coy Wire.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up lovely people. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, pump to be here with you today. It's Friday, rise up. We've learned and laughed together this week. Now let's lock in and finish this week strong.  We start today with an update out of Mexico, where residents are dealing with devastating damage caused by Wednesday's Category 5 storm Hurricane Otis. Trees were uprooted, buildings smashed, roadways were blanketed under several feet of water. Thankfully Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said, there were, as of Thursday morning, no casualties reported.  The local power utility says nearly 500,000 homes and businesses lost power though. And communication lines are down, making it hard for authorities and rescue operations to get a handle on the true extent of the damage. Video we have shows widespread destruction with a big impact to the local economy.  Acapulco located on the Southwestern coast of Mexico was once considered the Pearl of the Pacific in the 1940s and 50s. It was a major American vacation destination for tourists and celebrities alike like Rita Hayworth. But it diminished slowly over time due to overcrowding and crime. However, its tourism industry has been on an upswing hosting, Mexican and European travelers recently. To protect this city, residents and authorities laid major preparations ahead of the storm. But as we mentioned in yesterday's show, the storm quickly turned brutal very, very quickly and even caught meteorologists off guard. Let's turn now to our own meteorologist Derek Van Dam. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DEREK VAN DAM, CNN WEATHER ANCHOR:  The storm struck in the dead of night. It gave very little warning, very few weather models that meteorologists looked to actually picked up on the rapid intensification that it actually went through. In a 24-hour period, it was impressive. It took advantage of a very narrow swath of ocean water temperatures at about 88 degrees Fahrenheit. And that's significant because four rapid intensification to carry on, it actually needs to be 80 degrees or higher. And it found just that water and strengthened rapidly 165 miles per hour. This is the first Category 5 landfall to impact, the Eastern Pacific. The strongest storm to strike the Pacific coastline of Mexico and the fastest 12-hour rapid intensification for this area. It is that 12-hour window where it rewrote the history books rapidly intensifying by 90 miles per hour. But the overall picture in a 24-hour period, 115 mile per strengthening, that is incredible mind boggling to be quite honest. Acapulco, not only a tourist destination, but it has a residency of about 1 million people. So with a direct hit like this over a major metropolitan area, we're starting to see the first visuals of the damage that was left behind not only by the wind, but also the storm surge. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten second trivia.  What great desert covers large portions of China and Mongolia? Mojave, Gobi, Arabian or Sahara? Meaning waterless place, the Gobi desert is your answer here. And it's actually not very sandy at all. It's covered mostly by fair rock.  We take you now to the Gobi desert in China. On Thursday, China launch the Shenzhou 17 spacecraft carrying three astronauts. The youngest of which was only 33 years old. They're headed to the Tiangong space station where they're going to live for six months and do some repair work, flying debris, damaged the station solar panels. China's been putting its missions to space in high gear for the past 20 years or so. And now is in a space race rivaling the U.S. and Russia. CNN's Marc Stewart has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  From our spot here at the Jiuquan Space Center in the Gobi desert, we just watched China's latest entry into space, a rocket carrying three astronauts to China's space station. Take a look at the launch. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  3, 2, 1, ignition. STEWART:  It's a mission that comes at a time when there's no cooperation between the American and Chinese Space Programs. Since 2011, the U.S. has effectively banned NASA from working with China and space leading to a 21st Century space race. Chinese officials stress they've never saw hegemony space, but once the international space station is retired, China's Tiangong space station may take on new prominence. China's space program is ambitious, having landed a Rover on Mars and a future goal of a man flight to the moon. Marc Stewart, CNN in the Gobi desert in Northern China. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is all about making wishes come true. This week at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, seven times Super Bowl Champ, Tom Brady, New York Yankee Slugger, Aaron Judge, and Boston Celtic Superstar, Jayson Tatum made wishes come true for a handful of children, battling critical illnesses. Organized by fanatics the global digital sports platform, which announced it has become official sports partner for the nonprofit, Make-A-Wish. The smiles on the faces were proof that the day was a big hit in a world was seemingly lots of bad news lately. This day was a reminder that there's so much good that needs to be shared too. So we wanted to share these moments with you.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  What did this mean to you today to see all these smiling faces out here? JAYSON TATUM, BOSTON CELTICS, NBA:  It meant the world. You know, we get asked a lot of -- to do a lot of things and nothing more rewarding or inspirational at being around kids and kids that, you know, have challenges, but you know, continue to fight and, you know, as much as we inspire and motivate them, they do the same for us. So, you know, when I got asked to do this, you know, I was super excited to be here today. WIRE:  When I look through your social media, I see pictures with you and your hero, Kobe Bryant. And now you're that guy. So what's that mean to you? TATUM:  It's -- it's crazy because, you know, I'm not that far removed from there. Like, you know, I'm 25. So, you know, I still feel like a kid sometimes and, you know, I was excited to see Tom Brady today, right? So I felt like a kid. But, you know, seeing the smiles and how genuine their reactions are, you know, that's the best -- best feeling. WIRE:  I -- I was not excited to see Tom Brady, cause I played six years for the Bills. He called me out. Catching passes, Coy, you never caught one. All right, man. So what message do you have for kids out there who are going through a tough time? How do you persevere and come out on the other side a little bit? TATUM: I think, you know, it's tough, right? It is -- it's very tough. But you have to continue to fight, stay strong, have a good support system. I have good people around you that care about you like these kids and their families. Seeing them here with their friends and brothers and sisters and parents. You know, it's great to see them, have a support system because you need that regardless of how old or young you are.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, lovely people. Hope you had an awesome weekend. I got to carve some pumpkins. I got to meet some of you like Rufus and Conrad at the old Fourth Ward Skate Park here in Atlanta, tearing it up. Fall is in the air. Halloween is tomorrow, and I'm ready to rock this week with you.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we do have to begin with some heavy news, an update for you out of Israel and Gaza. This weekend, Israeli ground forces entered the Gaza Strip in a new phase of fighting in this three- week-old war. The Israel Defense Force or IDF said, they're bringing in infantry, armor and engineer units. Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu said, this is an all-in attempt to destroy Hamas and free over 200 hostages. The hostages were taken during the deadly October 7th attack on Israel by Hamas, the militant fundamentalist Islamic organization operating in West Bank and Gaza.  Israel also ramped up airstrikes over the weekend with many Palestinians saying it was the most intense destruction scene to this point. On Saturday, Prime Minister Netanya warned of a long and difficult war ahead. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  Our heroic fighters have one supreme goal, to destroy this murderous enemy and ensure the existence of our country. We always said, never again. Never again is now. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  While the IDF says Gazans who had moved south would be in a protected space. The World Health Organization said communication lines are down, making any further evacuation suggestions or aid impossible. On Sunday, the Israeli military says more aid trucks will enter Gaza soon. Many around the world, including Pope Francis are calling for a ceasefire. As aid agencies say humanitarian conditions for those caught in the crossfire are desperate and deteriorating. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PHILIPPE LAZZARINI, UNRWA COMMISSIONER GENERAL:  As we speak, people in Gaza are dying. They're not only dying from bombs and strike. Soon, many more will die from the consequences of siege imposed on the Gaza Strip. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  In a statement, IDF said, war planes hit 150 underground targets Friday and said airstrikes and ground forces are aiming their efforts at destroying Hamas basis. One major area of concern is that those bases are extensive throughout civilian areas, often close to, or even under homes. Even hospitals. Here's CNN's Tom Foreman, to explain more on Israel's planned attacks. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The result of all of this, well, we've seen some of the video of that and it's really quite a sight to see in some cases, whole buildings gone and other places hold blocks gone. These Israelis have insisted that what they're doing is trying to target military assets. Although that may include, for example, the home of a Hamas leader, where there may be a lot of people involved. There's a hospital in which, Hamas says, well, that's a hospital. The Israelis say, yeah, it's a Hamas base hiding in a hospital. That sort of thing. Going after the entrances to tunnels. The tunnel network there is a big deal going after command-and- control structures.  If you look at an overall satellite map of the area, you can see that in the Northern part here, this is where most of this has happened. This is where most of the population lives. Every little orange dot there represents one of the strikes that we know of. There's been talk of Israeli troops coming into this area as well.  What it all adds up to is really, as we said, at the beginning, an extraordinary military assault on this area. Yes, Hamas has still tried to fire some missiles out striking Israel. Some of them have struck. That seems to be greatly reduced as this tremendous military pressure comes into this area. And we wait to see what might come next. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  This weekend, it looked like someone took a giant bite out of the moon in what's known as a partial lunar eclipse. People in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Western Australia saw it best. But if you were here in the U.S. on the Eastern coast, you may have spotted it too. A lunar eclipse only happens when we have a full moon. We also call that a Hunter's Moon, which may have gotten its name as it once warned hunters to prepare for a cold winter. Many of you may remember, we learned all about solar eclipses on CNN 10, a few weeks ago. That's when the moon passes between the earth and sun. Well, for a lunar eclipse, they switch positions. Can you guess how? Here's CNN's Rachel Crane to help us out? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RACHEL CRANE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  A lunar eclipse is when the moon passes through the Earth's shadow. This only occurs during a full moon. Two factors decide which of three possible eclipses the moon will experience. The tilt of the moon's orbit around the earth and which of the Earth's two shadows, the moon falls behind. The Earth's darker inner shadow is known as the umbra, and the lighter outer one is called the penumbra.  The penumbra eclipse is when the moon passes through, you guessed it, just the penumbra. NASA says this type of eclipse is so subtle that if you didn't know it was happening, you might not even notice it. A partial eclipse is when the moon only gets covered by part of the Earth's umbra. So only part of it is shaded in darkness by the earth, a partial eclipse happens at least twice a year.  And then there's the big one. The total lunar eclipse. These are rare often separated by years and require the moon earth and sun to be in perfect alignment. But don't think this blacks out the moon, as the moon shifts deeper into the umbra, it takes on a red hue, which is sometimes called a blood moon. The moon turns red because the atmosphere is filtering out color at the opposite end of the visible spectrum, the blue light. The short-wave lengths of blue don't travel as far as the long red wave length. So they scatter before reaching our eyes, leaving behind the red glow.  Not everyone on earth can see a lunar eclipse at the same time. You'll need to be in an area facing the moon during the moments it's shaded by earth, unlike a solar eclipse, you don't need any special equipment to enjoy a lunar eclipse. They're safe to watch at any stage. Although a pair of binoculars might make it more fun. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. During which stage of sleep does most dreaming occur? Stage 1, Stage 2, REM, or ROM? Meaning Rapid Eye Movement, REM sleep is the deep sleep phase where the brain is most active.  Ah, to nap or not to nap? That is the next question. Sometimes we just feel like we need a midday slumber, right? Or maybe a lot of times we feel that way. Of course, there is a time and a place for everything. Don't go falling asleep on your teacher or teachers don't go falling asleep on your students.  Did you know that one-third of adults in the United States take a nap during the day? That's according to the Pew Research Center. Well, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta says a little siesta might be more helpful for our brains than we might think. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VICTORIA GARFIELD, RESEARCH FELLOW, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON:  There's a bunch of experimental American studies. And what they looked at was essentially whether people who napped versus didn't nap, had any cognitive benefits. These studies showed that it looked like people who took a nap did have better cognitive functions. So their thinking skills improved, whether that be things like how quickly you process things, your memory, those sorts of thinking skills. So the biggest takeaway is that we found very clear effect of having a regular daytime nap on the total size of the brain. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The study found that people who had regular naps saw an objective difference in brain size compared to those who didn't. We know that as we age, our brain shrink and that can be associated with cognitive decline. And what she's fundamentally saying is that people who napped regularly in many ways had younger brains than those who didn't.  (On camera):  Is there a right length of a nap? And is it possible to sleep or nap too much? GARFIELD:  One of the issues that that people say often you sleep for too long in the day. As you wake up feeling groggy, you wake up feeling worse and that's because you've gone into deep sleep. Your brain is preparing and mimicking that sleep at night and think you're now ready to sleep for the rest of the day. So in order to avoid that, we've been quite conservative and said, well, maybe something up to about 30 minutes.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Wake up lovely people. It's time for today's story getting a 10 out of 10. Check out this emperor penguin chick, trying to emerge from a shell at SeaWorld San Diego. It has a beak malformation. So curators helped it out. On September 12th, this tuxedo baby became the first emperor penguin to be born at SeaWorld San Diego in a decade.  Now, that's a pengwin. The endangered emperor penguins are native to Antarctica. They can grow to be more than four feet tall and way up to 90 pounds. This young is now growing strong, eating lots of fish, even drinking fish milkshakes. I always thought that penguin ate iceberg crisp or even burritos.  We hope you have an ice day. We don't know what would we do without you. I'm penguin to think that I've taken this punty far enough.  Our first shout out of the week is going to The tigers at Red Oak Junior and Senior High in Red Oak, Iowa. It's your moment, so own it. I'll leave you with this, for those of us out there, feeling a case of the Mondays. Remember what happened the last few days doesn't matter. And what may or may not happen in the days to come doesn't matter, either. Right here, right now, that is where the magic can happen. Rise up. I'm Coy Wire. And we are CNN 10. END231031

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up sunshine. Hope you got more treats than tricks last night. Happy Halloween. This year is flying by it's Wednesday, November 1st. I swear it feels like just yesterday. It was October. It's the start of a glorious galette of holidays. Let's make it a wonderful time of the year. Shall we?  We start today with pop quiz, hot shot.  Ten second trivia.  Caracas is the capital of what South American nation? Venezuela, Peru, Columbia, or Bolivia? Caracas is the capital of Venezuela located in a valley within the Andes mountains.  Venezuela, where we take you now is once one of the wealthiest countries in South America. And did you know that it says on the world's largest oil reserves, but for the past 15 years or so, the economy has been in shambles and that has added to why many Venezuelan have been fleeing. In the U.S. that has contributed to a migrant crisis. In August alone, the Department of Homeland Security said, it encountered more than 55,000 migrants from Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua at the Mexico border. So, what has happened to Venezuela's economy and where does all of this leave everyday Venezuelans? CNN's Stefano Pozzebon explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hundreds of thousands of migrants enter in the U.S. are from Venezuela. But this country's economy collapsed in 2014, almost a decade ago. So what is causing these later spike right now? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Venezuelan among the top nationalities of migrants arriving in the U.S. POZZEBON:  Venezuela was once one of the richest countries in South America, but it never recovers since it enter recession in 2014. When the price of oil and other commodities are plummeted in 2015, Venezuela's revenues dried up almost overnight. And the entire country basically went bankrupt. Inflation was rampant and most of everyday goods were impossible to find. Since then, the socioeconomic crisis has not improved under the government of authoritarian leader Nicolas Maduro. And research shows then more than 80% of the population here, still leave below the poverty line. While they may not have all headed to the U.S. between 2014 and 2020, more than 4 million Venezuelans left the country, according to the United nations. Right now, more than 7.7 millions leave outside of Venezuela. And that is about 25% of the population. To give you an idea, it's like if the entire population of California and Texas left the U.S. in less than a decade. In the last few years, a growing number has started moving north directly towards the U.S. southern border through the Darien Gap, a dense stretch of jungle that connects the South America and Central America.  Social media has also played a significant role because more and more people are documenting their trip and posting it on the likes of Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and TikTok. Informal migrant networks and businesses that help people just at the beginning of the journey have also sped up the pace of migration. More than 400,000 people have already crossed the jungle as of September this year. And the largest group are from Venezuela.  Currently, there are over half a million Venezuelan migrants in the U.S. This month, the White House has starting deporting Venezuela migrants might enter the country illegally, directly back here to Caracas. Political change in Venezuela is not happening anytime soon, with months deposition candidates bar from running for election. And over 270 political prisoners are still behind bars. Countries in the region are saying that they're looking for conservative solutions to handle this historic migration flow. But as long as Venezuela remains in such dire straits, this emergency only since destined to continue. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Now, we continue our coverage of AI, Artificial Intelligence. Developments in the world of AI are happening fast. The hope is that it can spur innovation in health science and technology. The fear is that it might harm national security, replace human workers and upend entire industries.  Monday President Biden unveiled an executive order to address concerns over safety. Executive Orders are signed into law by the president bypassing congressional approval. But they're far less powerful than congressional laws because they can be challenged in court and canceled by future presidents. Let's turn to CNN's Mike Valerio, to learn more about what this order contains.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIKE VALERIO, CNN NEWSOURCE NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  So today matters because this is the first set of federal regulations governing artificial intelligence that have been made. But there are still huge challenges ahead.  (Voice-over):  Artificial intelligence technology is advancing rapidly. And the federal government is scrambling to keep up.  JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT:  I'm about to sign an executive order. The executive order, that is the most significant action any government anywhere in the world has ever taken on AI safety, security and trust. VALERIO:  The White House unveiling, a sweeping new executive order Monday aimed at mitigating the risks of AI while also harnessing its potential. BIDEN:  To realize the promise of AI and avoid the risk, we need to govern this technology. VALERIO:  According to the Biden administration, the order will require all AI developers to share results of their safety tests with the federal government. Before they're released to the public, compel companies to notify the government if an AI model in development poses national security, economic, or health risks, ease immigration barriers for skilled workers to study and stay in the U.S., establish standards to prevent AI production of dangerous biological materials, and develop best practices to minimize the risks of AI displacing human workers. Among a number of other key concerns, Harvard's Bruce Schneier says getting AI regulation right, is critical.  BRUCE SCHNEIER, HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL:  They're not freewheeling technology, they're more like pharmaceuticals. You get them wrong and people die.  VALERIO:  He says, AI has the potential to transform the way we live and work for the better. If the technology is kept in check. SCHNEIER:  This is going in the beginning of a very long and national process, but it's to start, it's an important start.  VALERIO:  Now, just one more important point to stress, this is an executive order. This is not a law governing artificial intelligence. The Congress is hosting ongoing hearings through the rest of the year to talk with experts and figure out the best ways to create legislation, to put up guard rails for artificial intelligence. That's latest here in Los Angeles, I'm Mike Valerio.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10, a coyote trying to absquatulate from an airport. Police on the prowl for a coyote in its howl at an airport in LA on the runway dodging planes. Who would win the race of this wild and frantic chase of a coyote on the loose. Here's CNN's Jeanne Moos. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  At least this coyote is smart enough to look before crossing a runway, turns out it was running away from the airport police at Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles. A chopper from KCAL was stopping by to refuel when it captured the coyote chase.  We couldn't tell if the police were beeping. What we do know there was no roadrunner in sight. We can't tell you much of anything about the coyote that did not introduce itself.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My name is Cayote, Wile E. Coyote.  MOOS:  So our wily reporter can do is play comical chase music, and what the video roll. Coyote sightings here in the San Fernando valley are so common. There's a Facebook page devoted to them with posts like, "Coyotes in my house. Two coyotes, just walking to my house through the garage. Dogs scared them away." It was the police vehicle's mission to scare the airport coyote away. Unlike Wile E. Coyote, airport coyote did not end up flattened. A spokesperson for Van Nuys Airport told CNN we are happy to report that the coyote was able to find its way safely out. Ready for departure subject only to its own, coyote control. Jeanne Moos CNN, New York.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, congrats to @amani2626 from Prairie Trail in Olathe, Kansas.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, beautiful people. Happy Friday eve. It's Thursday, November 2nd. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, where we tell you the what, letting you decide what to think.  I've got some great stories for you today. But first let's talk about the holidays. Halloween is over. People are getting into the spirit -- the spirit of spending the holidays are an important time for retailers. Many of them rely on spending in November and December for as much as 1/5 of their annual sales or more.  And according to a new survey from Deloitte, holiday spending may bounce back big time and even surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Even though shoppers face ongoing inflation, and some are paying off student loans for the first time in years, shoppers are expected to drop an average of about $1,600 for holiday-related purchases. That's 14 percent more than last year. But the survey says many consumers are expecting to receive half as many gifts as they did a few years ago, due to rising costs. The majority of people who responded to the survey also said they do their shopping after Thanksgiving to make the most of Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals.  But let's all remember that we don't need to stress this holiday season. The focus should be on family, friends, and loved ones. We can buy a new watch, but we can't buy time. We can buy a whole house, but we can't buy a home.  This holiday season isn't about the gifts we receive or the money we spend. It's about the moments we make. Now, pop quiz, hot shot, ten-second trivia, which of these names has not been used for a NASA mission. Euclid Galileo, Kepler or Ptolemy? Ptolemy was an Egyptian astronomer, mathematician and geographer born around 100 A.D., but his name has not been used for any NASA missions.  "Lucy, I'm home," a famous line from the 1950 sitcom "I Love Lucy". Lucy is also the name of another NASA mission, but this Lucy is far from home. The mission launched in October of 2021, but yesterday, Lucy reached its first target, an ancient asteroid called Dinkinesh. From a distance of about 265 miles, Lucy gathered images and data about the asteroid, which has only ever appeared as a smudge in telescopes.  Lucy will be NASA's first mission to fly past ancient asteroids around Jupiter left over from the early days of our solar system. It's expected to take 12 years total and cost a lot of money. The launch alone cost about $148 million. Lucy isn't expected to reach its next target until April of 2025. Here's CNN's Kristin Fisher with more details about this historic mission. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNOUNCER: Three, two, one, lift off Atlas V takes flight. KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE & DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The NASA spacecraft is on a 12-year mission covering 6.4 billion kilometers to fly past eight ancient asteroids.  Lucy is the first mission to investigate the Trojan asteroid swarms, which are asteroid clusters along Jupiter's orbital path. Armed with cameras, a thermometer and an infrared imaging spectrometer, Lucy will collect the first high resolution images of these asteroids.  The spacecraft gets her name from the Lucy fossil, an ancient human ancestor whose remains transform the study of hominid evolution. NASA hopes its Lucy transforms the understanding of the evolution of the solar system. After making a few fly-bys of Earth for a gravity slingshot boost, Lucy's expected to reach her first objective in the asteroid belt between Earth and Jupiter. She'll then travel to the Trojan asteroids all named after the heroes of Homer's "Iliad". KEITH NO, PLANETARY ASTRONOMER, NASA GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER: The power of what Lucy is able to do by having so many targets. We can construct all these comparisons between all the different varieties and the diversity that we see in the Trojans, the unexpected diversity -- the different colors, the different collision histories. It's really a repository of fossils, as we like to say, of things that happened at the earliest stages of solar system evolution. FISHER: Is powered by two giant solar arrays. That'll expand outward like Chinese folding fans. They'll carry Lucy farther away from the sun than any other solar powered spacecraft.  Lucy will never return to Earth, but she won't be the last to visit the asteroids. NASA plans to send more. China and Russia are teaming up on an asteroid mission in 2024, and the UAE in 2028.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up sunshine. It's time to shine. Welcome to CNN 10. It's Friday, rise up. I'm your host Coy Wire. Let's get dominating this day with the best 10 minutes in news. We've got everything covered this week, right, from workers strikes to Royal visits in Kenya to AI. But we start today with news regarding the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. Looking further into how the world is responding this time on some college campuses in the U.S. where tensions are running high.  Some students have been holding rallies, vigils, and protests to voice their feelings about this war. Some are pro-Israeli, the nation where at least 1400 people were killed when Hamas attacked on October 7th, others are pro-Palestinian in the ongoing counter attacks by Israel, nearly 10,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, the area where Hamas is based. Many students, regardless of their stance are attempting to condemn violence overall, while largely peaceful, some student groups have erupted into fighting at colleges, including North Carolina Chapel Hill, Indiana University, and Tulane University. Because of competing protests at Columbia University administrators, temporary closed campus on Thursday. Universities have been the centerpiece of demonstrations throughout the years. Notably as students fought for civil rights in 1960s and protested U.S. involvement in the Vietnam war in the 1970s. The first amendment gives students and everyone the right to express themselves stating that no laws can restrict "freedom of speech" or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble." Throughout the years, though, the Supreme Court has stated that that protection has limits and does not include inciting violence. On Tuesday at Cornell University, a student was arrested for allegedly threatening to harm Jewish students in an online post. And the student has been charged in federal court.  Well, Cornell closed on Friday telling CNN this was meant to ease the stress that's been felt in the past weeks. Some Jewish students have told CNN that they're seeing an increase in anti-Jewish action and hatred, which is referred to as antisemitic. Antisemitism has long been a problem on college campuses. And in a survey done in March over half of Jewish students responded saying they'd witnessed or experienced an antisemitic incident.  At the same time, however, advocacy groups like the Council on American Islamic Relations and the Anti-Defamation league say Muslim people throughout the country have also been the target of increasing harassment and attacks. The type of which are referred to as Islamophobic. President Biden, who has voiced his administration's support of Israel has now stated that his administration will also work on a first ever strategy to combat anti-Muslim sentiment.  College administrators are tasked with attempting to ease tensions on campuses while also expressing support for their student bodies, and their rights. Many colleges have released statements about the war in the middle east, but some of those responses have incited further protest. Some universities are choosing to refrain from weighing in at all that has come with some criticism as well. We'll continue to keep you updated on this issue right here on CNN 10.  It's about that time for Daylight Saving Time. This first Sunday in November, we will fall back or turn our clocks back an hour, or our smartphones will do it for us. So do we gain an hour of sleep or lose an hour? Well, if you usually get up at 6:00 a.m., you're now going to be getting up at what would've been 7:00 a.m. So yes, we will gain an hour of sleep, hallelujah. On the first Sunday in March. We spring forward or set our clocks forward an hour.  Daylight Saving Time has been used for more than a century. It was enacted to help us make more use of the day's light. But a Monmouth University poll found most Americans wants to stop recognizing it altogether. Some doctors even say the clock change isn't healthy and can cause headaches in some of us by affecting the hypothalamus in the brain. The part that manages our circadian rhythm, the circadian rhythm helps all living things adapt and respond to light and dark within a 24-hour span.  Ten second trivia.  If you're visiting a loch in Scotland, what are you visiting? A castle, a bridge, a lake or a school?  Ding, ding, ding, ding answer is, a loch. That's a lake or large body of water surrounded by land. For today's story getting a 10 out of 10, we're headed to Scotland to check up on a tale of a monster named Nessie in a Loch named Ness. Here CNN's Max Burnell with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MAX BURNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Scotland's Loch Ness has long been shrouded in mystery with reports of monsters lurking in its inky depth stating back to ancient times, it came to the world's attention in the 1930s with a string of reported sightings and an iconic photo. And while it has turned out to be one of many hoaxes, monster hunters and curious, tourists alike have continued to flock here ever since. Now after more than 90 years of fascination, they can visit a new 1.9 million center dedicated to all things Loch Ness monster. While those wanting to take a closer look can take a trip on the deep scan research vessel. Its skipper Alistair Matheson has spent the last 10 years giving visitors and researchers their best chance of spotting Nessie. ALISTAIR MATHESON, DEEPSCAN CAPTAIN LOCH NESS PROJECT:  We have been working in recent years out here. We've done a few big projects. One of those projects involved mapping the bottom of Lock Ness. Now, we were using some very clever equipment. And using that equipment I can confirm to you all we did. In fact, find the Lock Ness monster.  This is the very monster we found here. Well, not quite, not quite, I'm afraid because, because it turned out it was this. So it was actually built for a movie. But back in the real world, we're going to sail out into the middle of the loch. You will get to see the size of Loch Ness. It's fairly big, of course. Loch Ness is 23 miles long, but on average it's only a mile wide and it's deep as well.  So right now we are 226 meters deep and 227 is maximum depth, big red dot. That's going to be our monster. In 10 years that I've been doing this three times on the echo center in the big red dot. That would be my closest encounter with a monster. BURNELL:  Between 2018 and 2019, the Deepscan helped conduct a DNA survey of the loch while the large amounts of eel DNA found pointed to a more terrestrial explanation. It didn't deter monster hunter, Alan McKenna from organizing the biggest creature hunt for 50 years back in August. But the lack of concrete evidence over the years has done little to dampen the mystery for many. MATHESON:  Definitive proof is always what we want. Isn't it -- we always want to know yes or no and everything about life, not just monsters, but for me, there's a mystery here. And that's what I firmly believe in. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, it has been so nice learning with you this week and laughing and having some fun. Halloween was epic. My family were witches, black cats, and I was the magic broomstick carrying the tiny witches on the candy hunts.  And how about these costumes? Paul from Mr. Neypossi's (ph) class in Boston's Spa, New York, looking mighty fierce, I have to say. And dad, Mr. Rispo (ph) rocking the room and rains look. Or how about the firewalls? Ms. Seamers (ph) and Mrs. Statomyer (ph) at Tumwater in Washington. Now that's a 10 out of 10. Thanks to all of you. We have officially reached 800,000 subscribers on our YouTube channel. So now I can do two shoutouts at the end of every YouTube version of the show.  Today's shoutout go to Bellmont High School Decatur, Indiana. We see you. And Chaney Middle School in West Fargo, North Dakota, rise up. Have a great weekend everyone. And remember you are more powerful than you know. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. It's been a blessing to spend this week with you. END231106

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, sunshine. Hope you had a wonderful weekend. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. Let's get our minds right this motivation Monday. New week's bring new opportunities, but we only have seven Mondays left this year. Can you believe? So, let's make the most of them. We've got the best 10 minutes in news for you. And we start with the latest news regarding space. We're getting a rare look inside of one of China's space centers. For two decades, just the United States and the Soviet Union we're in competition to see who could be the first to conquer space. The whole world watch as the Apollo 11 landed and human beings walked on the moon for the first time.  But now more than 50 years later, a new competition for space exploration has emerged with more countries involved as well, including China and India. China is now in a race with the U.S. to set a permanent outpost and research station on the moon. The Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert is one of the places that China is pursuing its future in space. And CNN's Marc Stewart takes us there to get an inside, look and check out the launch of a Chinese spacecraft. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): China has big ambitions in space. It operates a space station, has sent rovers to the far side of the Moon and Mars, and is now aiming to put humans on the lunar surface. Those voyages begin in the middle of the Gobi Desert in Northern China. After two flights in about four hours on the bus, we arrive at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. Access to the Space Center here is rare, and it is sprawling. There are so many buildings, so many streets. It's very reminiscent of a small city or town. We're here to witness the launch of the Shenzhou-17 spacecraft. From behind glass, we met its crew of three that are headed to China's space station. Since 2011, the U.S. government has effectively banned NASA from working with China in space, contributing to a 21st Century space race with two super powers, both aiming for the moon and beyond. Through its Artemis program, NASA is aiming to set up a permanent lunar outpost later this decade and China is aiming to set up a lunar research station on a similar timeframe.  (On camera): Are there any benefits from this competitive environment? ZHANG WANXIN, SENIOR OFFICIAL, CHINA ASTRONAUT RESEARCH AND TRAINING CENTER (through translator):  I think a competitive environment can help us all improve. Exploring space is the common goal for all mankind. So I think if we can work together, it will improve space exploration. STEWART:  Chinese officials, stress they've never sought dominance in space. Yet once the international space station is retired by 2031 China's Tiangong space station may take on new prominence.  (On camera):  If China, for a period of time is the only nation with a space station, how does China benefit? LEROY CHIAO, FORMER ISS COMMANDER, NASA:  If they're the only game in town, that's the only way that these countries can participate in human space flight. STEWART:  Russia, as well as some commercial space companies have space station proposals in the works, but success for any of them is far from guaranteed.  China's space program is a huge source of national pride. We talked to China's first astronaut. YANG LIWEI, CHINA'S FIRST ASTRONAUT IN SPACE (through translator):  Looking at this launch as a veteran, the first thing I see is how far China's man's space flight has come. Over the past 20 years, it has developed rapidly and made great achievements in them. I see the strength of our reserve force. And the hope for the future development of China's aerospace industry. (On camera):  We are just minutes away from liftoff. You can see the rocket back there. This is part of this bigger mission to maintain and expand China's space station.  (Voice-over):  With each mission, China can learn more and continue to challenge what has been a long stretch of U.S. dominant in space. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  This winter, parts of the United States will be seeing lots of snow stack of. Thanks to a strong El Nino, the weather pattern in tropical Pacific that typically brings weather and cooler weather scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA have created maps to help people prepare. The maps show snowfall during all El Nino winters and during moderate to strong El Nino winters. And this one, that shows the number of years with below average snowfall during the 13 moderate to strong El Nino winters.  These maps though give a sense of what we might expect. They're more like historical guides, not crystal ball forecast for the upcoming snow season. This El Nino though is predicted to be the most powerful. The contiguous United States has seen in eight years when it caused the warmest winter on record, while every El Nino winter is unique, it usually brings wetter and cooler conditions to the Southern U.S., and dryer warmer weather up north. And that's exactly what's on the horizon for this winter. Ten second trivia. Which of these college degrees is considered the highest level of academic degree? Master's, Associate, Doctoral, or bachelor's? Just with the doctor order, the doctoral degree is the most advanced diploma symbolizing a person has mastered a specific area of study. This year, we've talked about the growing influence potential and emerging concerns of the impact of artificial intelligence across many industries. But what about education? It's a question many college campuses are dealing with AI chatbots, programs that generate text. They've raised new questions for many educators who are focused on students, not only getting the right answer, but also understanding the course material.  A survey of college students earlier this year showed more than 51% believe using AI tools to complete assignments and exams is cheating. While plagiarism and cheating are not a new phenomenon in academia, these new tools have created a more complex environment and administrations are struggling to set new ground rules. Should these tools be banned or is there a way that they could be used responsibly?  The landscape is changing. There have been numerous cases of students being caught and punished for using AI. And there are also cases of students saying they've been falsely accused of using the technology inappropriately. The response by professors has been varied with some ignoring the new technology, some banning it and others are changing the way they format their exams. Some are switching back to written papers after many years of digital only. But how easy is it to spot AI content? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DARREN HICK, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY, FURMAN UNIVERSITY:  Why are you doing this? STEVEN KELTS, LECTURER, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY:  We're still going to know. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  These college professors say, students are increasingly cutting and pasting AI generated text in their essays, and that is cheating. These professors say they're not falling for it. And there are often three extremely obvious giveaways. Number one, the essay is suspiciously perfect. HICK:  A ChatGPT generated essay looks like it was written by a very competent 12th grader. CHRISTOPHER BARTEL, PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY, APPALACHIAN STATE UNIVERSITY:  AI generated text has no mistakes. It's like robotically, bland text. Nobody would actually speak that way. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Another giveaway, the essay has no human voice. KELTS:  The built-in voice of a model like ChatGPT is the voice of a 50- year-old compliance lawyer. SARAH ELAINE EATON, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF EDUCATION, UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY:  It seems to lack vibrancy. There's not a lot of authentic student voice or experience in there. BARTEL:  An AI generated text feels like an essay that's written by an intelligent person who has never had a class with me. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And third, AI essays often cite false research.  HICK:  Perhaps the biggest thing that a ChatGPT generated essay can do is shake the instructor's own confidence in what they know about the source material. BARTEL:  It will just make things up. It will attribute ideas to people that could never have had those ideas.  ANTONY AUMANN, PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY, NORTHERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY:  It'll combine perfect grammar with something that's like, obviously false. PENELOPE ADAMS MOON, CENTER FOR TEACHING AND LEARNING DIRECTOR, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON:  It can't distinguish between fact and fiction. It can't distinguish between information and disinformation. HICK:  It will look like it's quoting and it will look like it's citing. But if those sources don't look familiar to you, there's a good chance. This is written by AI. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, you ever wonder, what's behind your feline friends, furry faces? Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is all about expressions of cattitude. Scientists observe 53 cats interacting at a cat cafe in California. Over a 10-month span, the study found that domesticated cats have 276 different facial expressions. They determine that about 45% of those expressions were friendly, good kitty, while 37% were aggressive.  The study demonstrates the cat communication is more complex than previously assumed. And apparently cats are a meowtain of emotions and their feelings are kitten all over their faces.  Look how cats because we have some bulldogs to shoutout.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And it's your CNN 10. We're putting your vocabulary word in tomorrow's show for #YourWordWednesday. Follow me @coywire on Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok. Put your word, definition, your school and teacher's name in the comment section of my most recent post. And we're going to choose one winner to work into tomorrow's show. Today, though, it is Tuesday, November 7th, and it's not just any Tuesday. It's the Tuesday after the first Monday of November, A-K-A election Day here in the United States. Federal elections have historically happened on this day to accommodate farmers across the country. Did you know? It's after the harvest, but before the weather gets too cold.  Why Tuesday? Well, people didn't want to travel to the polls on Sundays because of church. And Wednesday was a day that a lot of farmers would take their goods to the market to sell. That left Tuesday as one of the most convenient days to hold U.S. elections, something we still observe to this day. Those who are heading to the polls today, they won't be voting for president, that's next year. But some cities will be voting for mayor, in some states will be voting for governor, and other legislative and constitutional issues are on the table. The outcome of those elections could give a better idea of how Americans are feeling about certain issues ahead of the U.S. presidential election next year. And you can follow along right here with us on CNN. Moving on now to another choice, multiple choice. Pop quiz, hot shot.  Ten second trivia. One of the world's most iconic structures. The Taj Mahal is located in which city in India? New Delhi, Mumbai, Agra, or Kolkata? Beginning construction in 1632, the Taj Mahal is located in this city of Agra.  The Taj Mahal is considered one of the most beautiful sites in the world. In fact, it was named one of the new seven wonders of the world. But it could become more difficult to see and to glimpse this glorious site because of pollution. It's an unhealthy, even hazardous problem for parts of India. Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai were among the 10 most polluted cities on earth this week, according to a Swiss company called IQAir. CNN's Michael Holmes explains what it all means. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR:  India's iconic monument, almost lost in the smog in the city of Agra. It's not the psych tourists nor the businesses, which depend on them, want to see. NIRANJAN SINGH, PHOTOGRAPHER (through translator):  We are facing difficulty in taking pictures of Taj Mahal due to pollution. The Taj Mahal is not clearly visible. Tourists are also facing issues. HOLMES: Every year, when the temperatures drop and farmers burn their fields, the air turns toxic in many Indian cities. Delhi is notoriously ranked among the world's most polluted cities and the current air quality there has once again, reached hazardous conditions, forcing primary schools to temporarily close and many people to work from home or just stay indoors altogether.  The problem is so serious. A recent air quality life index report says poor air quality could shorten an average Indian's life expectancy by more than five years. If World Health Organization guidelines on curbing pollution aren't met. And it's even affecting one of the country's favorite pastimes. India is currently hosting the quicker World Cup with Bangladesh set to play Sri Lanka in a match in Delhi. But the air quality is so poor. Some players are wearing masks and both teams have canceled training sessions. The coach of Bangladesh's team says the conditions have not been ideal. CHANDIKA HATHURUSINGHE, BANGLADESH CRICKET TEAM COARCH:  Our doctors keep a close eye on players. Even for practice, we're very conscious. We train what we have to train, and they go back into the dressing room. HOLMES: Unfortunately, for cricket fans and Delhi residents alike, officials say pollution levels are expected to be high for the next two to three weeks. Michael Holmes, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Hey, Siri? SIRI:  Uh-huh? WIRE:  Call earth. SIRI:  I don't see Earth in your contacts, to who? WIRE:  I'm trying to make a call to earth. SIRI:  I don't see earth in your contacts, to who? WIRE:  Never mind. It's time for CNN's call to earth. And we're going to go diving into our next story with a team of researchers exploring underwater sites so deep. It takes some three hours to resurface. They're hoping their studies can help us better understand and preserve our oceans. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GHISLAIN BARDOUT, CO-FOUNDER & CO-DIRECTOR, UNDER THE POLE:  When you are a diver, you are always curious to go to see a little bit further. I think every single diver in the world, when you are about to go up, you always have an eye to the depth, to the bottom. Little by little, you want to go deeper because you wonder what -- what are you going to find? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ghislain Bardout with his wife Emmanuelle in 2007, he has conducted thousands of dives often to 150 or even 200 meters deep. His crew has explored everywhere from the Arctic to the Canary Islands, French Polynesia to the Caribbean. BARDOUT:  We are talking about new ecosystem that's covered the entire planet. All the shore, everywhere. It's just below 30 meters, 40 meters. And there are, for sure, many species, many different ecosystem that all have a huge importance. So acquiring a better understanding of their, their ecology is essential for the conservation of those depths. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  With scientists aboard their boat under the poll aims to document these ecosystems for the first time and help preserve their future. BARDOUT:  The length of the missions are from months to years. It's very demanding, very tiring. It's a very big engagements, not only human engagement. It's a huge logistical organizational engagement. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ghislain's team are preparing for a six-month expedition, in the Mediterranean next year. That will take them from Greece to Italy, to France. EMMANUELLE PERIE-BARDOUT, CO-FOUNDER & CO-DIRECTOR, UNDER THE POLE:  If we spend 20 minutes at 130 meters, we will -- we will take three hours to come back to the surface. And this is not negotiable. You have to take this three hours, whatever happens. You need to be technically ready and psychologically ready also to make this type of dive. And, yeah, it takes years to be ready for that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In 2022, under the Pole help gain protection for black coral force in the Canary Islands. And they believe there is a similar ecosystem to be explored on their Mediterranean voyage next year.  BARDOUT:  In Greece, they already explored the depths with robots ROVs. So they know some fields of black corals, but are not able to study because of the depths, because they do not have the diverse to do so. And I like those missions where there's huge collaborations, you know, with different people that can do together something they cannot do alone or just with their own team. PERIE-BARDOUT:  Our mission is really to make the invisible visible, even if it's deep, even if it's very far away like in the polar regions, we need this place and we need to protect it. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 looks like a really gourd time. What should you do with all those leftover pumpkins? Whatever you do, throw them away before they get all moldy or gooey, or you could do with this middle school teacher in North Dakota did blowing up the pumpkins in the name of science. Do not try this at home.  He's using the pumpkins to demonstrate a chemical reaction between water and a compound called calcium carbide. And this chemical reaction got a great reaction from the students.  Did you know, Jack O'Lanterns originated in Irelands to ward off evil spirits. But instead of using pumpkins, the Irish carved creepy phases into turnips. It's time to turn up right here on CNN 10.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, sunshine. We're halfway through the week, but we're going to keep on grinding and shining because that's just what we do. It's Wednesday, November 8th and the holiday travel season is almost upon us. So in the spirit of that pack your best, because we're going to be going around the world for several stories today. But first let's talk specifically about what's happening at some of the airports heading into the holidays.  If you're traveling through international airports in Boston, San Francisco, Washington, or New York, you may see extra security for the tiniest of passengers, bacteria and viruses. The U.S. centers for disease control and prevention or CDC is expanding a program that detects COVID-19 to include more than 30 pathogens, it's called the Traveler-Based Genomic Surveillance Program. It was first introduced in 2021 during the pandemic, even though the U.S. has relaxed a lot of its pandemic-related restrictions, thousands of people are still being hospitalized with the disease.  As part of the surveillance program, international travelers can volunteer for nasal swabs. The CDC has also been testing airplane wastewater since 2022. Did you know? Today they've tested more than 370,000 people arriving from more than 135 countries at seven participating U.S. airports.  Now, four of those airports will also test for bacteria and viruses behind infectious diseases like the flu and RSV. This surveillance program is meant to help health officials detect new variants of COVID-19 and other diseases before they spread across the country.  Now, pop quiz, hot shot. Ten second trivia. In Egyptian mythology, what creature has the head of a human in the body of a lion?  Griffin, Sphinx, Phoenix or Centaur? If you think sphinx, you think correctly, the sphinx is an important figure in Egyptian and Greek art. A giant carving of the mythical creature, the sphinx lies in the sand near Giza famous pyramids in Egypt. The great sphinx is thousands of years old. It stands 66 feet tall and it's thought to be carved from a single piece of limestone. But how would such a huge sculpture end up in the desert? Well, one popular theory was put forward by geologists, Farouk El-Baz. He believed that the desert wind, shaped a natural land form to resemble a reclining sphinx. And the ancient Egyptians simply added surface details.  El-Baz came up with his theory about 40 years ago and a new study suggests he may have been onto something. A team of scientists at NYU's applied mathematics lab replicated windy conditions, the Great Sphinx likely faced 4,500 years ago instead of wind, they used a flat stream of water. And when it was washed over clay models of natural land forms, low and behold, a lion shape took form.  All right, from the sands of Giza, we'll dive now into another big discovery spotted in the waters of Hawaii. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is a rarely seen, whale shark, according to researchers from the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology Shark Research Lab, who captured the footage near the Hawaiian islands. The whale shark is the world's largest species of fish and is known to live in Hawaiian water, as the research say.  MARK ROYER, UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII, SHARK MANAGER:  They're here more often than we think, but however, they are probably hard to come across. I didn't see this animal until they hopped in the water. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Royer observed the 30-foot shark beating on Hawaiian entities known as nehu and approaching their boat that was starting idle in the water. Experts say that in these situations it's important to be mindful, let the shark approach, but don't aggressively get close and disturb it. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  That was whaly cool. One other fun fact about whale sharks, the largest fish on the planet, even though they're about as big as a school bus with enormous mouths, they couldn't eat you even if they wanted to. Their throat is only the size of a quarter, designed only to swallow small, tiny little fish.  All right, our next story takes us to the Hawaiian Highlands where we're getting a glimpse of an extremely rare bird. The kind of which only five are thought to be remaining in the wild. Researchers though, they're working to help them make a comeback. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  High up on a plateau in the middle of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, a team of researchers carefully transport, some extremely precious cargo. (OFF MIC) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They've spent three days in this remote and rain- soaked expanse of jungle, looking for something very specific and very small. The egg of one of the world's most critically endangered species, a Hawaiian honeycreeper known as the 'Akikiki, found nowhere else on earth but here. According to the Hawaiian Department of Land and Natural Resources, there are only five of the species left in the wild. HANNAH BAILEY, WILDLIFE CARE MANAGER, KEAUHOU BIRD CONSERVATION CENTER, SAN DIEGO ZOO WILDLIFE ALLIANCE:  The current state of 'Akikiki is pretty bad right now. We do have about 50 'Akikiki in human care at our two centers in Hawaii. And we do know that this past breeding season, there were no surviving chicks in the wild. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Hannah Bailey manages the Keauhou Bird Conservation Center on the island of Hawaii. The center serves as a Noah's Ark of sorts for the 'Akikiki. BAILEY:  Our mission is to provide safe haven populations of the species that are in peril so that when the environment is right for them to survive long-term, we'll be able to re-release them. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Hannah says the current state of all of Hawaii's forest birds is dire due in part to the usual culprits like habitat loss, but a newer and more deadly manners has emerged. BAILEY:  The biggest threat right now to Hawaii's endangered birds is mosquitoes. Because they carry avian malaria, which the birds have no resistance to. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  According to the American Bird Conservancy, climate change has enabled non-native mosquitoes to find their way to Kauai's highest elevations. The 'Akikiki's last refuge in the wild. BAILEY:  This is a portable brooder box that we can also use to incubate eggs. And it helps us transfer eggs from one location to another that have been incubated safely so that they will continue to grow and develop. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We need to have landscape level solutions to the mosquito problems. In the meantime, keeping the birds in centers like this one where enclosures are designed to mimic their natural habitat, but to protect it from mosquitoes, and where human interaction is strictly limited to discourage imprinting, a process where animals lose their natural behavior. These may very well be an entire species last chance at survival. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, from mythical beasts in ancient Egypt to rare creatures in modern day, Hawaii, we've been all around the world today. Time for our grand finale, today's story getting a 10 out of 10 takes us to the sleepy mountain town of Hope in British Columbia, Canada. That wasn't quite such a sleepy town after a collision involving a trailer full of fireworks it led to a light show that was anything but infinitesimal. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  You expect to see fireworks on a national holiday, but not just driving down a dark highway. RYAN KUHN, RECORDED FIREWORKS:  Probably the most spectacular firework show we'll ever see in our lives. It was quite a -- a site to behold. MOOS:  Ryan Kuhn was driving with his wife on the trans-Canada highway, near town called Hope in British Columbia, police say a tractor trailer rear ended a pickup parked at the side of the road with a trailer full of fireworks in tow. Traffic was stopped.  (On camera): And how long did the show last? KUHN: It was about an hour. The first half an hour was nonstop fireworks. So imagine the crescendo of the best firework show you've ever seen. It was just nonstop for 30 minutes. MOOS:  Some dared to get out of their cars, still wary of flying debris. The driver of the pickup hit by the truck had minor injuries, wrote one commenter, "Dude! That's better than Disney's fireworks. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Now, that's the way to end this show with a bang. Congrats to Mr. Rhodes and the Mustangs in Sumner, Nebraska, you submitted the winner for #YourWordWednesday, infinitesimal, an adjective, meaning extremely small. Well done.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: What's up superstars. It's about that time. It's Thursday, November 9. And it's time to shine. Hey, that kind of rhyme. And I wasn't even trying, I'm lying. I was. Happy Friday eve. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start today with some pandemonium. These giant pandas at the national zoo in Washington are very important pandas. The pandas are native to China with an estimated 1800 left in the wild.  That's according to the World Wildlife Fund. They're also China's national animal. Giant pandas live off of bamboo and they can eat more than 80 pounds of the plant every day. And they're not called giant pandas for nothing. A male can weigh up to 300 pounds. That's an offensive lineman in the NFL. So what makes these three bears so special? Well, China loaned them to the National Zoo as part of a program that dates back more than 50 years.  But next week, this family, mom, and dad and their cub will return home. And it's unclear whether China will send new bears. CNN Correspondent, David Culver explains why this is significant in the big picture of what's come to be known as Panda diplomacy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: For weeks, visitors at the National Zoo in Washington have stopped by to say goodbye. The zoo's three giant pandas now headed to China. Zoo staff, call this a hiatus in their five decade wildly popular panda program. Chinese officials have yet to say, if it will continue. You might wonder, why this even matters?  There are, of course, far more pressing issues between the U.S. and China. But as we look deeper, tracking where Pandas are leaving and where they're going, you get a better sense of the new world order. China's hoping to craft these cuddly creatures used for China's major political and diplomatic needs, especially in places where it hopes to gain. But China says its focus is on conservation and research. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: President Nixon's visit to our country --  CULVER: Beijing's Panda diplomacy with Washington as it's called kicked off in 1972. Following President Nixon's historic visit to China, Chairman Mao Zedong, the Founder of Communist, China gifted two Panas to the U.S. in a sign of warming, bilateral ties after decades of diplomatic deep freeze. First Lady, Pat Nixon welcome the Pandas to Washington. PAT NIXON, FORMER FIRST LADY: They will be enjoyed by the millions of people who come from across the country. CULVER: Seen their popularity rise amongst Americans, China sent more pandas to other zoos across the U.S., eventually loaning instead of gifting them. The 2011 agreement between China and the National Zoo stipulates ownership of the Pandas and any offspring belonged to China. The contract also requires payment to China of $500,000 each year for the conservation of giant Pandas in China.  At its height, there were 15 pandas in the United States, but in the last decade, the numbers have dropped coinciding with worsening U.S.-China relations with the three Pandas now departing the national zoo that only leaves zoo Atlanta with Pandas in the U.S.  For now, the contracts for Atlanta's final four expire next year, no word on any extension. (On camera): And that could mean that by the end of 2024, the only Panda in zoos in all of the Americas would be Xin Xin right here in Mexico City. (Voice-over): China's also loaned out new giant pandas to other countries, including E.U. nations, like Denmark, Finland, and Germany, and in the Middle East, Qatar getting their first Panda last year. Regions where China is looking to bolster its relations and increase its influence. Staff at the National Zoo, hopeful China might one day send over more giant Pandas. They're even planning renovations for the soon to be vacant Panda exhibit. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Ten second trivia. Who gave the aurora borealis its name? Galileo, Cassini, Copernicus, or Kepler? Galileo, Galileo was the astronomer who came up with the name in the early 1600s. Aurora borealis also known as Northern lights. It's an atmospheric phenomenon that creates enchanting dancing waves of light associated with countries surrounding the Arctic like Canada, Russia, and Norway.  But last weekend, you didn't have to head for the North Pole to catch these mesmerizing shining skies. The borealis were spotted in parts of the U.K., Ukraine, and Slovakia. And according to experts, southern sightings could become more common with increased solar activity. So how does the sun summon this nighttime spectacle? We've got your answer right here. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JENNIFER GRAY, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Described as one of Earth's greatest light shows, and aurora is one of the most fascinating and beautiful naturally occurring phenomena. You might know it as in Northern lights, but it's technically called the Aurora Borealis in the Northern hemisphere, in the Aurora Australia's or Southern lights in the Southern hemisphere. This phenomenon occurs above the magnetic poles in the Northern and Southern hemisphere. They form when gas is particles in the Earth's atmosphere, collide with charged particles released from the sun, electrons and protons from the sun are blown toward the earth by the solar wind.  As these are carried towards earth, most of them are deflected by Earth's magnetic field. However, the magnetic field is weaker at the poles, allowing some of the particles to funnel into the Earth's atmosphere. The vibrant colors produced are determined by the type of gases that are colliding. The result is a brilliant display of the common green in yellow, less common blue and violet, even rare reds painting the night sky and ribbons arcs or shooting rays. Oxygen produces green in red light while nitrogen gives off blue and purple. The best time of year to view the light show is during the winter months, when the nights are longer. Under a cloud free sky away from light pollution. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is a wild crash landing that helped one buyer knock a couple bucks off a deal. CNN's Jeanne Moos has all the deer tales. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT: 13-year-old, Troy Wescott, was outside his maze landing, New Jersey home shooting hoops with his dog Parker when he heard rustling in the leaves, the dogs spotted the deer first.  But just as spectacular as the leap was this coincidence, the 2007 Chevy Silverado pickup was for sale. And at the exact same moment, the prospective buyer pulled up to cinch the deal, the deer slammed into the pickup.  (On camera): What did he say?  TROY WESCOTT, WITNESSED DEER LEAP: He was just shocked. He was like, oh wow. MOOS: Troy's dad was likewise stunned, but the buyer wasted no time in asking. JILLIAN VAUGHN, TROY'S MOM: How about a little break on the price for the damage to the truck? MOOS: The dent left by the young box saved the buyer, 1000 bucks off the asking price. The sellers started cracking jokes. VAUGHN: We think that the deer was trained. I said, man, I know y'all brought that deer with you. MOOS: As the video went viral, commenters had two questions.  VAUGHN: People are asking, is the deer okay? MOOS: He seems to be OK, spotted on a neighbor's trail camera. VAUGHN: People are asking if the truck is still for sale. MOOS: Nope, sold, but it took a flying deer to make a pickup less deer by a thousand bucks. Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Oh dear, that was staggering. It would've behooved them to keep that truck in the garage. Hey, you Santa, you see that fly in deer, pick them up.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  It's the next day of the week, and it's the best day of the week, Friyay. It's Friday, November 10. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And before we have some fun, we start today with our ongoing coverage of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. We're giving you not one, but two quick one-minute reports that dive into different aspects of this story.  First up, Hamas tunnels. Israel Defense forces are continuing their bombardment and invasion of Gaza, saying one of their intentions is to destroy the infrastructure that allows Hamas, the militant fundamentalist Islamic Organization, to launch its attacks. That infrastructure is largely made up of what Israel says are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels that Hamas has spent years building underneath the city streets in Gaza.  Israel calls it the Gaza Metro. In 2018, CNN got a rare glimpse inside these tunnels in the footage you're seeing now. For more on this vast underground network, we turn to our Oren Liebermann/ (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  The Israeli military controls the air and says they've encircled Gaza city on the ground. But underneath the surface, Hamas still has the advantage. Israel is going after Hamas's underground infrastructure. This soldier shows an electrical system he says is used to circulate air underground.  The IDF says it has destroyed 130 tunnel shafts since the start of the war. That's just a small fraction of what's known as Gaza's Metro. Israel says there are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels below Gaza. In 2018, CNN was given an exclusive look at a Palestinian Islamic Jihad tunnel inside Gaza. Its concrete walls creating a durable underground maze that favors the defender. Tunnels can pose problems for even advanced militaries. But Israel faces an even greater challenge. Hamas is believed to be holding many of the approximately 240 hostages underground, possibly in different groups.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Now for our next quick minute, as Israel moves further into Gaza, residents are fleeing south. As they walk, they wave white flags, a symbol that for centuries signals that the flag bearer is not fighting. The Hamas controlled Health Ministry said this week that more than 10,000 people have been killed in Gaza, with that number largely made up of vulnerable populations, including more than 4000 children, 2600 women and 600 elderly. These numbers cannot be independently verified, though, by CNN.  With more on the residents of Gaza, we turn now to our Salma Abdelaziz.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  Taking only what they can carry, families are fleeing Gaza City. They wave white flags made of anything they can find. And as the sounds of war echo around them, they signal yet again that they are innocents. The Israeli military has been calling for weeks on all those living in the northern part of the strip to southwards. Most recently opening what it called safe corridors for limited windows of time. Pushing thousands here to Salah al-Din Street, where evacuees describe a harrowing journey. The only way to reach the route is by foot or by cart for those who can find room. There was heavy shelling on our neighborhood and we were forced to flee. We have to use these donkey carts because there's no fuel, he says. They cut everything off to force us out of our homes. The U.N. calls this exodus forcible displacement and accuses Israel of the collective punishment of some 2 million people.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Let's turn now to space, where Japanese scientists are thinking about our rising space waste problem. Researchers at Kyoto University in Japan are building wooden satellites, hoping to soon send them into space. Why wood, not the usual metal? Well, when satellites are no longer in use, they come back into Earth's atmosphere, where they break up into metallic particles, that litters the layer of the Earth we call the stratosphere. That's the second atmospheric layer of Earth that rises anywhere from 6 to 12 miles above the Earth's surface, depending on where you are on the equator.  And we're getting a lot of space debris. In 2021, we sent up nearly 1400 satellites into space, with scientists worried that this future satellite trash, if you will, could damage the ozone. The Kyoto University researchers say wooden satellites can hold up to metal ones because there's no oxygen in space that can break down the wood. But when the satellite has run its course and it starts rapidly descending back towards Earth, poof, they just turn into gas. They've tested three types of wood so far, with the Japanese bigleaf magnolia coming up as the winner so far, if all goes well, we might just see a prototype in space next year.  Ten second trivia.  Which basketball star holds the all-time 3-point contest record for points scored in a single round?  Steph Curry, Sabrina Ionescu, Diana Taurasi, or Larry Bird, cuckoo. In July lie of this year, WNBA Star Sabrina Ionescu broke Steph Curry's record by hitting 25 of 27 three pointers.  For today's story, getting a 10 out of 10. We're getting secrets of success from one of the hardest working, most focused people you could ever meet. WNBA superstar Sabrina Ionescu plays for the New York Liberty, and she's set to represent Team USA at the Olympics in 259 days. I caught up with her at practice this week to ask some questions just for you.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  What's up, lovely people? I'm here at practice for Team USA with Team USA and WNBA superstar Sabrina Ionescu, and we are going to learn some tips and tools for success from the GOAT. All right, here we go. What type of challenges did you face growing up, and how did those adversities shape you into the person you are today?  SABRINA IONESCU, NEW YORK LIBERTY, WNBA:  There's just so many, but, you know, I would say one is not listening to people telling you what you should and shouldn't be. From a young age, especially being a girl in sports, everyone didn't think I belonged and didn't think that I should be playing, but I really didn't listen to the outside noise of what people thought, and I really just believed in the dreams that I had and worked really hard at getting to where I'm at today, and I'm really thankful for that.  WIRE:  What would you say is the secret to success?  IONESCU:  Just being the best version of yourself, committing yourself to working really hard and not letting, you know, the outside noise creep in and comparing yourself to other people, but just running your own race. WIRE:  You're a superstar athlete, but in school, how important was education and focusing on studying hard and getting good grades?  IONESCU:  It was everything. Being educated is a big part of your role as a professional athlete, being able to talk and have the knowledge of understanding what's going on in the world and how you can make it a better place. And so school has always been super important to me. I was able to get a master's in college and graduate with that, and so that was always at the forefront of what I wanted to accomplish.  WIRE:  I love that. All right, we're going to have a little bit of fun now. Do you have any hidden talent, like I can say the alphabet backwards really fast. Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T, S, R, Q, P, O, N, M, L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A. IONESCU:  I'm ambidextrous.  WIRE:  Really?  IONESCU:  Yes. But that's not as cool as that.  WIRE:  So like do you trade off, like, do you eat food sometimes with your left and right?  IONESCU:  Yes.  Yes, both. Yeah.  WIRE:  Just natural gift or did you work on that?  IONESCU:  I think naturally. But I've also worked on it.  WIRE:  Love it.  IONESCU:  Yes.  WIRE:  All right, you heard it here, keep shining, everyone. Remember, stay humble, stay hungry. I'm Coy Wire.  IONESCU:  I'm Sabrina Ionescu. WIRE:  And we are CNN --  IONESCU:  10.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  My goodness.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: What's up sunshine. Hope you had an awesome weekend and you're getting closer to your goals. If it feels like you're not this motivation Monday, remember this tough times make us tougher. Flowers that can thrive, growing up through cracks in a drive are better equipped to survive than those growing on country sides. We gain strength through our struggles.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start today with the latest scoop from Hollywood. The actor strike is over, ending an historic 118-day strike that, and put a pause on TV production, messed with movie releases and basically shut down a huge portion of the entertainment industry. At the heart of it all was the looming threat of Artificial Intelligence, potentially taking jobs. But now Hollywood studios in the whopping 160,000 actors represented by the SAG-AFTRA Union, well, shaken hands on a new three-year contract, that the union is calling an extraordinary billion-  dollar deal with pay bumps, AI protections, and streaming bonuses and improved benefits.  The actors first walked off July 14th with the Writers Guild union, the writers sorted out their issues back in September, but production remained halted while the actors kept the picket line going, trying to hash out their contract details. So it looks like it'll be light, camera, action once again in Hollywood. Here's our Brian Todd with more on the AI and other concerns that led to the strike in the first place and how it all got sorted out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: For nearly four months, stars like Jessica Chastain, Bob Odenkirk, and others walked the picket lines with their lesser-known colleagues during an actor strike that raised serious questions about whether the movie and TV industry, as we know it could survive.  But tonight, a sigh of relief, Hollywood actors have reached a tentative agreement with the major film and TV studios to end the strike.  FRAN DRESCHER, PRESIDENT, SAG-AFTRA: There is so much language in this contract that covers so much new ground that has never been in any of the contract before. TODD: Specific terms of the deal were not disclosed. And it still has to be ratified by the actors' union members. But according to a statement released by the union, the deal will give actors the famous and obscure a historic pay increase. SARA FISCHER, CNN MEDIA ANALYST: You have to remember SAG-AFTRA represents 160,000 workers. And these are not necessarily big time, rich actors. A lot of these folks are just starting out and living paycheck to paycheck. TODD: The agreement also gives actors better residuals for streaming programs, but at the center of the strike was the use of artificial intelligence, which Hollywood actors and writers have feared could someday replace them, or at least part of their work. The deal calls for actors to be able to have consent and compensation when an AI likeness of them is used. DUNCAN CRABTREE-IRELAND, CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, SAG-AFTRA: They're intended to be protections that not only will make sure that our members have the right to control the use of their image and likeness today. But as the technology develops and grows in the industry will continue to provide them with that kind of control. And it's so essential because it's really their persona that's being used. TODD: The actors and writers walkouts. The first time both entities had been on strike simultaneously in more than 60 years, proved incredibly costly over the course of the last six months. In September, California Governor Gavin Newsom estimated the loss for his state's economy was more than $5 billion. (On camera): While the actors are getting historically higher pay with this new deal, one industry analyst says there could be less work overall to go around for them in the future because he expects the studios and streaming services might start to reduce the numbers of TV shows and movies they order to save money. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Next up, a story you're going to lava. An underwater volcano erupted off the coast of Japan to form the world's newest island, formed on October 30th. It's about a hundred meters in diameter reaches as high as 20 meters according to the Japan meteorological agency. There has been increased underwater volcanic activity in this area in recent years, but the agency says the formation of this new island is significant. It popped up along the Japanese archipelago or group of islands, about 750 miles south of Japan in the Pacific Ocean. Only half a mile though, from the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. It doesn't have a name yet, so what would you call it?  Ten second trivia. Veterans day began with an observance that marked the end of what war?  U.S. Civil War, World War I, World War II or Vietnam war? The holiday observed on November 11 recalls Armistice Day, which barked the end of World War I. Now for a salute to the troops, Veterans Day in the U.S. is a federal holiday dedicated to recognizing the current and former members in all branches of the U.S. military. It honors the countless women and men who've served in sacrificed for the greater good of all of us, for the nation. The holiday is observed on November 11th each year, regardless of the day of the week. This year, it was Saturday. Many schools across the states though had Friday off to honor the occasion in recognition of all who've served.  CNN 10 is going to give us salute by exploring the 24-note bugle call referred to as taps. It's considered the nation's National Anthem of Remembrance. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) YARI VILLANEUVA, (ret.) U.S. AIR FORCE, TAPS FOR VETERANS: Of all the military bugle calls, not as more easily recognized, more apt to evoke emotion than the bugle call taps. Taps is our national song of remembrance. It's a bugle call that was started during the civil war and is actually started as a lights out call. But today is used as a final farewell to our military personnel.  My name is Yari Villaneuva. I am currently the President of Taps for Veterans, a nonprofit organization that helps provide live bugles for military funerals. Taps for veterans came about because we saw a need for live bugles at military funerals. In the late 1990s, a lot of the military bands were being downsized. And because of that there was a lack of military buglers available to play at funerals.  The electronic bugler has taken precedents over a live musician. And this is something that we thought we could address and something that we could do better. We could have a live bugler. That was the impetus performing Taps for Veterans.  We thought that it would be great to honor all veterans with a live performance of taps. And setting up a system whereby a family in need could reach out to us on our website and, and get a bugler so that we could honor that veteran we have. Well, over 1200 buglers around the country who are willing to step up and serve. The emotion of a person playing it, the music coming from their heart, you know, that goes through the tubing out. That's out to the people hearing it is really important. A live performance is just so -- so much preferable over than a recorded one. I mean, no one wants to go to a symphony hall and sit and listen to a recording of a symphony. They want to see and hear the live musicians playing that. We understand how important it is to have the recording. But it's really important and paramount that a live bugler be used, especially when you have one who's there willing to give their services to honor that veteran. And at the bottom line, that's what it's all about, honoring that veteran for his, or her service through our country. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is one that I could taco about all day long. Longwood, Florida, Nicole Castro and family could barely wait for 45 bucks worth of taco bell being delivered, but a big old burrito love and black bear barreled its way to the bounty and broke away with a baggage before they could snag it. The bear was estimated to be between 300 and 400 pounds. That was not your food, bear.  And we've got two special shoutouts on the YouTube version of our show today. We are showing some love to Union City, Middle and High School in Union City, Tennessee, let's go. And Nicollet Middle School in Burnsville, Minnesota, shine bright. Let's do this again tomorrow.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: What's up sunshine. It's Wednesday, November 15th, halfway through the week, and we're going to keep on grinding and shining because that's what we do. Thank you for your epic Your Word Wednesday submissions. See if your word made it in today's show.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start with the latest on the war between Israel and Hamas. We're getting access rarely seen to this point. CNN, along with other news media outlets was invited to embed with the Israel Defense Forces on a trip inside Gaza, to be very clear. Journalists traveled only with Israeli military and were limited to seeing only with Israeli military allowed them to see.  Now, you know, we've been showing you footage of what's happening from inside Gaza, where much of that has been coming from residents and local reporters who are already living inside Gaza, doing so under dangerous conditions. According to the committee to protect journalists, dozens of people have died while working to get the news out. Until now, the Israeli military has prevented outside journalists from entering the region with limited exceptions.  We're about to show you one of those exceptions, but first we want to zoom out to see the larger picture. The Israeli military has come under increasing condemnation because of its attacks around Gaza's hospitals. And because those hospitals are suffering without supplies or electricity, both limited by Israeli military activity.  The World Health Organization said there have been 137 attacks on hospitals in Gaza at the time we recorded this show, normally under international humanitarian law, hospitals are protected in times of war. Except when those sites are believed to be bases of military activity. While Hamas and medical officials in Gaza say hospitals there are not being used by Hamas militants, Israel is saying they are. And so Israel took members of the press, including CNN's Nic Robertson on a rare tour through Gaza, which you'll see right now.  CNN reported from Gaza under Israel Defense Forces escort at all times, CNN did not submit its script or footage to the IDF and has retained editorial control over the final report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Driving into Gaza with the Israeli forces, it's a war zone. The conditions of our access only show officers, no faces of soldiers and don't show sensitive equipment. We are passing mile after mile of destruction, buildings blown, collapsed nothing untouched by the fury of Israel's hunt for Hamas. Streets here crushed back to sand.  (On camera): Shops, everything that we see, no sign of any civilians here and the soldiers have been telling us that even inside the stores they've been fighting things like rocket propel grenades, ready to use against them as they were advancing through this area.  (Voice-over): A few miles in, we pull up at a command post. Soldiers living in blown apartment buildings.  (On camera): Every building I'm looking at here, wherever you turn is destroyed, it shut up, hard to imagine how civilians endured the bombardment here.  (Voice-over): Our next journey, much deeper into Gaza. We arrive a hundred meters from a battle with Hamas. Tanks blasting targets in nearby buildings. The IDF's top spokesperson, waiting for us.  BRIG. GEN. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL DEFENSE SPOKESPERSON: We're now conducting an operation inside Gaza, next to MTC (ph) Hospital.  ROBERTSON: Israel is facing massive international pressure over the destruction of homes, the shockingly high civilian death toll. And in the last few days over it's apparently heavy-handed tactics at hospitals. HAGARI: We are searching the tunnel with the bulldozers to reveal the tunnels that we suspect that underneath the hospital. ROBERTSON (voice-over): As we finally reached the hospital, it is already getting dark. A huge hole has been blasted through the walls, into the basement.  (On camera): Why is the hospital so damaged? We'll talk -- why is the hospital so damage like this? HAGARI: So I'll explain. It's an important question.  ROBERTSON: Yeah, it is.  HAGARI: We came to this hospital five days ago. There was still patients inside the hospital. We did not enter into the hospital. ROBERTSON: He claims since then all patients were evacuated by hospital staff. HAGARI: We assist this evacuation of course, to make it a safe pass for all the patients in the hospital. We do not know that the hospital is entirely clear. We do not know. We only entered to this area, which was -- which was suspected because we are being fired. ROBERTSON: Hagari leads us through a warren of basement corridors to this room. HAGARI: This was the armory. OK. This was the Hamas armory.  ROBERTSON: Yeah.  (Voice-over): He shows us a few rusting guns and some explosives. These guns alone have potentially huge implications for Gaza's hospitals. And Israel's apparent push to take control of them.  (On camera): The International Committee for the Red Cross say that hospitals are given special protection under international humanitarian law in a time of war. But if militant store weapons there or use them as a base of fire, then that protection falls away.  (Voice-over): In other rooms, he shows us a motorbike with a bullet hole in it that he suspects was used by Hamas attackers, October 7th.  (On camera): But the hospital authorities said they have no knowledge of Hamas or other groups inside their hospitals. Is that possible?  HAGARI: I think it's not possible for a hospital to have this kind of an infrastructure. We knew the terrorists were here. We knew --  ROBERTSON: How did you know?  HAGARI: We knew by intelligence and also we got some fire from this area. ROBERTSON: From this area, this building? HAGARI: From this area and we were right to fire because what we found an armory. ROBERTSON: But so much damage all around here. HAGARI: Yeah, there is damage all around here because Hamas made it impossible for us to fight them. They built all this infrastructure in tunnels and in hospital around areas populated. ROBERTSON (voice-over): As we exit the hospital, it is already dark.  (On camera): We're just getting ready to leave right now. The firefights still going on, still intense bullets fired explosions going on up the street there. (Voice-over): This war and the controverses surrounding it far from resolved. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Ten second trivia. In terms of sales, what is America's largest retailer?  Costco, Home Depot, Amazon, or Walmart? Your answer here is Walmart, topping the list almost doubling Amazon sales in 2022 with 600 billion.  Who's a fan of self-checkout outlines at your favorite retailer or grocery store? Some people love them. Some say I prefer a perfectly fine friendly human to help me with my purchases, please.  Well, some major retailers are starting to say goodbye to self-checkout lines. The machines were first introduced in the 1980s becoming more widely used in the early 2000s as stores look to cut costs and higher fewer cashiers. Well it turns out that utilizing self-service stations are actually leading to greater losses than human cashiers. Whether it be from accidental customer errors or from intentional shoplifting.  One study found incontrovertible proof that companies with self-checkout machines had a loss rate of about 4%. That's more than double the industry average. Some attempts to fix these issues like adding weight sensors have only led to further customer frustration.  So far Walmart, ShopRite, Costco and the U.K.'s boots have all started to dial back their self-checkout strategy. What do you say? Good idea or bad idea?  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 highlights the power of imagination. You've often heard me say that if there's something you want to achieve, you have to see it before you see it. Meaning you see it in your mind's eye before you actually see it come to fruition.  Well, first grade teacher, Ms. Sonja White at Trinity Leadership School in Texas, wanted to give her students an imaginary experience of taking a trip on an airplane. But what ended up happening was a dream come true. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Texas teacher, Sonja White staged a mock trip to Mexico for her students. SONJA WHITE: I'm going to change my classroom into an airplane. MOOS: The first graders at Trinity Leadership School flew Southwest airlines. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Where are you going? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mexico. MOOS: With their carryon luggage and even neck pillows. WHITE: So now I'm a TSA agent. MOOS: A video of takeoff set the move. Their teacher transformed into a flight attendant. WHITE: Apple juice. MOOS: After an apparently bumpy landing, look at this kid's face. They arrived in Mexico. WHITE: They are going through customs. I am now a customs agent. MOOS: The trip went viral, got rave reviews, best teacher ever.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello sunshine. Let's get our energy up, up, up. It's Thursday, November 16th. Happy Friday Eve. I'm Coy Wire. We are CNN 10. And we start with a gathering of world leaders. This week in San Francisco, the United States is hosting representatives from the APEC or the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation. And that's just what it is. APEC formed in 1989 is now made up of 21 countries that all touched the Pacific Ocean from Thailand to Australia to Chile.  Now, these countries work together to create agreements that help strengthen the members' economies by improving relations and promoting trade. Now, one way they can do that is by limiting tariffs. A tariff is a tax added to goods coming in from other countries. The thinking is that when imports are more expensive, people will be more inclined to buy goods that are already made at home. But countries love and need to export to bring more money into their economy. So limiting tariffs between each other that can be friendly and profitable. Tariffs, the climate and the war in the Middle East are just a few of the many topics up for discussion at this year's APEC summit. There's also a much-anticipated meeting between U.S. President, Joe Biden, and China's President, Xi Jinping. Here's Marc Stewart with more (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  This highly anticipated meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden is a big deal. It was in February that a Chinese balloon was shot down over American airspace, adding even more tension to an already frosting relationship.  But things have since stabilized during this highly anticipated meeting in California, don't expect the two sides to come to an agreement on authority issues such as Taiwan or human rights. But rather officials say this is an opportunity to set some barriers and limit to create some calm between the two nations.  Right now, both nations are witnessing the war in Ukraine, as well as the war between Israel and Hamas. This meeting is a chance to prevent the relations between the U.S. and China, from deteriorating, with the goal of creating some stability. Despite the differences, this is also a chance to build on economic relations. As both nations have benefited from trade.  This meeting comes as both President Xi and President Biden face domestic challenges of their own. Marc Stewart, CNN Beijing.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, there is a milk shortage in cafeterias all across the country, but it's not because there's not enough milk to go around. The U.S. Department of Agriculture or USDA says multiple states are affected by supply chain issues related to packaging. It's a dairy precarious situation for distributors who sell cartons of milk to places like schools, nursing homes and correctional facilities. They're running out of the cartons that hold the milk. Typically public schools are required to offer fat free 1% or flavored milk at breakfast and lunch. But the USDA is relaxing these requirements for now. As some schools are transitioning to alternatives like juice, shelf stable milk, and bottled water. Some have even considered pouring individual cups from big jugs of milk themselves. There's no certain timeframe for when this shortage might end. Ten second trivia.  Maputo is the capital city of what African nation? Mozambique, Morocco, Mali, or Madagascar? Maputo is a port city, the largest city and capital city of Mozambique. That's the correct answer here.  All right, let's dive on in now to the aqua marine waters around Mozambique considered some of the richest in the world, full of fauna and marine life. It's a hotspot for people who love to dive. And for researchers looking to work with coastal sea life. The diving industry there could be a big part of the local economy by employing Mozambicans and by helping to promote sustainability, could be but it's not, at least not yet. Check this out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Mozambique has one of the longest coastlines in Africa, with an abundance in marine life.  ANDREA MARSHALL, CO-FOUNDER, MARINE MEGAFAUNA FOUNDATION:  In some areas of the world, you can go and dive with whales, or you can go and dive with whale sharks, or you can go and dive with mantas. Here we have it all. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Making it a prime spot for divers, boosting local jobs and ocean conservation. MARSHALL:  One of the things that the diving community can do is shine a light on, on some of these areas, especially here in Africa that have been so undervalued for so long. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is Mozambique's diving scene. MARSHALL:  I was just so enthralled by what I saw here. I just -- I mean, you could walk over the backs of mantas and whale sharks. They littered the surface of the water and just so many megafauna  whales and dolphins and marlin jumping out. And I just thought, what is this place? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  World Renown Conservation Biologist, Andrea Marshall, has been working in Mozambique for past 20 years. MARSHALL:  I was talking to people about, you know, these diving destinations that revolve around a single species. People will fly across the world to go to a location where you can dive with humpbacks or people will fly across the world to go to a destination with just whale sharks. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Nicknamed clean of the mantas for her pioneering research work on manta rays. Andrea is using her fame to highlight other endangered species and ocean habitats. MARSHALL:  Over the course of my career, I started to see that there was a lot of anti-anthropogenic threats that were starting to creep in. we started to see a lot of influence from industrial fishing moving in, and even the artesian fishermen that -- that are kind of subsistence fishing along the coast, started using more aggressive gears, like long lines and gill nets here. And I started to see a decline in a lot of the populations of the animals that we were studying.  And so I realized that when I finished my Ph.D., if I was to move on that none of this information would be captured that this conservation probably wouldn't take off here. And so for us, it meant, well, if we're going to take this journey, it might be a 40 or 50- or 60-year journey, but I'm all in. I mean, that's, what I want to do is, is protect this coastline. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Andrea believes that a thriving dive industry will help make ocean conservation a bigger priority for local communities. MARSHALL:  Connecting people with nature is the most powerful way to be able to effectively switch that light on and make them care. One of the things I'm really excited about is the synergy that's forming here in the coastal communities between dive center operators and government, scientists, other stakeholders, basically everybody wants the same thing. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And as the diving team develops further, Andrea is keen for sustainability to be a priority. MARSHALL:  Tourism actually is one of the biggest threats to the environment that you can get. And it's been shown through a lot of different scientific studies.  We also have to be careful with how we develop tourism. The dive centers here in Mozambique, because they're working with researchers, have become really aware of, you know, what the limits are and how they probably don't want to develop this area too quickly. Because it's very difficult to wind things back when they get out of control. It's much better to develop things slowly and sustainably. We have to show caution and we just have to put the animals and the environments first. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's story, getting a 10 out of 10, we're drawing attention to the world's largest pencil collection. Aaron Bartholmey of Iowa got into his hobby of pencil collecting as a first grader, collecting everywhere from local businesses to flea markets. He even has a pencil that's 100 years old.  Now, Aaron didn't know how many of them he had until he learned the Guinness World Record was 24,000. But I hope the old record wasn't written in pencil because when Aaron put in the work of counting all of his 69,255 pencils, he became the new Guinness world record holder. And even though his collection has already rewritten the record books, he's already in the hunt for more. Right on Aaron. Well done. I'm more of a pen guy. Pencils are kind of sketchy.  I have some puns about broken pencils, I could tell, but they're pointless. That technically wasn't our top 10 out of 10. It was a number two. Our best story today is going to you, especially the superstars at Woodlawn Leadership Academy in Shreveport, Louisiana, Knight, you keep on shining bright. And Whitefish High School, the Bulldogs in Whitefish, Montana. Much love, many blessings, I've got a date with you. Pins within for tomorrow, Friday. I'm Coy Wire. And we are CNN 10. END231117

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up sunshine, go on and smell the flowers and cool the soup. It's Friday. We are going to finish this week, strong kick our weekend off, right? I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, it's Friday, November 17th. And we start with some travel news.  If you're traveling for Thanksgiving, have some patience because next week is expected to be the busiest in years. The American Automobile Association or AAA predicts that more than 55 million people will be traveling during the five-day period from Wednesday to Sunday.  Now, if you're traveling by plane, the transportation security administration expects a record high number of travelers at American airports. On the Sunday after Thanksgiving alone, TSA is preparing to screen nearly 3 million people at airports across the nation. So bring a good game, bring a book, something to brace yourself for potentially long lines.  There is a positive here though. Demand for travel has just continued to grow after the pandemic and post-COVID work trends with hybrid and remote schedules. Now, let people leave for the holidays at different times. That might be good news for drivers say, because the longer travel period could make the usual peak traffic days, a little less busy than they used to be like. Can you guess what those days are? The Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the Sunday after. Still most Americans may be returning from the holidays on Sunday. That'll make it the busiest air travel day of the year. That's according to the aviation firm Cirium. It expects airlines to fly more than 3 million seats on 22,000 flights that day. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you are traveling over the Thanksgiving holiday, pack your patients, it's expected to be a record setting travel season in the skies and a busy one on the roads. AIXA DIAZ, AAA SPOKESWOMAN:  The trend is that, people are still traveling in very large volumes.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  AAA is forecasting 55.4 million people will be traveling to their holiday destinations, including more than 49 million who will drive to their destination between the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the Sunday after the holiday, if you are hitting the road, AAA says that Wednesday afternoon is still the worst time to hit the roads with AAA recommending you leave on actual Thanksgiving day.  DIAZ:  It shortens the amount of time that you're at your destination, but it also shortens the amount of time that you're in transit. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The Sunday after Thanksgiving is also brutal, but not as busy as it could be. DIAZ:  Hybrid schedules and remote schedules have changed everything because now people can leave for holiday travel at different times. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you are taking to the skies, brace yourself for packed airports and possible delays and cancellations, the transportation security administration is bracing for an all-time record number of passengers at airports nationwide on this Sunday after Thanksgiving.  So what can you do to minimize the chaos at the airport? One travel expert says avoid checking a bag in case your flight gets canceled and you're moved to a different one, take public transit to the airport or book your parking spot online now, and finally give yourself plenty of time, be flexible and very patient. SCOTT KEYES, FOUNDER OF GOING.COM:  There's always going to be some amount of cancellation that happen as long as we have bad weather. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, we're headed to the south Asian country of Nepal. Nepal's government decided to ban TikTok. They say it was disrupting family and social structures. Nepal isn't the only country where a popular app with 1 billion monthly active users is now banned. India put a ban on TikTok three years ago, and the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand put restrictions on the app because of security concerns. Nepal, however, had a different reason to ask internet providers to cut access to TikTok throughout the country. Citing local media, Reuters reported that more than 1,600 TikTok related cybercrime cases have been registered over the last four years in Nepal. Nepal's Prime Minister said that the government had a long discussion on how to control the tendency to spread disharmony, disorder, and chaos in society and decided that a ban on TikTok was needed.  Now pop quiz, hot shot. Ten second trivia. Which state has the lowest population density in the U.S.? Hawaii, Alaska, Montana, or Wyoming? Wyoming has the lowest population overall, but Alaska, which is by far, the largest state has the lowest population density. All right, we're headed to Alaska now where this weekend a town in the very Northern part of the U.S., which is located north of the Arctic circle will see the sun for the last time in two months, our Meteorologist Allison Chinchar is here to explain why ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: That's right, Coy. Just before 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, the sun will go down in the town of Utqiagvik, Alaska, formerly known as Barrow. And it will not come back again for 66 more days. That's right, the sun go down on Saturday and comes back on January 23rd of next year.  Now, this happens every single year. It's called polar night, and it's a common occurrence for a lot of these areas and what we call the Arctic circle. So here you can see exactly where the town is located at the very northernmost point of Alaska, putting it inside the Arctic circle. That means for several weeks during the winter, they go into a phase of complete darkness. The sun never fully rises.  Now, on the flip side, Coy, in the summer, the opposite happens where they will have 24 straight hours of daylight as the sun never truly sets for several weeks in the summer. WIRE:  Today's story, getting a 10 out of 10, an unusual new use of fall foliage. By the way, did you know that warm colors of autumn leaves are always present? They're just hidden by the abundance of green chlorophyll during the warmer months. You see in the fall leaves stop their food making process and the chlorophyll declines. The green color fades away to reveal all the other colors hidden beneath.  Now, check this out, at the Point Defiance Zoo in Tacoma, Washington, a baby ox named Willow came up with a fun way to enjoy the new fall foliage. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  You know how in the fall zoos are always giving their animals, squashes to squish, pumpkins to spear with their horns, the zoos call it enrichment. It gives the animals something new to do and a photo-op for the press.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is her first time with a big leaf pile.  MOOS:  We think you'll really fall for this fall ritual featuring Willow. the baby muskox. Willow is a little over two months old. She lives with her mother, Charlotte. Willow was born here at the Point Defiance Zoo in Tacoma, Washington, a girl who loves to headbutt her red ball and splash around, in puddles, and now this.  (On camera):  Willow really seems to be in the fall foliage. TELENA WELSH, CURATOR, POINT DEFIANCE ZOO:  She loves it. The leaves are one of her favorite things MOOS:  Raked into a pile by the keepers. WELSH:  And she just went wild.  MOOS:  The name Willow totally suits her because it's one of her favorite foods, but the pile consists of maple leaves.  WELSH:  If it was all Willow leaves, she'd probably eat that entire batch of leaves. MOOS:  Eat it rather than frolic in it. Either one is a barrel of fun. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  What an awesome week we've had. We took you to Japan, to Iceland. We followed the stories from the depth of the ocean to the mountaintops. We learned a lot, laughed a little and showed a whole bunch of love.  Shout out time. Cinnaminson Middle School in Cinnaminson, New Jersey go Pirates. And shout out to, Mighty Spartans at W.T.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: What's up lovely people. It's our last show of the week as the team and hopefully all of you get to take a few days away to ruminate on all that we can be thankful for in this world. One thing we're grateful for, you especially all our educators out there. Let's make this a teacher time Tuesday, shall we? Go on and give your teacher a handshake, high five or fist bump. Let them know, I see you. Keep on inspiring, uplifting and gifting us with your love for learning.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start today with news on the passing of former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, wife of the 39th President of the United States, Jimmy Carter. In a statement from the Carter Center, the nonprofit organization founded by the former President and First Lady, Ms. Rosalynn passed away peacefully with her family by her side at her home in Georgia on Sunday.  Mrs. Carter was diagnosed with dementia in May, then entered hospice care toward the end of last week. She was 96 years old.  Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter were married for more than 77 years, longer than any couple to have taken up residence at the White House.  President Carter served as a single-term president from 1977 to 1981, but the couple was very active in their post-White House years. Rosalynn played an instrumental role for their humanitarian work by establishing the Carter Center and being an advocate for affordable housing while working alongside Habitat for Humanity for more than 30 years.  Rosalynn was her husband's heart and soul. The former President said in a statement, "Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished. She gave me wise guidance, and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me." Ceremonies for the former First Lady are slated to take place next week. More now on Rosalynn Carter's legacy and reaction from President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tributes continue pouring in for the late Rosalynn Carter.  JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT: They're really an incredible family because they brought so much grace to the office. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The former First Lady died Sunday after entering hospice care on Friday. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She was well known for her efforts on mental health and caregiving and women's rights. So I hope that during the holidays you'll consider saying -- you include the Carter family in your prayers.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mrs. Carter was actively involved in her husband's presidency and a strong advocate for equal treatment of the mentally ill.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nobody talked to each other about their own mental illness at all. And now to see that actually people can recover is the greatest thing.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But it was the couple's work after leaving the White House that would leave the longest legacy redefining and revolutionizing the post-presidency.  In 1981, they spearheaded a new challenge, joining with Habitat for Humanity, building houses for the poor. A year later, they established the Carter Center, a foundation devoted to promoting human rights, resolving conflicts and eradicating diseases.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm proud of the work of the Carter Center, which has developed to become one of the most admired and respected institutions, not only nationally but internationally.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Ten second trivia.  On which island chain would you find the town of Kitty Hawk, where the first airplane flight was made?  Outer Banks, Florida Keys, Sea Islands, or Elizabeth Islands?  If you said Outer Banks, put your hands up. Back in 1903, the right flyer made the first piloted airplane flight on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Our next story is pretty fly. It's about some students who could very well be the right brothers and sisters of the now. They spend their school week in an airplane hangar at JFK Airport in Queens at the Aviation Career and Technical High School. They take traditional school courses, but they also get their hands on mechanic training to help propeller them on a path in the aviation industry.  Put your lap trays and seat backs in the upright and locked position. Let's go.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY SUMBA, STUDENT AT AVIATION HIGH SCHOOL: There's a lot of opportunity in this aviation that a lot of high school don't have.  (OFF MIC) WIRE: These aren't paid airplane mechanics or professional repair technicians. They're students at Aviation High School in Queens, New York.  STEVEN R. JACKSON, PRINCIPAL AT AVIATION HIGH SCHOOL: Aviation High School is a public New York City high school that is also a federal aviation administration regulated aviation maintenance school. We are one of the largest in the country. All the traditional high school coursework plus hands-on work that can get them a job in the aviation industry right after high school.  WIRE: At Aviation, students learn every aspect of the plane. They specialize in certifications that allow them to succeed in careers in aircraft management and manufacturing, taking on roles as airplane mechanics, air traffic controllers, and flight dispatchers as soon as they graduate.  JACKSON: We want to make sure that they're in class every day, that they're studying every day, that they're getting all their jobs done properly. Because again, there's people's lives at stake when they get into their workforce to work on airplanes that we all fly.  JAMES DASCAOU, STUDENT AT AVIATION HIGH SCHOOL: You know there's like so many different parts of the plane that you really need to have some idea of each section and really every single class prepares you somewhat for that road into the aviation field.  WIRE: Like other career and technical high schools, Aviation High struggles with recruiting women. In fact, women make up less than 10% of all skilled trade jobs across the country.  ALEXIS CONNO, STUDENT AT AVIATION HIGH SCHOOL: I think in any class I'm in, there's less than 10 girls in that class. Every day, I feel like I have to prove myself, and that's hard. But it's very rewarding when I finish at the same pace that the boys do.  WIRE: Getting into Aviation High isn't easy. In 2023, just over 4,000 applicants competed for only 500 seats at the school. Students traveled by train, bus, and ferry from all over New York City commuting up to two and half hours to attend the school.  SUMBA: So it's very early mornings. Sometimes, like currently I have to be here about like 6:30 because I'm coming to practice in for my licensing. I mean, it's worth the commute to come here to do what I'm doing right now. But it is sometimes very lengthy.  JACKSON: Vocational programs are definitely now getting a lot more focus and schools like ours that are aligned with the industry that has huge need of course is creating another major focus for education systems across the country. The numbers they're predicting the desire for airlines to find technicians yesterday is already felt so it's something that we're dealing with. They're putting together packages to try and lure technicians to their company because the need is so huge. CONNO: You see the world and you're not locked down at a desk. You're always doing something different.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: All right, all you turkeys, we are headed right into the middle and maybe the madness of Thanksgiving week, specifically when it comes to travel. This is expected to be the busiest, our roadways and airways have been in years. On top of that, we're also looking down the eye of some serious storms. Old Mother Nature will be making herself felt in full force with rain, snow and severe storms set to impact large portions of the U.S.  Our inimitable and magnificent meteorologist, Allison Chinchar is here to break it all down.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: As you pack your bags to travel this holiday week, you may also want to pack your patients as Mother Nature could add delays both in the air and on the roadways. A low-pressure system developing over the central U.S. on Sunday will slide eastward in the coming days, bringing the chance of rain, snow, high winds, and even possible tornadoes.  By Monday, the system focuses over the Midwest and the Southeast with nearly 20 million people under the threat for severe storms along the Gulf Coast. Tuesday is when the real problems begin, especially if you have flights in or out of the main connecting airports in the eastern half of the country, including New York, D.C., Charlotte, Atlanta, and Chicago.  As for the roadways, rain will lead to soggy conditions at times for Interstates 95, 85, 75, 40, and 70. There will also be a rain-snow mix for the upper Midwest and interior New England.  (END VIDEOTAPE) For today's story, getting a 10 out of 10, let's head to the White House South Lawn where President Joe Biden continued the annual American presidential tradition of pardoning a turkey. To pardon means to forgive. And in this instance, the pardoning means that the president is sparing the turkeys from being served alongside pumpkin pies, mashed potatoes, and casseroles. The pardoning of a turkey is one of the traditional White House Thanksgiving festivities, marking an opportunity to give thanks as the holiday season begins.  After their pardoning, this year's turkeys, Liberty and Belle, will be relocated to a farm to gobble and play for the rest of their days.  You all hold the turkeys to our heart. We're going to miss you the rest of the week as we start our Thanksgiving break.  But last but not fist, it's time for shout outs. We couldn't make this show without you, so we're sending some love to all of you, particularly to Village Middle School in Colorado Springs, Colorado, a rocky mountain salute to all of you. And shout out to Sterling Heights High School and Sterling Heights, Michigan, rise Up. From me and my team, we are so thankful for you. We wish you a safe, healthy, happy Thanksgiving.  I'm Coy Wire. I'll be right back with you on Monday. It was a blessing to spend part of this week with you. END231122

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, sunshine. Hope you had an awesome Thanksgiving break. It is November 27th, Motivation Monday, and to honor it, a quote from former South African President and Social Rights Activist Nelson Mandela, who once said, it always seems impossible until it is done.  We start today with something that once may have seemed impossible for many of those affected by the conflict in the Middle East, but it has happened. And a breakthrough, truce deal Israel and Hamas agreed on a temporary pause in fighting and the first large scale release of hostages and prisoners who were taken on October 7th.  It began on Friday when 24 hostages left Gaza and 39 Palestinian women and minors were released from Israeli prisons. Over the weekend, we continued to see the emotional reunions of families who hadn't seen each other for weeks.  Under a four-day truce deal, Israel and Hamas agreed on the release of a total of 50 hostages from Gaza and 150 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.  Now we're going to zip on over to our next story of the day. In the U.S., Black Friday, the Friday after Thanksgiving is not what it used to be. Years ago, Black Friday's shopping crazes could sometimes lead to stampede, even injuries at stores, but now American consumers' habits around the holiday shopping season have changed. Here's Jenn Sullivan with the how and the why.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENN SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: In the end discount dash associated with Black Friday appears to be slowing.  JEFF GENNETT, CEO OF MACY'S: Clearly the month of November has changed really since the pandemic.  SULLIVAN: More shoppers are looking to score deals online as many consumers gear up for Cyber Monday.  CLAIRE TASSIN, MORNING CONSULT RETAIL & E-COMMERCE ANALYST: A pretty big shift from the Black Fridays. I remember about a decade ago where people would line up early outside the stores now people are shopping in their pajamas.  SULLIVAN: It's not just the convenience of shopping from home that has consumers scaling back on in-store shopping. Many retailers rolled out their discounts much earlier this year to entice people to spend sooner.  HARLEY FINKELSTEI, PRESIDENT OF SHOPIFY: It actually started as early as early October and will go right until Christmas time.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: The Black Friday deals have already generated nearly $10 billion in online sales, according to Adobe Analytics. That's 7.5% more than a year ago. But Black Friday is only the penultimate attempt by retailers to ratchet up their sales.  Today, marks the final substantial day of holiday shopping deals Cyber Monday, designed for online shoppers. Did you know that Cyber Monday is expected to generate a record $12 billion in sales, according to Adobe Analytics. Adobe says smartwatches, TVs, toys, and gaming products were the best-selling categories this year. They also saw a notable increase in shoppers who went for buy now, pay later options, 47% more Americans use this flexible payment method compared to last year. And while that may mean that they may end up paying a bit more because of interest, that works better for some.  Now, pop quiz, hot shot. Ten-second trivia. What is the oldest operating ballpark in Major League Baseball?  Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, Dodger Stadium, or Yankee Stadium?  Opening in 1912 Fenway Park with its iconic left field wall opened two years before Wrigley. Although baseball season might be over in the U.S., one of the sport's most iconic venues is still active in an unexpected way. As we celebrate our shared home, this call to Earth Day, CNN went to the city of Boston to take a look at an urban farm unlike any other, sitting above the front offices of the Boston Red Sox.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Hours before the gates open on a Red Sox game day in late August at Fenway Park in Boston, a different team is hard at work.  CHRIS GRALLERT, PRESIDENT, GREEN CITY GROWERS: As these crops continue to come out, we're plant in fall greens, we're plant in lettuces.  WIRE: This is Fenway Farms, a 5,000 square foot garden area on a section of rooftop at the oldest active Major League Baseball Park in America.  GRALLERT: You know agriculture happens everywhere we're just bringing it up off the ground and putting it up on a roof.  WIRE: Chris Grallert is a farmer and the president of Green City Growers, which operates this farm in some 200 other locations, including at 40 Boston Public Schools. But none are as visible and perhaps surprising as Fenway Farms.  GRALLERT: There's a desire for people to have more locally grown fresh produce and interact with the people who are growing and distributing that fresh produce. And I think when you have such high visibility like you do at a garden like this, people start to see that it's possible and it can really be the seed to start the new revolution towards food system transformation.  WIRE: The garden first opened in 2015, recycled milk crates formed the raised planters.  GRALLERT: These are fingerling type potatoes.  WIRE: Irrigated by a special system that delivers the precise amount needed to each plant.  The produce doesn't have to travel far, just a short walk to Chef Ron Abel and his team. Operating the restaurants and concessions at Fenway.  GRALLERT: Produce delivery.  RON ABEL, SENIOR EXECUTIVE CHEF, FENWAY PARK: How you doing buddy?  GRALLERT: Good to see you as always.  ABEL: What do you have? GRALLERT: Beautiful onions, right off, look at the size of those.  ABEL: I have the best chef job in the city. Well, actually, maybe the country where I've got a rooftop garden that the food travels 100 feet, gets washed, and gets served to everybody. And then this dish that Sean's putting together is simple. Potatoes we harvested this morning, we've got purple potatoes, we've got fingerling potatoes, heirloom carrots of different colors, and he just steamed them lightly, and they get seasoned lightly.  WIRE: Green City Growers estimates Fenway Farms reduces the need for produce to purchase at the venue by 20%.  ABEL: Mostly we look at quantities and what we can go through and we also look at perishability. So there are challenges here. We can't predict what mother nature is going to give us.  WIRE: Anything left over, along with what's harvested from a smaller designated area next to the main farm, is donated to a local food rescue and distribution organization called Lovin' Spoonfuls.  GRALLERT: We can produce anywhere from four to six thousand pounds of fresh produce a year depending on what we're growing. And so the range of vegetables, asparagus, and zucchini.  WIRE: Making the iconic green of Fenway Park even greener.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Today's story getting a 10 out of 10, the great escape. Shelley Betz from Georgia and her family were busy decorating their home for Christmas and when it was time to clean up all the mess, their robot vacuum was nowhere to be found until they found video evidence of the mysterious getaway. Here's Jeanne Moos with more.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Roomba is supposed to work for you.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Alexa, can you tell Roomba to clean under the kitchen table? MOOS: But who knew a Roomba could turn the tables by disappearing? SHELLEY BETZ, ROOMBA OWNER: We could not find him. And we looked under all the furniture. MOOS: Unbeknownst the Georgia resident, Shelley Betz, Roomba headed out the front door. They'd left open. BETZ: We were doing Christmas decorations in and out, and he escaped. MOOS: Two days later, Shelley's husband found him under a bunch of leaves.  (On camera): How far did he actually get? BETZ: To be honest, he didn't get very far. MOOS: Maybe 10 yards. It was after they found him that they looked back at their ring camera and witnessed his escape. BETZ: We were laughing hysterically. MOOS: So was the internet, the little Roomba that could, now that's a clean getaway. Clean, but Roomba was a mess. He lost his padding and his brushes though he still works. BETZ: He did his job. You know, he was doing what he's he was born to do. MOOS: So she saluted the runaway Roomba's escape by adding the George Michael classic. (MUSIC) MOOS: Without Roomba, the family was left in a vacuum. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Shout out time now. We're showing love to Campbell Middle School in Smyrna, Georgia, rise up.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: What's up sunshine. So grateful to be with you today. I'm Coy Wire. Welcome to CNN 10. I lost my voice. Yep. I was outside in the cold yesterday, not wearing my jacket. And here we are. So bear with me. Now, I'm pumped to see your submissions for tomorrow's #YourWordWednesday. Follow me @coywire on Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, put your unique vocabulary word and definition in the comment section on my most recent post in the team, we're going to choose a winner to work into tomorrow's show.  All right, we start today with a story about the war we haven't talked about much recently. It's been nearly two years since the war between Russia and Ukraine began back in February of 2022. Just a couple of days ago, Russia launched its largest drone attack against Ukraine's capital of Kyiv since the full-scale invasion began. According to local officials, Ukraine's air force says they intercepted 71 Iranian made drones in six regions of Ukraine with the vast majority in the Kyiv region, 77 residential buildings were left without power for several hours before supply was restored.  The next day, Russian officials reported they foiled more than 20 Ukrainian drone attacks over Russian territory, including the capital Moscow. Russian air defenses also intercepted 53 Ukrainian drones over Ukrainian areas under Russian control. That's according to the ministry of defense. There is no quick end in sight for the war between Russia and Ukrainian. And both are preparing for the long haul.  President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is asking Western allies for continued support with more advanced arms, ammunition, and financing. Germany recently admitted that European target goals for providing ammunition would fall short and the White House made it clear that the money U.S. has available for Ukraine military aid is quickly running out. As Congress remains divided over funding additional support.  One of the problems that more funding could possibly help solve is a shortage of drones in Ukraine. CNN's Anna Coren explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On the outskirts of Kyiv, a soldier puts on a pair of goggles.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Welcome to OpenTX. COREN: She's part of a unit testing the latest batch of drones that have just arrived. Some work, some don't. But this is the place to find out before they're delivered to Ukrainian troops on the Eastern and Southern fronts. Some of these drones are from civilians, produced in homes on kitchen tables. They can be used for reconnaissance or assault missions. COREN (on camera): Drones have become a critical component of this war and are absolutely essential to every single Ukrainian unit on the front line. And while civilians are working with private companies and the military to produce as many drones as possible, these soldiers say they are not nearly enough. COREN (voice-over): As Russia's full-scale invasion approaches a second year, there is now a critical shortage of drones. China's decision to shut down exports of parts, citing national security concerns, is part of the problem. However, the biggest issue is Russian electronic warfare. A Ukrainian official tells CNN, the military uses roughly 30,000 to 40,000 drones per month. They're cheap and expendable. But soldiers on the ground say they need at least 10 times more.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: We live in a world where artificial intelligence is becoming a bigger part of our lives, potentially writing messages, creating images and art. And if it feels like AI is getting so good, that it's difficult for you to figure out what's real or not real sometimes, you're not alone in that search. Many people are looking for authenticity. And in 2023, authentic is Miriam Webster's official word of the year. A synonym of real and actual authentic has several meanings, including true to one's own personality, spirit, or character.  The dictionary publisher says there have been a high volume of searches this year using the term driven by stories and conversations around AI, celebrity, culture, identity, and social media.  Celebrities like Taylor Swift, Lainey Wilson, and Sam Smith made headlines this year when they spoke about seeking their authentic voice in authentic self. Elon Musk also loves the term as he has previously said, people should be more authentic on social media.  I hope that you always have the strength to show your authentic self to the world. The moment we try to be like someone else, well, that's when we lose the magic that makes us special. There is no one in the world like you. You are more powerful than you know. Ten second trivia. Which of these countries does the Amazon Rainforest NOT cover? Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay or Brazil? Paraguay is your answer here. The Amazon Rainforest, the world's largest tropical rainforest spans approximately 2.6 million square miles in south America covering parts of eight countries, one territory, but not Paraguay. Today is called to earth day. And we're celebrating our shared home shedding light on how our actions can impact distant natural spaces and what we can do to protect and nurture them.  Next, we're going to head to the Tropical Andes where biologists Ruthmerry Pillco Huarcaya is participating in the National Geographic and Rolex Perpetual Planet Amazon Expedition, researching one of the ecosystem's most iconic and endangered species. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAIN ASHER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voice-over): High above the Amazon Rainforest crossing the borders of Ecuador, Columbia, and Peru is the Andean Cloud Forest. It might sound like something plucked from a fairytale, but it is very much real. And it's one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet. RUTHMERRY PILLCO HUARCAYA, COORDINATOR, ANDEAN BEAR PROJECT: The Cloud Forest has its name because most of the time it's covered by cloud. Here we have the trees with an array of orchids, mosses and many other epiphytes that are recovering the trees and they act like sponge. They capture the moisture and is helping to take back the water into the system. So, playing a key role in this way.  ASHER: Alongside the thousands of species of red plants and 00:06:45 stone Budds lives one of south America's most iconic mammals. PILLCO HUARCAYA: The Andean Bear is the only bear we have here in South America. They are medium-sized bears in comparison to their cousin, the North American Bears. The main characteristic is the facial markings. So many of them have white facial markings that look like spectacles. That's why also they are called Spectacled Bears. So these facial markings are unique for each individual. It's how we can identify different individuals. ASHER: The Andean Bear is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN with fewer than 10,000 remaining. Ruthmerry has spent the past two years studying the remaining population in the Cloud Forest in order to develop a conservation strategy for the species. Using camera traps and tracking collars, the Andean Bear Project is accumulating a database of the creatures habits and the role they play in the ecosystem. MARK THOMAS, RESEARCHER & DATA ANALYST, ANDEAN BEAR PROJECT: We basically get a deep dive into the life of an Andean Bear. We basically are able to see where it spends most of its time. So is it in like Puna grasslands, upper mountain forest. We can also see how it interacts, for example, with the roads that we have that go on here.  The communities rely on these kind of cloud forests or habitats as much as the bears do. For us, understanding all of this information, it gives us the opportunity to be able to work on the, where do we need to protect? What do we need to protect. PILLCO HUARCAYA: For conservation to have success, we need to work with people and in this case we need to work with local community are that are the neighbors of Manu National Part, of this forest. It's like a chain of information. Our forest is water, and water is life. Not only for plants or animals but also for us humans. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: Today's story getting 10 out of 10 is lit. Look at this delightful sight shining at the world's largest Christmas light maze. The enchant experience is a winter wonderland in Kansas City, Kansas. It took more than a month to build it. And it's an immersive experience. The website says, a mischievous little elf named Eddie misplaced eight toys meant for kids. And the goal is to find them before Santa's big night. All while you get your glow on amid more than 4 million lights.  That looks amazing. If you love Christmas time, that place will make you love it a lot more.  Now it's shout out time and we are showing lots of love to Grace Webb High School in Hartford, Connecticut. Thank you for spending part of your day with us. And this shout out goes to Redmond High School in Redmond, Oregon. Go Panthers, keep shining great sunshine. And I look forward to all of Your Word Wednesday submissions. I'm Coy Wire.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. And hello, Wednesday. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. We got a big show today. Not a lot of time to do it. So let's get to it.  We start with the news that might be especially relevant. If you use social media apps like Instagram and Facebook to catch you up to speed, a federal lawsuit was filed last month against Meta, the social media giant that owns those apps. It accuses the company of harming minors and contributing to a mental health crisis in the U.S.  And now a newly unsealed court document reveals some of the details of that lawsuit. It claims Meta knowingly refused to shut down accounts of users under the age of 13 and accuses the company of collecting children's personal information without their parents' consent. The unsealed complaint also alleges Meta knew its algorithm could steer children toward harmful content.  Instagram's term of use does prohibit users under the age of 13, but attorney generals from 33 states argue Meta disabled only a fraction of the accounts reported to the company for violating this rule since 2019. Meta responded to the unsealed complaint by telling CNN, "We want teens to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online, and we have over 30 tools to support them and their parents." Now, the company says they spent a decade working on these issues and that they have hired people who have dedicated their careers to keeping young people safe and supported online, adding, "The complaint mischaracterizes our work using selective quotes and cherry-picked documents."  So what do you think, do you think these lawsuits might help protect younger social media users? And what would your proposed solution be to make these platforms safe for all to use?  Our next story is about finding the light at the end of the tunnel, and I mean, literally. Forty-one workers were successfully rescued Tuesday after spending 17 days trapped inside a collapsed tunnel under the Himalayas. The workers were able to survive after a 173-foot pipe was inserted through the debris to provide them with food, water, and oxygen. It took weeks to drill an escape route through the mountain with rescue workers digging the last two meters by hand to reach the trapped people.  Eventually, though, the group emerged safely to the relief of families gathered around the tunnel exit. Officials say the workers appear to be in good health despite ordeal. What an impressive example of patients and resilience.  All right. Another big story this week on the artificial intelligence front. Remember yesterday, we mentioned that the word of the year for 2023 is "authentic." Well, one company is being accused of being not authentic. Sports Illustrated deleted several articles from its website after a report by futurism found were written under fake author names that used profile images generated by AI. Confused about how something like this could happen at this longtime magazine. Well, a spokesperson for the Arena Group, which operates Sports Illustrated claims the now deleted product reviews were created by a third-party company called AdVon Commerce. The spokesperson says they were assured that all the articles in question were written by humans using pseudonyms. Even so the group says it has ended their partnership with AdVon and are conducting an internal investigation into what happened. AdVon has not responded to CNN's request for comment.  Now pop quiz, hot shot. Ten second trivia.  What animal has the U.S. Centers for Disease and Control Prevention dubbed the world's deadliest? Poison dart frog, Komodo dragon, Black widow spider, or mosquitoes? Mosquitoes are the world's deadliest animal because they spread diseases like Malaria and West Nile virus causing hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide each year.  Call to Earth Day 2023 is focusing on how our actions, particularly in cities can affect wild and remote regions. Today, we had to Hawaii where the race is on to save a native forest bird from a formidable foe that has decimated their population.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAIN ASHER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR:  High up on a plateau in the middle of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, a team of researchers carefully transport, some extremely precious cargo. (OFF MIC) ASHER:  They've spent three days in this remote and rain-soaked expanse of jungle, looking for something very specific and very small. The egg of one of the world's most critically endangered species, a Hawaiian honeycreeper known as the 'Akikiki, found nowhere else on earth but here.  JUSTIN HITE, FIELD SUPERVISOR, KAUA'I FOREST BIRD RECOVERY PROJECT:  You're going to be just trying to collect them and bring them in to a captive block. Just because the assumption is that all of these birds are about to go extinct. ASHER:  According to the Hawaiian Department of Land and Natural Resources, there are only five of the species left in the wild.  HANNAH BAILEY, WILDLIFE CARE MANAGER, KEAUHOU BIRD CONSERVATION CENTER, SAN DIEGO ZOO WILDLIFE ALLIANCE:  The current state of 'Akikiki is pretty bad right now. We do have about 50 'Akikiki in human care at our two centers in Hawaii. And we do know that this past breeding season, there were no surviving chicks in the wild. ASHER:  Hannah Bailey manages the Keauhou Bird Conservation Center on the island of Hawaii. The center serves as a Noah's Ark of sorts for the 'Akikiki. BAILEY:  Our mission is to provide safe haven populations of the species that are in peril so that when the environment is right for them to survive long-term, we'll be able to re-release them. ASHER:  Hannah says the current state of all of Hawaii's forest birds is dire due in part to the usual culprits like habitat loss, but a newer and more deadly manners has emerged. BAILEY:  The biggest threat right now to Hawaii's endangered birds is mosquitoes. Because they carry avian malaria, which the birds have no resistance to. ASHER:  According to the American Bird Conservancy, climate change has enabled non-native mosquitoes to find their way to Kauai's highest elevations. The 'Akikiki's last refuge in the wild. BAILEY:  This is a portable brooder box that we can also use to incubate eggs. And it helps us transfer eggs from one location to another that have been incubated safely so that they will continue to grow and develop. ASHER:  We need to have landscape level solutions to the mosquito problems.  BAILEY:  And in doing this, the state and many other partners have worked with people that have studied malaria around the world. And so they're researching different solutions in malaria control, specifically ones that impact the mosquitoes without impacting the remainder of the environment. ASHER:  In the meantime, keeping the birds in centers like this one where enclosures are designed to mimic their natural habitat, but to protect it from mosquitoes, and where human interaction is strictly limited to discourage imprinting, a process where animals lose their natural behavior. These may very well be an entire species last chance at survival. BAILEY:  So KBCC along with San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance has been working really hard, especially this last spring in saving the remaining 'Akikiki in the wild. So our next step for these populations is continuing to grow the populations so that they have strong genetic diversity and a strong population to go back to their native habitat. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 NBA superstar, LeBron James becoming the NBA's all-time leader in minutes played surpassing the 66,300-  minute mark set by the legendary Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  You'd think that playing all those minutes at that level would be innovating. But LeBron who turns 39 next month playing in his 21st NBA season is still going strong. So what's the secret. LeBron has said that one thing is sleep. He gets at least eight hours each night, sometimes 10. And if he doesn't he'll nap for a couple of hours. So naps are good. Just try not to nap in class.  All right, superstars, big congrats to James at Digital Media Arts and Communications at Monroe One in Fairport, New York who submitted today's #YourWordWednesday winner, enervate, a verb meaning to cause someone to feel drained of energy or vitality or weaken.
