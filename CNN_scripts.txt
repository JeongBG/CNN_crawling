COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Bad news it's only Thursday. Good news it's Friday eve and we're going to slay today. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and we have a powerful show for you today. And we start with the ongoing and devastating situation occurring in Nigeria in West Africa. A month ago, the country experienced its worst flooding in a decade. Hundreds were killed as homes and businesses were submerged. Weeks later, the death toll has risen and communities remain underwater, displacing more than one million people from their homes.  Victims of the flood blame the tragedy on the government's response or lack thereof. Government officials say they released flood warnings ahead of the disaster and advised residents to move to safer ground. There is a question as to whether those warnings even reach some communities and experts say proper relief has not reached many Nigerians. Food is scarce in the country and difficult for many to afford. Nigeria's economy is struggling. Inflation hit a 17-year high of over 20 percent in August. This has further strained people's spending power and capacity to relocate. People have lost everything and many survivors are living in terrible conditions in camps and shelters with little to no government assistance. CNN correspondent Larry Madowo has been reporting on this for us on the ground in Bayelsa, Nigeria, where he's seen firsthand the tragic events that people there are facing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Our communities still submerged nearly a month after the flooding began with no end in sight. Boats have become the only way to get around much of Bayelsa State in Southern Nigeria. The streets have turned to rivers, driving entire communities away from their homes.  We have really suffered, she says. Tell the government to help us. UGERE OBI, FLOOD VICTIM:  Again, tell them to come help us. MADOWO:  Everything you own is here under the water and this is your house? OBI:  Yes. Everything. MADOWO:  Some are living rough on the streets, washing with this water, cooking with it and bathing in it. Even people's homes and businesses and livelihoods are already submerged, it's still raining and there is more expected. The Nigerian government is warning this could go until November, so even more of this. This is Nigeria's worst flooding in a decade.  Aniso Handy has remained in this house through it all. ANISO HANDY, FLOOD VICTIM:  Nigerians are used to manage. If not, we would have all died. We have not seen this situation where people are not cared for. But Nigerians care for themselves. We are just like infants that have no father, no mother. MADOWO:  The feeling of abandonment runs deep here. The victims are disappointed with the Nigerian government's response which hasn't declared the flood a national emergency. The floods have affected 33 of Nigeria's 36 states partly due to well above average rainfall.  Bayelsa is among those cut off from the nation with major highways underwater. The situation has been exacerbated by poor drainage infrastructure and an overflowing dam in neighboring Cameroon.  But with a warmer climate causing more intense rainfall, authorities have also blamed it on climate change, angering some Nigerians. In this community though, there are more short-term consequences. It's a tough life to navigate for humans and animals alike, but life must go on.  Larry Madowo, CNN, Bayelsa State, Nigeria. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up today, a debate around driverless cars. Are they safe? Are they needed? Are they helpful?  Well, what do you think?  The technology continues to be tested in various cities around the U.S. and one company called Waymo just announced it's planning to launch robo taxis in one of America's most populated cities, Los Angeles. They've already been tested in Phoenix, Arizona, and San Francisco.  We're talking fully autonomous or self-controlled driverless rides relying on detailed maps and sensors to navigate their surroundings. Proponents say these electric vehicles would provide more eco-friendly modes of transportation, while opponents of safety concerns and say that technology is not quite ready to be taken mainstream. CNN transportation editor Michael Ballaban gives us a glimpse now at a recent experience he had with the full self-driving technology available in a Tesla. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL BALLABAN, CNN TRANSPORTATION EDITOR:  Oh, we've got a situation in front of us. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, no, we're going on the wrong side of the road. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Nope, nope, nope. It wanted to hit the truck.  This is a Tesla model 3. So we are turning on the full self-driving beta. Okay, the car is now officially technically sort of driving itself. Whoa, whoa, that was a really sharp turn the car just tried to make. Oh, we've got a situation in front of us. Whoa. Okay, what we just had in front of us was a UPS truck coming onto our lane. We had a guy in front of us with a cargo bike. To avoid hitting the guy on the bike, the car seemed to want to put us straight into a giant UPS truck. I would prefer not to hit a UPS truck today. So I took over. It does seem to need an interruption every couple of blocks or so. Sometimes if the car is hesitating a little bit I have to intervene. You also have to be ready to take over at any time. Now, this is challenging. Oh, no, we're going on the wrong side of the road. We're not trying to make this car screw up. We're not trying to have a laugh at Elon Musk's suspense. That's not the point. We're really just trying to see how it handles driving in the city.  So far, it's going okay. We're going down a pretty just straight normal road. There's not a lot of pedestrians here and when you're going down a straight road with not a lot of pedestrians, the car actually seems to be doing okay. We're doing right around the speed limit. You know, we're not hitting anything.  The car can see cones. The car can see trucks. The car can see even pedestrians on the other side of the street.  Seeing might not be totally the issue here, it's knowing what to do in challenging situations, stuff that experience teaches you. A lot of people have issues with this being called full self-driving. First and foremost, it's not fully self-driving, I have to sit here. If it was fully self-  driving as promised that would let you take a nap, while you're driving along.  You know, it does seem to be making all the drivers upset. It's the people behind us it's the people honking. Now I'm not saying of truly fully autonomous car will never happen but I think at this point we're still years away. SUBTITLE:  Tesla did not respond to CNN Business' request for comment. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  I like to think of myself as a fun guy, but I've got nothing on these guys. Did you know that mushrooms are the largest life forms on the planet? Yep, they expand and grow underground with interconnected fibers called mycelium, looking for food, often nutrients from soil and trees, alive or dead. In fact, the largest living organism on Earth right now is a single honey mushroom in the Malheur National Forest in Oregon. It's three and a half miles wide about 2,500 acres, and it's believed to be about 2,400 years old. Now, that's a humongous fungus and that's random. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  All right. Halloween is exactly two peace signs days away, and I am loving your costume suggestions that you've been sending me on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok. Lex Luthor, Mr. Clean, keep them coming. I'm @CoyWire there. And speaking of TikTok, 73-year-old sensation Barbara "Babs" Costello has given folks pumpkin to talk about. Carving tips like sprinkling cinnamon in there to treat your olfactory senses. Oh my gord. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBARA COSTELLO, TIKTOK SENSATION:  I'm going to remove all those nasty strings the easier way. SUBTITLE:  This 73-year-old TikTok sensation gave us some hacks on how to improve the spooky season.  In a new video, Barbara "Babs" Costello broke down the do's and don'ts of pumpkin carving.  COSTELLO:  Hi, everybody. It's Babs. Did your mom ever tell you the do's and don'ts of pumpkin carving? SUBTITLE:  1. Carve the pumpkin from your lap. COSTELLO:  Don't stand and carve your pumpkin. Sit. Just put them on your lap. SUBTITLE:  2. Carve from the bottom of your pumpkin. COSTELLO:  Now time to cut the bottom of your pumpkin, not the top.  SUBTITLE:  3. Use a hand mixer to clean out your pumpkin. COSTELLO:  Don't do this. Use your hand mixer instead. Get all those strings cleaned up. Your mixer did the hard work of loosening all those strings. SUBTITLE:  4. Use a red dry erase marker to design the face. COSTELLO:  When designing your pumpkin face, use a dry erasable red marker that you can get rid of the lines after you carve.  SUBTITLE:  5. Carve the design with a rubber mallet and a cookie cutter. COSTELLO:  If you don't want to struggle using a knife to carve your pumpkin, just use a soft-headed mallet and your cookie cutter, and just push it right through. Remove all your red lines. SUBTITLE:  6. Cover all surfaces with Vaseline to keep it fresh. COSTELLO:  Don't let all your work go to waste. Those kids want to enjoy these pumpkins. Take Vaseline and rub it on all the open cut surfaces. We'll keep your pumpkin moist won't dry out as quickly, and it should last about one to two weeks.  SUBTITLE:  7. And finally, sprinkle some cinnamon. COSTELLO:  And if you want a beautifully scented jack-o-lantern, try sprinkling some cinnamon right on the top and over the candle she goes and she smells delicious. Happy Halloween. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. You gorgeous creatures, today is National Civics Day, celebrating the importance of civic education as a foundation for a strong democracy.  And we want to give a strong shout out now, Walnut Cove, North Carolina, Southeastern Stokes Middle School. Rise up and have an awesome day.  It's almost Friday. See you tomorrow.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. It's your boy Coy, and it's Thursday. So, happy Friday eve to you. This is CNN 10. We have an awesome show for you today, so without further ado, let's do what we do. We start today with the latest news out of China. Foxconn, one of Apple's largest suppliers, is racing to control a COVID-19 outbreak at its campus in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou. Trending social media videos show anxious workers reportedly fleeing the lockdown facility earlier this week after experiencing food shortages and difficult living conditions, including mandatory isolation. The city, which has a population of more than 12 million people, identified dozens of COVID-19 cases last month and the Chinese government shows few signs of easing its COVID policies. These events highlight how China's strict zero COVID policy is hurting international business. We'll hear now from my colleague Selina Wang, the CNN international correspondent, reporting on the chaotic conditions at the Foxconn factory. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Chaos at Foxconn, one of Apple's largest suppliers. It's Zhengzhou factory, which is its largest iPhone assembly factory in central China, is trying to contain a COVID flare-up but workers are fleeing the COVID restrictions. Viral videos on social media show masses of workers carrying their luggage trekking long distances across highways. Workers in recent days have been flooding social media with complaints about subpar living conditions, the poor quality of food and the difficulty and getting enough food amid the intense COVID restrictions. The exodus is putting major strain on Foxconn at a critical period just before the holiday season. It's another reminder of how China's zero COVID policy is hurting international businesses. According to analyst estimates, the Zhengzhou factory accounts for as much as 85 percent of Apple's iPhone assembly capacity. According to Counterpoint Research, they estimate that this could jeopardize 10 to 30 percent of the iPhone-14 production if this situation doesn't stabilize in the near term. Now, according to state media, Foxconn is trying to boost capacity production at other sites. The company says it is actually quadrupling bonuses for workers at the Zhengzhou plant in order to incentivize workers to stay. But zero COVID is clearly still having a massive impact on businesses, on people's daily lives, the entire city of Zhengzhou, which is home to more than 12 million people, it's been under lockdown since late October. These constant lockdowns in China are causing global businesses to re- evaluate the reliability of China as a production base. In fact, Apple has been increasing production in places like India in order to reduce its dependency on China. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In Spanish, the word "manta" means what? Blanket, bread, balloon or basket. Manta refers to a type of cloak or blanket which is why manta rays share the name describing the look of the animal's large flat diamond-shaped bodies. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Today is CNN's Call to Earth Day, which aims to highlight the conservation work of organizations and individuals around the world and in connection with that. We have a special feature with marine scientists and Rolex Awards laureate Kerstin Forsberg who's working to protect manta rays in her home country of Peru. I recently had a chance to talk with her about her experience beneath the waves. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KERSTIN FORSBERG, MARINE BIOLOGIST AND CONSERVATIONIST:  The ocean is our source of life. The ocean touches us in every single second. It's, you know, connected with our atmosphere. The ocean provides resources. The ocean provides oxygen in our planet. The ocean provides so many different things to inspire us even on a cultural or emotional level. WIRE:  What made you fall in love with the ocean? Why did you choose this path? FORSBERG:  I was passionate about nature and environment and animals ever since I was a kid. I was always reading about animals, reading about nature. And then I think as I grew up and I decided to start a career in biology, it became really clear to me that the ocean was in real trouble, and that a lot of people needed to really start to think about the importance that the ocean has on our everyday lives. WIRE:  You have designed and developed dozens of environmental initiatives. What are some of the biggest challenges facing our oceans and ocean life right now? FORSBERG:  We're taking all the resources out of it. We're polluting the ocean. We're putting all our waste and dumping all their waste into it. So it's really about thinking of us as our everyday and how we connect to the ocean, and how we can depend on the ocean, but we can also shape the ocean. So, through sustainable seafood consumption, through making sure that we are utilizing our waste properly, and that's how we're going to ultimately stop those challenges which at the end are all about over-exposition, pollution and also climate change and habitat destruction. We started building a network of schools. It's called the Marine Educators Network of Northern Peru. And this network of schools started to grow, in over local schools in northern Peru, connecting between each other with teachers starting to incorporate ocean literacy within classrooms, but then building on that having youth start developing their own environmental projects that benefited their communities. First of all, we work with schools. We partner together with schools and with teachers and we develop an ocean literacy training program in which kids learn about the ocean, learn about how we're connected to the ocean. But even beyond that, they learn about environmental leadership and how to develop their own project. So we're giving them the tools on how to develop a project how to set out goals how to develop your own budget, how to track your progress and in doing that connect kids so we've developing feedback between each other and really developing this sense of global citizenship at the end, right? We all need to start connecting between our ourselves as global citizens in order to move forward and address sustainability challenges. WIRE:  Well, we have a special day, Call to Earth Day. I'm sure you have something up your sleeve or two. FORSBERG:  For Call to Earth Day, we will be hosting an activity in northern Peru, with over 40 different youth. These are local university students and we're partnering with a series of local organizations, including from the regional government and civil society and conservation areas. So, it's really about having everybody together. It's going to be a huge celebration, where different organizations come together, with different youth come together, and again, we're different disciplines, right? Come together, and ultimately, land and sea come together So, that's what it's all about for us, Call to Earth. It's a celebration of our planet that connects us all. WIRE:  Kerstin Forsberg, your -- your smile, your passion are contagious. You inspire us as we aspire to make this world a bit of a better place. Thank you so much for joining us. FORSBREG:  Thank you so much for the invitation. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, we may have bitten off more than we can choo choo. The world's longest ever passenger train took a trip through the Swiss Alps. What ingenuity, this train is 1.2 miles long, made up of a hundred cars, it had to be a slowcomotive, taking about an hour to complete a 15-mile trip, through 22 tunnels, over 48 bridges. The record-breaking event took place on October 29th, the 175th anniversary of Switzerland's first railway. For your news, for some fun, we're here for you train or shine. And so is shout-out time. Mrs. Bush's class at Bosqueville Middle School in Waco, Texas. Think it, speak it, believe it. Did you know that today, November 3rd is National Stress Awareness Day. So, like my four-year-old daughter tells me, smell the flowers, cool the soup. Whenever you feel overwhelmed, don't fret about the future. Don't worry about the past.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey you. You made it to Friday, and you already know Friday's rock. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. And we've got an awesome show for you today. Let's finish this week strong. I have some good news to start your weekend. Many of you get an extra hour of sleep on Sunday, Daylight Saving Time. But could this be the last year of it? Every year on the first Sunday of November at 2:00 a.m., many of us turn our clocks back an hour. On the second Sunday in March, they spring back forward an hour. But where did this idea of shifting time come from and why is it so polarizing? Let's take 10 to break it all down. While Benjamin Franklin gets credit for the first mention of the idea, Daylight Saving Time was first implemented in the U.S. with the Standard Time Act of 1918. A wartime measure with the purpose of adding more daylight hours to conserve energy resources Currently, not all states participate in daylight saving, including most of Arizona and Hawaii. Over 70 countries around the world use daylight saving time with notable exceptions of China and Japan. But earlier this year, the U.S. Senate passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act which would make Daylight Saving Time permanent year round, beginning in the fall of 2023. That bill is currently sitting in the House of Representatives. If passed there and then signed by the president, it would mean no more changing clocks in the U.S. There are, of course, arguments for and against the practice. We'll travel to the United Kingdom now to meet a small group of clockmakers who have a big job of making sure everything is working on time, especially when it comes to the time change. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX JEFFREY, CLOCKMAKER, PALACE OF WESTMINSTER:  I love talking about clocks. I could talk about clocks all day. Not everyone wants to hear about them, but everyone wants to hear about the clocks at the Palace of Westminster. Whether it's Big Ben, whether it's just being interested in such a busy building, working on clocks, doing the time change, maintaining, it's something I take a lot of pride in. REPORTER:  Ian Westworth and Alex Jeffrey are part of a small team of clockmakers at the Palace of Westminster in London. Twice a year, when the clocks spring forward or fall back across the United Kingdom, they have the responsibility of adjusting 2,000 timepieces before lawmakers return to work. JEFFREY:  There's two thousand clocks on the parliamentary estate. There's 500 heritage clocks, there's two days and it's our task to perform the GMT time change. IAN WESTWORTH, CLOCMAKER, PALACE OF WESTMINISTER:  And overnight, we changed Big Ben. The great clock of Westminster and we put that back an hour just to make sure everybody who can now see the dials can actually tell at the right time when they wake up on Sunday morning. JEFFREY:  So, this is one of our heritage clocks. There's around four or five hundred of them, and they're just going to bring the minute hand back to do the time change being careful not to graze the dial, and it's -- in one of the committee rooms along committee corridor where a lot of important meetings happen. WESTWORTH:  We have clocks here that pre-date this palace and some that were designed specifically for this palace. We do actually come across clocks that we've never found before. It only happened the other week. An MP contacted us saying, I've got a clock in my office, it hasn't run for some time. And I'm thinking, I've been here 18 years and I've never been into your office. He said that's probably why it hasn't worked. JEFFREY:  The time changes were put in initially as a mechanism, a practical mechanism to take advantage of daylight hours in the summer. So, it's important I think to keep that tradition. REPORTER:  In the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill championed the concept of daylight saving during the First World War before he became prime minister, believing that the country could save energy by stretching the hours of evening sunlight. The practice has spread across the world. In the U.S. most states observe daylight saving moving clocks forward in the spring. Only Hawaii and most of Arizona don't. In 2022, the Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act, a law which would make Daylight Saving Time permanent across the United States from November 5th, 2023. If passed by the House, the clocks would not fall back again. In the U.K., a 2019 poll showed that a small majority of Britons want to keep changing the clocks. At the Palace of Westminster, its resident clockmakers are responsible for maintaining this tradition. WESTWORTH:  Even with this digital world, you know, everybody's got a computer with a clock at the bottom or they've got a digital watch on. But the MPS and the lords or the staff, who've actually got a ticking clock in their office. One of the first things they look at is the ticking clock and not the one on the wrist. Our job is to make sure that every day, these clocks are working for them. The last clock of the day before doing great clock tonight. JEFFREY:  You know, there's a lot of ground to cover. I left my step count on last year and it was 55,000 steps. It's very time consuming but it's very rewarding. You know, we can say to each other, well done, guys. It's a job well done and when people turn up for work on Monday, they're right on time. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And now it's time for some hero talk. We've been introducing you to CNN Heroes since the start of the school year. Together, we met a woman upcycling old computers to open new worlds for young people in our home country of Kenya. We met a teacher in New Jersey on a mission to hand out free books by the thousands. This week, CNN announced the top heroes of the year. Let's meet them and hear how they are making this world a better place. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  From California when elderly dog owners can no longer care for their pets, Carie Broecker helps them stay together or finds these beloved family members new forever homes. From Nashville, Richard Casper uses art to heal the wounds of war. He's helping fellow veterans share their stories visually and vocally. Nelly Cheboi is bringing technology to young people in her native Kenya, recycling old computers, she provides the tools and education for brighter futures. North Carolina innovator Nora El-Khouri Spencer is training women for well- paying careers in construction while also helping seniors age safely at home. From south Philadelphia after spending five years in prison on drug charges, Tyrique Glasgow is now providing his neighborhood long challenged by poverty and gun violence with safety and opportunity. Alaskan nurse Teresa Gray leads volunteer medics into global hot spots, delivering vital care and support to those in need. Meymuna Hussein-Cattan is helping refugees and immigrants transition to lives in the U.S. with critical resources and support while also sharing their culture with the L.A. community. Aidan Reilly brought together a nationwide network of young volunteers tackle food waste and insecurity they're rescuing tons of excess produce from farms to feed the hungry. From Chicago, Deborah Vines struggled to find support and resources when her son Jason was diagnosed with autism. Now, she's providing services and education to African American families and first responders. And Atlanta's Bobby Wilson is feeding and healing his urban community by teaching thousands of people how to plant grow and prepare their own healthy food. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: American, Bridal Veil, and Horseshoe are features that combine to make what natural wonder? Great Barrier Reef, Niagara Falls, Grand Canyon, or Galapagos Islands. Located on the U.S. Canadian border, these are the names of the three waterfalls that together make Niagara Falls. (END VIDEO CLIP) WEIR:  We're giving this next story an A-plus, a gold star, and a 10 out of 10. Niagara Falls, one of the natural wonders of the world, on the New York and Canadian border, draws visitors from every corner of the planet who come to see its majestic cascading water. Well, there's a tunnel buried deep beneath the falls. It's been off limits until now. It's about seven football fields long it was built more than a century ago on the Canadian side as part of the former Niagara Parks Power Station. And visitors can now venture through the plant down the corridor and onto a waterside platform for some of the most breathtaking views in the world. This has been an awesome week.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  It is Monday and it's going to be the best day because it's the next day. I'm Coy, here with your news, some inspiration and a little bit of fun. Thanks for choosing us to help you start your week strong. We begin today with news on the Mississippi River. This video shows the river at historically low levels from Illinois to Louisiana. Experts say the record low water levels are due to the worst drought in the central part of the United States in at least a decade and that we can expect to see continued decreasing levels in the months to come. Lack of rain or snow over a period of time and atmospheric conditions such as temperature change and changes in the jet stream are all factors that can contribute to drought and low water levels. According to the U.S. drought monitor, half of the United States is covered by moderate drought conditions or worse, with more than 134 million people affected. That's the highest part of the population since 2016. And the Midwest has seen the worst of it. Several inches of rain are possible over the next week near the Mississippi River which could provide some relief but the drought is forecast to continue through January and low water levels have some serious consequences. They could impact crops at a crucial time for harvest and allow for salt water from the Gulf of Mexico to travel up the Mississippi River which could potentially spoil Louisiana drinking water with salt.  And while the Army Corps of Engineers has been dredging or excavating portions of the river's basin to make a path for boat traffic to keep flowing. It's at such a slow pace, hundreds of barges and vessels carrying goods are waiting for the all-clear to be able to pass through the shallow river. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  To navigate this river in the old South, a man would stand on the prowess steam ship and bounce a lead weight on a knotted string off the bottom. If it was a safe 12 feet deep, he'd shout "Mark Twain". Samuel Clemens made that his pen name, of course.  But if he wrote about this river today, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn would spend a lot of time walking on the beach because in too many places, the not so mighty Mississippi is a fraction of a Twain. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're going to look at a few old steamboats, steamboat racks. WEIR:  Mark Twain era steamboats? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah. WEIR:  And the relentless drought across the heartland is exposing all kinds of memories. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It may have caught on fire or sank 50 miles upstream and floated here during floods. WEIR:  As far as water levels go, this is as worse if you've ever seen? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is about as low as I've seen it. WEIR:  From the Missouri down to New Orleans, accidental archaeologists are finding steamboat graveyards and human remains, Civil War ammo and forgotten shipwrecks. And one of the more striking yardsticks is here in Baton Rouge. This is the USS Kidd, a World War II destroyer, and on a good year the Mississippi comes to that first rush strike, about 25 feet above my head right now. And these water levels are so low creating such a catastrophic shipping crisis that this is going to affect your grocery bill, is the price of moving. A bushel of soybeans went up 300 percent and there are thousands of barges full of food and all they can do is just wait and pray for rain. And if they can't get rain, they pray for help. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We've got a difficult stretch of river. WEIR:  From the Army Corps of Engineers, with billions of dollars on the line, they cut channels as fast as they can with working antiques like the Dredge Potter. Built in 1932 but still a workhorse and an endless fight with the river in every kind of weather. You're a professional riverbed redecorator. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kind of, yeah, yeah.  WEIR:  A little of this over here. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's right. WEIR:  Over there. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As long as we can keep barges moving and keep commodities prices down, we're all in good shape. WEIR:  That's your -- that's your mission. It's impressive to see up front. Andy, you know the Ole Miss better than most, huh? You've been doing this a while. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thirty-four years. (LAUGHTER) WEIR:  And how would you characterize what's going on these days? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is a concern, a heightened concern. I don't know that I -- we call it a panic yet, but we are watching the water levels very closely, on an almost an hourly basis.  WEIR:  Is it the kind of thing where if this goes on you can dredge around the problem? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  To a point. In 1989 and then again in 2012, we got to an area where the chan -- to a level where the channel was almost unsustainable. So we had numerous dredges working and there was very little commerce going through. And ultimately, what saved the day was rain. WEIR:  And these days, when you wish for rain, you have to specify not all at once. The Midwest is still recovering from summer flash floods. And if the water cycle whiplashes again, hard rain on parched earth would be another blow to farmers, already struggling to move their harvest.  Fewer and lighter barges on the river means more expensive trains and trucks putting more planet cooking pollution into Earth's system. And on a connected planet where one in eight humans eat something that was moved down the Mississippi, those hearty souls on the Dredge Potter are going to need a lot more help.

But everything from fuel leaks to hurricanes have already stalled the mission. Liftoff is now scheduled for November 14th and Artemis is back on the launch pad waiting for its big moment. But if you can't wait, there may be a way for you to get that moonwalking feeling right here on Earth. A new invention from Shift Robotics aims to make walking faster and more efficient. But will they revolutionize the way we walk? That remains to be seen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) XUNJIE ZHANG, CEO, SHIFT ROBOTICS:  Instead of replacing walking, what if we can augmenting or enhancing walking? REPORTER:  These are not roller skates, they are moonwalkers designed by Shift Robotics, a startup out of the robotics lab at Carnegie Mellon University. ZHANG:  I think the biggest problem is just the walking is too slow, it's super inefficient to get around by walking. So instead of replacing walking, what if we can you know augmenting or enhancing walking? REPORTER:  The company says these battery powered shoes can boost walking speeds up to seven miles an hour. Using a machine learning algorithm, Shift Robotics says the shoes can adapt to a user's walking pattern in real time. ZHANG:  You know, even though it has some elements of roller skate. You never freeloading, you just go -- they only move when you want to move. REPORTER:  Moonwalkers can fit most shoes with flexible straps that can be easily taken on and off with magnetic buckles. With speed limitation tech and braking systems the company claims the shoes are safe to use on on sidewalks or in crowded areas. ZHANG:  Outside the personal commuting or running errand scenes we think they're going to be great on distribution centers supermarket stores like warehouses for example where it's not fully automated but that still require lots of people walking around. REPORTER:  Shift Robotics also claims that users can walk over six miles after a single charge of an hour and a half. The company says it will deliver the first batch of shoes to consumers in March 2023 at nearly fourteen hundred dollars.  ZHANG:  I think at one day, you know, once we achieve economy scales, we will be able to drop the price we will be able to develop newer models that will allow us ultimately to drive the cost down.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is a hoot, a textbook example of parody by a parrot. TV reporter Nicholas Crum was in Chile telling a story about rising crime rates when a parrot pulls off an impeccable heist stealing the headphone right out of his ear. He gone. Crum, he needs to be more careful. He had someone else chase the thief for him so he could continue his report. Apparently, Crum suspected foul play. Well, the whole thing was caught on camera and where it is, he did get his headphone back. All right. Without feather ado, my favorite parrot of the day, I want to give a special shout out to West Side Middle School in Charleston, West Virginia.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, hello. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy. Grateful to be spending part of my day right here with you on CNN 10. Today is the first Tuesday in November and that means election day across America. Millions of Americans head to the polls to cast their ballots but they won't be choosing the next U.S. president. Americans will cast their votes for representatives in Congress and candidates for state and local offices.  Every two years, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for election while only about a third of the 100-seat Senate are up for grabs. These are called midterm elections because they happen two years into a U.S. president's four-year term. The midterms are the first chance for voters to weigh in on President Biden's term, policies and vision for America. All eyes are on Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania, four states that President Biden flipped to Democrat in the election but are now battlegrounds states that Republicans could win back. Issues at the top of mind for voters are, the economy, social issues, immigration, concerns about violent crime and concerns about election security and the election process itself.  This year, early voting has surged in some key states, including Georgia, which shattered records for early voter turnout but rain forecasted across the country today could impact voter turnout on election day. We'll hear more now from CNN's Karin Caifa about today's elections and what Americans might expect as results come in. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARIN CAIFA, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  President Joe Biden isn't on the ballot, but for most Americans, it's their first chance to weigh in on his party and policies. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This election isn't a referendum, it's a choice. It's a choice between two fundamentally different visions of America. CAIFA:  Among states taking center stage in the battle for the U.S. Senate tight races in four that president Biden flipped in the 2020 presidential election, Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania were Biden and former President Barack Obama stumped Saturday. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT:  Democracy itself is on the ballot. The stakes are high.  CAIFA:  And former President Donald Trump also rallied. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT:  This election is your chance to make your voice heard. CAIFA:  Underscoring how 2022 may foreshadow the 2024 presidential contest. Polls indicate most voters are looking at the economy right now as they cast ballots. Democrats touted Friday's October jobs report and unemployment still near a half century low as assigned their economic policies are working, while Republicans point to the highest inflation in 40 years.  SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI):  The inflation crushing our pocketbooks, can't fill up our tank, can't fill up our grocery cart. CAIFA:  Democrats hope the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June will motivate voters, especially women, while Republicans have accused Democrats of being weak on crime especially in major cities.  Both parties eager to drive turnout in their favor. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Name the peninsula in Egypt located between the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea. Sinai, Iberian, Arabian or Yucatan? Sinai peninsula is the answer here and at the southern tip is where you'll find the Egyptian city of Sharm El-sheikh. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  This week and next in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, tens of thousands of world leaders, representatives, negotiators, businesses and citizens will gather for the COP27 Conference. Twenty-seven because this is the 27th year that the global climate summit has been held. The focus of these conferences is climate change. The U.N. says this was a fringe issue when the summits began, but it's now a global priority though different nations have different levels of commitment to it. Carbon dioxide emissions are front and center here. Most scientists say these emissions are harming the global environment by causing earth's average temperatures to rise a smaller group of scientists says that climate change happens naturally and that the earth can absorb human carbon emissions. But the goal of these U.N. summits is for member countries to lay out new plans to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide. Let's take a look now at the history of these COP conferences as nations continue to debate the issues that relate to the health of the planet. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  COP stands for Conference of the Parties. The gatherings are intense technical negotiations brokered by the U.N. Countries are meant to work together to coordinate a global effort to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. But progress at successive COP summits has been limited. RAUL ESTRADA-OYUELA, KYOTO COP3 CHAIRMAN:  This is a very long process. It will take decades. PAULA DOBRIANSKY, HEAD OF U.S. DELEGATION, BALI, COP13:  We will go forward and join consensus in this today. LEONARDO DICAPRIO, UN MESSENGER OF PEACE: Now must be our moment for action. REPORTER:  The first climate COP summit took place in Berlin in 1995, and representatives from more than states or territories attended. Two years later, progress. The parties at COP3 in Japan agreed to the Kyoto Protocol in which 37 industrialized states or territories were legally bound to start reducing their emissions.  But the biggest polluter at the time the United States refused to ratify the agreement because it didn't oblige developing nations like China to cut emissions. In the following years, climate change slipped on and off the global agenda. After 9/11, the world's attention shifted to fighting international terrorism. Climate issues took a back seat. All the while, greenhouse gas emissions continue to soar and without the United States and China on board, the Kyoto protocol began to crumble, successive climate summits produced few results. COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009 was highly anticipated, but fell short.  BUYELWA SONJICA, SOUTH AFRICAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTER:  It's not acceptable. It's definitely not acceptable. It's disappointing. REPORTER:  Then at COP21 in Paris, there was a breakthrough. In 2015, the Paris agreement was adopted by more than 190 parties, including the U.S. and China, and effectively replaced Kyoto. Its ambition was to limit global warming to well below two, but preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But the watchdog Climate Action Tracker shows that all major economies are off track to meeting their obligations to contain temperature rise and as governments lagged in fulfilling their pledges a new wave of youth-led environmental activism was born. GRETA THUNBERG, CLIMATE ACTIVIST:  All what you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you? DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, before Paris, France. REPORTER:  Then, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris agreement, only for his successor President Biden to bring the U.S. back into it.  JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  This moment demands urgency. Good ideas and good intentions aren't good enough. REPORTER:  At COP26 in Glasgow, developed countries pledged $100 billion annually to support developing countries in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting their economies.  But the conference also had its shortcomings. India successfully demanded that the final agreement would commit countries to phase down rather than phase out coal. JOURNALIST:  It's according to science, sir. It's according to science. BHUPENDER YADAV, INDIAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTER:  No, not at all. REPORTER:  Fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas emit heat trapping greenhouse gas emissions. And if we don't cut those emissions dramatically, scientists predict global temperatures could warm by three degrees by the end of the century. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Now for today's 10 out of 10, we're bringing you a tasty story that's going to wake you up. People deep-fry chicken, they deep-fry potatoes. I've even heard of deep fried Oreos.  But coffee? How to even do that? James Hoffman, a coffee connoisseur and author, deep fried the coffee beans for 14-1/2 minutes. And he says it created a soft and buttery cup of Joe rich but not greasy, I guess you could deep fry just about anything. I think my weakness is French fries. I can eat them all day, every day. What's your weakness? Like if you were a superhero, what would your kryptonite be? Let me know at Coy Wire on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok. Shout out time now.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Wonderful Wednesday to you. I know we're just halfway through the week, but we're going to keep on grinding and shining because that's just what we do. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10 and we've got a rendezvous with the news. Yesterday was election day in America. Millions of adults all across the country went to the polls to cast their votes for representatives in Congress, senators and state and local officials. The results were still coming in when we produced this show for the latest info check out CNN.com where results are updated in real time. But between early voting which shattered state records in Georgia and absentee ballots and the sheer volume of votes on election day it could be a while before we know who the winners are all eyes are on the results in Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania, battleground states that Biden flipped to Democratic states in the 2020 presidential election. But now, Republicans are hoping to gain control there. Experts say the 2022 midterm results could foreshadow the 2024 presidential contest. Polls indicate that most voters rank the economy as the number one issue on their minds, but women's rights, guns and public safety as well as immigration and election security are also major issues that are important to voters in this election. Let's hear now from chief national correspondent John King in the election center who explains the early signs he's looking for as election results come in. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Let's start in the House. JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Four hundred thirty-five races in all, under new lines because of the census two years ago, the redistricting process. As you know better than anybody, they're not all competitive. So, what we've done is we've identified working with our partners at inside elections, 82 competitive seats heading into election day. And as you can see, they are coast to coast. Another way to look at it, look at this, just to understand Democrats are on defense. It's a Democratic president's first midterm. It's a tough climate, just look down here at the key to these seats. BASH:  Yeah. KING:  Fifty-seven of the competitive seats have Democratic incumbents almost three times as many, almost three times as many of Republicans. There are three new seats here too as you look at the map. So Democrats are on their heels defending much more territory in a tough year. That's one way to look at it. Now let's bring it up, the big question is, who can get to 2018, right? And in our rankings right now, we already have Republicans favored in seats. Now some of those are just barely favored you see the lighter red on the map. But Republicans have a huge advantage going into election day and if you look down and, you know, the race is very well. These toss-up races go coast to coast. BASH:  Let's look at the Senate. Obviously right now, 50-50. KING:  Right. BASH:  It could go so many different ways. KING:  The chess game here, you can game it out. Reasonably, Democrats winning here, Republicans winning there were elections in all. Again, you work with -- we've worked with our partners here to identify the competitive seats. Eight elections of the Senate, we view as competitive. It could be more. Republicans think they could surprise us in some places of these eight. They're evenly divided now between held by Democrats or held by Republicans. Best way to look at this is to come into the balance of power as you come into the control right now. Again, Democrats enter the election, 50-50. The vice president United States breaks the ties. So Democrats can't afford to lose essentially. And so, you have the states on the map if you come in now to how we rank them, the goal or the toss-up states, one is a Republican held state right now, no incumbent Pennsylvania, Democratic incumbent in Georgia, the probably the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent you were just out there in Nevada. BASH:  Yeah. KING:  This is where the chess gets fascinating. BASH:  Yeah. And so many -- I mean, you're saying that these yellow are maybe the tightest, but that might belie what we're actually seeing on the ground, which is a wider swath of really, really tight races. KING:  But it is possible, again, we know these races are competitive right. But we still tilt New Hampshire Democratic, Republicans think they can pick up that seat. We still tilt Arizona Democratic; Republicans think that one is within their reach. They say watch, we still have -- this as likely Dem up in Washington state, in Colorado, Republicans say keep an eye on everything. So you could -- you conceivably could get Republicans to 52 or 53. You can also get the Democrats to 51 or stay status quo at 50. Again, this race could decide the Senate. In the end, does anybody get above or are we going are we going another month? BASH:  Or are we going to be standing here in December? KING:  On December 6th, but you were just out here. This is what Democrats worry about most. They view Catherine Cortez Masto as the most vulnerable Democrat and again think about the math, right? We won't know that one because it's out west, right? The Democrats would love to pick up Pennsylvania as a safety valve an insurance policy against maybe losing out in Nevada. BASH:  It is going to be a long and very exciting night. KING:  Week. BASH:  Maybe week. John King, thank you. KING:  Thank you. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In what sport would you find a gully, sweeper and a wicket keeper? Curling, bowling, cricket or lacrosse? The answer here is cricket in which the only field are allowed to wear gloves is called the wicket keeper. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Our next story involves the sport of cricket but it's about so much more than the intricacies of the game. It showcases a much broader dynamic of sports and highlights the importance of camaraderie, lifting each other up and setting aside differences to work together towards something greater than ourselves. Steffan Nero is visually impaired. He struggled to fit in, but his life changed when he found his squad, and he's gone on to shatter records. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUBTITLE:  Steffan Nero is not your average athlete. Born with two visual impairments, he struggled at school, failing to find a place where he felt he fitted in. After discovering visually impaired sports, Australian Nero started playing blind cricket and found new horizons. STEFFAN NERO, BLIND CRICKETER:  Sport is for me is such a big part of my life. like I can't really understate it, to be honest. I never really connected with other people my age regarding, you know, just obviously other people who didn't have the same obviously sight condition as me. But I usually felt quite lonely at high in high school. Sport, I would say, really changed my life and really pushed me to realize that I do have a lot of potential. I'd say I've flourished in a way. I became much more confident in myself. Part of a family, you're part of a group, you all dealt with the same experiences. You can speak to each other, and that's something that I really needed when I was growing up, because I think without it I've been a much more -- much different situation without those kinds of experiences. SUBTITLE:  Blind cricket differs from the able-bodied version in a number of ways. Players of varying visual impairments bowl a ball with internal bearings underhanded, allowing it to be heard. Nero etched his name into sporting history when he scored a record-breaking 309 not out innings against New Zealand. NERO:  Once I got the 300-mark, I was just like, okay, this is, you know, I can even make history here. When everyone was clapping as well, it was amazing feeling to experience and something I could say I'll never forget for the rest of my life. Obviously, it wasn't just me, but it was the team and my coaching staff, everyone, my parents, everyone. But still my name was said, Steffan Nero has made 309. So still a very special moment. SUBTITLE:  Although the response was overwhelmingly positive, there were still some negative comments around the record. NERO:  Majority of people obviously very crisp of saying, oh, wow, didn't realize this game that I think it can -- it helps to kind of change people's minds a bit about what disability means as well. I did hear a few comments saying oh you know it's just disability cricket. You know that kind of thing. But like I said a lot of people just making jokes about it as well, which happens, you know, that's the way it is on social media. After a while, I stopped looking at the comments and stuff as well and just kind of just ignored it and said, you know what, this is something that I think is really positive for blind cricket, for people with disabilities in Australia as well. SUBTITLE:  As well as furthering the sport, Nero wants to use his position to inspire the next generation. NERO:  I always say, if you try something, you don't like it, then that's fine. Unless you've tried it, you know, you're taking that first step. It probably will be the hardest thing you ever do, but once it happens and you're involved in that kind of group and that community, I think things get much easier and can be quite a really rewarding experience. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10 story might cause an uproar, and I ain't even lying. The Oklahoma City zoo needs names for its litter of African lion cubs, and it's asking the public to pick 'em. Born September 26 at the zoo's lion overlook habitat, these cute baby lions are the zoo's first in 15 years. Before the cubs are old enough to be put in public display though, they need names. But before you toss out names like Santa Claws (ph), Empe-roar (ph), or Kitty Purrie (ph), you have to cast your vote on a pre-approved name on a list on the zoo's website. Shout out time now. High five and a high 10 to Maclay Middle School in Tallahassee, Florida. Hope you all have a happy day. And remember, happiness isn't some idea that we have to chase or find or create. Happiness is right here, right now, whenever we choose to embrace it. Much love and many blessings. I'm Coy and this is CNN 10. END221110

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. I'm Coy Wire. Here to help you jump-start your week with the best minutes in news right here on CNN 10.  let's start today with an update on the midterm elections. Last week, millions of adults across the country went to the polls to cast their votes for representatives in Congress senators and state and local officials Democrats performed better than predicted. They are projected to retain majority control of the U.S. Senate after winning a pivotal race in Nevada.  Now Democrats will hold 50 Senate seats with Republicans currently holding 49. A December runoff election in the state of Georgia could earn Republicans a matching 50th Senate seat but Democrats would still hold a tie-breaking vote in the Senate which belongs to Vice President Kamala Harris. But the race isn't over yet Republicans may win the House of Representatives as votes continue to be tallied from a handful of districts. If Republicans win the House, they could still stop a significant portion of President Biden's Democratic agenda in his medical proposals. Congress makes nationwide laws. The House decides which laws are voted on, while the Senate can approve or block them and confirm appointments made by the president. Let's hear now from CNN's Jessica Schneider, a justice correspondent based in Washington. She has an update on President Biden's proposal to forgive some student loan debt which would need clear congressional authorization to go through. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  A federal judge out of Texas who is actually nominated by President Trump is now saying President Biden just does not have the power to forgive these student loans by executive order and instead, President Biden would need clear congressional authorization to forgive these loans and he would have had to go through more of a process rather than just simply issuing an executive order.  However, we will see an appeal of this decision. The Justice Department has already noticed that it will appeal and this is ultimately a decision that could be determined by the Supreme Court. Of course, President Biden issued this executive order in August. It's estimated that if it goes through, it would ultimately cost about $400 billion.  The program though now in doubt, and it's also been on hold for the past month because of another court decision out of a circuit court that put the loan forgiveness rollout on hold while all these legal challenges play out.  You know, we know that about 26 million borrowers already have applied for this debt relief. The government had already approved million of those applications, but no debt at all will be canceled for the foreseeable future here because of these court challenges. The White House press secretary did however say that the Department of Education will hold on to the information of all of these applicants so it could be processed pretty quickly if the program is ultimately given the green light in court. But we'll have to see how the courts decide this. If it does go all the way to the Supreme Court, it's possible that the conservative majority on the Supreme Court could nix this program as well. You know this has been a majority that's often skeptical of wide-ranging executive and agency action, so this debt forgiveness program could ultimately. Be deemed unconstitutional and if that happens none of these millions of people would get any debt relief. But for now this program is also on hold. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, a film crew searching the Atlantic Ocean for World War II artifacts unexpectedly swam upon something much more modern, a 20-foot long piece of the Space Shuttle Challenger which exploded shortly after liftoff in 1986. CNN's space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT:  It was the space shuttle's very distinctive heat shield tiles that really gave these divers their first clue that perhaps they had found a piece of NASA's old space shuttle Challenger and you can see in the video these white square tiles that are you know partially covered by sand now in the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean and those white tiles would have been used to protect the underbelly of the space shuttle from the very high temperatures that it would encounter as it re-entered the earth's atmosphere.  So the lead team member on this expedition, the guy by the name of Mike Barnett, he had a friend who was a former NASA astronaut. He showed him this video and that made them convinced that this is indeed what they had found. They brought it to NASA and NASA confirmed it, announcing the findings just this week. And so, the big question now is what does NASA do with this? By law, any piece of a space shuttle is NASA property. So NASA is trying to find a way to do something with this 20-feet section to do something that would really honor the memory of these seven astronauts that were killed back in January of 1986, including Christa McAuliffe who of course would have been the very first teacher in space. Kristin Fisher, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which U.S. government agency measures job market activity and working conditions? Department of Commerce, Department of State, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics? The Bureau of Labor Statistics serves as the statistical resource for the U.S. Department of Labor. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  For the past year, the job market has been strong. In October, the economy created 261,000 new jobs. But things may not quite be what they seem. Job hires dropped to a low not seen in more than a year and a half.  We'll hear now from CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich who's finding out why getting a job might not be as easy as some might think, and how some people are getting creative to get noticed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARLY PAVLINAC, JOB SEEKER:  I'm open to all options. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Karly Pavlinac is on stage in a high-stakes competition. The potential prize: a new job. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How do you make sure you're working with the right talent, you're finding the right connections? PAVLINAC:  The biggest thing is just being able to communicate the idea. YURKEVICH:  This is not the first time Pavlinac has done something unconventional to land an interview, since losing her marketing job in September. After she didn't hear back for a position at Nike, she sent them a cake with her resume on it.  PAVLINAC:  I've been applying obviously that hasn't worked yet, so let me throw something new in the mix and see if that you know works. YURKEVICH:  Her resume cake making headlines.  PAVLINAC:  I've since talked to a bunch of people at Nike but still no job. YURKEVICH:  But the economic data tells a different story. The jobs market is strong. There are 10.7 million open positions, labor shortages and hundreds of thousands of jobs being added each month.  Yet some job seekers even with a viral cake moment can't seem to land one. LIZ ANN SONDERS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST:  On the surface, this is still fairly strong labor market. But if you go a couple of layers under, you are starting to see more significant cracks in the surface that suggest we should eventually see it in those more popular headline type labor market readings. YURKEVICH:  Cracks like a slowdown in hiring, as seen in this week's job opening survey. Hires dropping to 6.1 million, the lowest since February 2021, and the tech industry is shutting jobs percent more than last year.  PAVLINAC:  My perception of the job market was there were a ton of jobs out there and it was going to be easy to find a job, and that actually hasn't been the case. YURKEVICH:  Another crack of the 10.7 million open jobs, some companies might be advertising positions they aren't actively trying to fill. PAVLINAC:  I have applied to many jobs that they're still sitting there, that's been a giant question in my head.  YURKEVICH:  It's called pipelining talent. Companies post jobs to develop a pool of candidates. Recruiter Laura Mazzullo says she sees companies do it all the time. LAURA MAZZULLO, FOUNDER, EAST SIDE STAFFING:  Candidates don't know that's what's happening. So they're being pipelined when actually they think they're applying for an active job and this is where we're seeing a bit of a disconnect.  YURKEVICH:  That may mean as the labor market weakens, job seekers can't be as picky. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our goal is potentially to give away two jobs tonight. PAVLINAC:  I have been picking in that sense of where I want to work but I know what I want. I'm still searching, still talking to people. I've come to terms that it is taking longer than I thought. YURKEVICH:  Vanessa Yurkevich, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10 is from Minnesota man James Rasmussen as we head into the holiday season. He's hoping to avoid the terra bowel experience he had last season. He couldn't figure out who-who was cutting his outdoor Christmas lights. Turns out it was the owl who stole Christmas, using the lights to deck its own halls, its nest under Rasmussen's deck. Critters, there's no talon what they'll do. Better luck nest time Mr. Rasmussen. Without further owl do, a special shout out now to Ryan Middle in Fairbanks, Alaska. Wishing you and everyone watching around the world some motivation this Monday.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy. Grateful to be spending part of my day with you right here on CNN 10. We have a great show today, so let's get to it. We're going to begin with the news out of Bali where the G20 Summit is taking place. The global 20 is an intergovernmental forum between countries that addresses major issues related to the global economy. President Joe Biden held a three-hour talk Monday with the president of China, Xi Jinping. The meeting was their first in-person encounter since President Biden took office and an opportunity for both countries to improve deteriorating relations. Dialogue between them hit a new low in August when U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, a choice that upset China. Expectations for major change were low headed into the meeting. The White House said in a statement afterwards that President Biden raised concerns about China's human rights violations, but that the two countries found areas of agreement especially when it came to the war in Ukraine. In addition, the two nations promised to work together on global climate issues, world health and food security, and they pledge to keep communication open. But at the heart of the U.S.-Chinese relations is the Taiwan question. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Will Ripley in Taipei. The capital of ROC, the Republic of China, commonly known as Taiwan. This island is a vibrant democracy of $23 million people and a key ally of the United States, about 100 miles from mainland China. SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  And I'm Selina Wang in Beijing the capital of China, officially called the People's Republic of China. The PRC was founded in by the victorious Communist Party after a bloody civil war. RIPLEY:  On the losing side, the nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek who had ruled since the 1920s, they fled here to Taiwan where the ROC flag still flies today. Two sides both claiming control of one country, a decades-long dispute, halting travel and trade and leaving a lingering threat of war. WANG:  Initially, both the United States and the United Nations recognized Taipei as the seat of the Chinese government. But amid the shifting political relations at the height of the Cold War, that changed in the 1970s. The PRC replaced the ROC at the U.N. and the United States changed diplomatic relations. It moved its embassy from Taipei to here in Beijing. While the U.S. has adopted a so-called one China policy, it has never recognized the communist party sovereign claim over Taiwan. Washington continues to sell weapons to Taipei, but it has remained deliberately unclear about whether it would come to Taiwan's defense in the event of a Chinese invasion. It keeps Beijing guessing. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You know, you hear people saying Biden wants to start a new Cold War with China. I don't want a cold war with China. I just want to make China understand that we are not going to step back. We are not going to change any of our views. RIPLEY:  That looming threat of invasion is only part of China's ongoing campaign to squeeze Taiwan. Decades of diplomatic pressure by Beijing means this island has very few formal diplomatic allies, because any nation that wants to normalize relations with China has to sever formal diplomatic ties with Taipei. The island's Olympic team can't even carry the Taiwanese flag. They have to compete under the name Chinese Taipei. In Singapore, in 1992, the two sides did agree at least in theory to the existence of one China. WANG:  It's impossible to overstate just how important Taiwan is to the ruling communist party and its legitimacy. China sees the self-ruled island as a breakaway province that must be reunified with the mainland, even by force if necessary. Reunification is also rooted in the communist party's goal to reverse China's century of humiliation by colonial powers. That means returning China's borders to something more like that of the Qing Empire. It's the basis of modern China's claims to Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong and Taiwan. RIPLEY:  Putting sovereignty on the back burner gave Taiwan's economy a boost. Cross strait trade, tourism and money moving again. In 2015, the ruling parties on both sides met again in Singapore, a historic summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Taiwan's then President Ma Ying-jeou. One year later, a turning point. Taiwan's 2016 election of Tsai Ing-wen, the island's first female president, leading a longtime pro-independence party. Tensions rising ever since, something Taiwan blames on China's plan to push its power across the Indo-Pacific. Taiwan's young democracy divided on the issue of unification with the mainland. The tide is turning. In 2020, Tsai won a landslide re-election, vowing to defend Taiwan's democracy from she's increasingly powerful and authoritarian China. Cross strait ties plunging to their lowest level in decades. TSAI ING-WEN, PRESIDENT OF TAIWAN (translated):  The broadest consensus among the Taiwanese people and our various political parties is that we must defend our national sovereignty, our free and democratic way of life. On this point, we have no room for compromise. WANG:  With U.S.-China tensions at an all-time high, Washington and Taipei have moved closer. In 2016, then U.S. President-elect Donald Trump broke a decade-long precedent and spoke to President Tsai on the phone. He also elevated official exchanges between Washington and Taipei, a move that infuriated Beijing. RIPLEY:  China's refusal to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine has many here asking, what is Beijing planning for Taiwan, testing the island's defenses, flying scores of warplanes near the island, making President Xi's long-standing calls for peaceful reunification ring hollow? REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  We will not allow China to isolate Taiwan. RIPLEY:  In August 2022, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi became the highest ranking U.S. lawmaker to visit this island in 25 years, a move Beijing call a major political provocation. In response, China launched military exercises beyond the median line encircling the island. During her visit, Pelosi delivered the unequivocal message that America stands with Taiwan. But if the time comes, would the U.S. send in American troops to defend this Chinese-speaking democracy, a democracy with an uncertain future? (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: When compared to Earth, the atmosphere of Mars is? Thinner, thicker, or about the same? The atmosphere of Mars is over 100 times thinner than Earth. And actually, that thin atmosphere on Mars presents challenges for NASA. (END VIDEO CLIP) A new initiative from NASA called LOFTID could be a potential solution and will determine if a giant inflatable shield could protect spacecrafts against the heat of re-entering the atmosphere. The shield can withstand 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit and at feet in diameter, it's also the largest blunt object ever to return from space. The technology would help spacecrafts enter Mars's thin atmosphere because the Martian atmosphere can't decelerate a spacecraft as quickly and coolly as Earth's atmosphere. And we're ending today's show with a bang for 10 out of 10. Check out this massive explosion in western Kentucky. Drop them like it's hot. These three structures are actually cooling towers at a closed coal plant. The towers were 435 feet tall until they weren't. Tennessee Valley Authorities said the blast was done on purpose to clear the land for future use. The dramatic footage shows the towers slowly collapsing to the ground with clouds of dust all around. The Drakesboro, Kentucky, plant was active for nearly 60 years before effectively closing in 2020. And now to my favorite part of the day, I want to give a special shout out to Crown Point High School in Crown Point, Indiana. Go Bulldogs! Thank you so much for watching.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, everyone? It's Wednesday. Are you hanging in there? Let's smell the flowers and cool the soup.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10.  Just a few more days and we are on the Thanksgiving break. So let's rock. We're going to start today though with news out of India, where air quality is an ongoing issue.  New Delhi, India, is the world's most polluted capital according to IQAir, a Swiss company that measures air quality. It's blanketed in smog every winter as the cold air traps dust in the atmosphere above the city.  In March of this year, firefighters battled ablaze in New Delhi at a landfill site. The fire cloaked the area in a toxic haze and smoke choked residents for days. Factories, construction sites and primary schools were ordered to shut down, and Delhi authorities urged people to work from home. There's currently a debate in India over how to handle waste. There's no processing of waste in most Indian cities, according to the government's central pollution board and in some cases trash is simply burned in open dump yards on the roads. Delhi's 24-hour air quality index measures the concentration of harmful pollutants. Anything over 300 is considered hazardous and New Delhi's levels are as high as 470. The government is attempting to take stricter measures to tackle air quality as there are major health concerns for citizens in India.  We'll hear more now from Vedika Sud, a CNN reporter based at the New Delhi bureau who will introduce us to some of the people impacted by the poor air quality and explain the science behind the toxic air. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  Seventy-two-year-old shopkeeper Narayan Choudhary suffers from chronic asthma. He says he almost died in April this year after the landfill behind his house which is the size of a village caught fire.  NARAYAN CHOUDHARY, SHOPKEEPER (through translator):  It was a massive blade. It was difficult to survive. My face and nose started swelling. I was gasping for breath. I could barely drink or eat. SUD:  Choudhary says had it not been for his friend who rushed him to hospital, he wouldn't be here today. It was a dangerous combination of methane, unsegregated garbage and record high temperatures earlier this year that sparked massive fires not only at the Bhalswa landfill but also here at one of Asia's biggest dump sites. Government data from 2019 says this Ghazipur landfill is almost stories tall and the size of s soccer fields. Methane is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas and one company GHGSat found on a single day in March as trash decomposed more than two metric tons of methane gas leaked every hour from the Ghazipur landfill. STEPHANE GERMAIN, CEO, GHGSAT:  When we take all the measurements that we took over a period of about a year, we found that the total emissions were equivalent to emissions from approximately 350,000 U.S. passenger vehicles per year. SUD:  And methane emissions aren't the only hazard. Dangerous toxins from landfills seep into the ground polluting the water supply for thousands of residents living nearby. That's the color of the water, a pale, dirty yellow and we're barely hundred meters away from the foothill of the landfill. In May, CNN commissioned two accredited labs to test the groundwater around the Bhalswa landfill. The result, the groundwater within at least a 500-  meter radius around the wayside is contaminated. According to the labs, it's unfit for drinking.  In the first lab report, the total dissolves solids from all three samples were off the charts. Amid other parameters, levels of ammonia and sulfate was significantly higher than acceptable limits mandated by the Indian government. Results from the second lab report were equally worrying. Also iron traces in the first sample for both lab reports were at least eight times more than the permissible limit. And while authorities bring in a supply of clean water, residents say they're simply not enough for this densely populated neighborhood, and that they must buy and consume purified water.  As part of his Clean India Initiative, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said efforts are being made to remove these mountains of garbage and convert them into green zones. That goal if achieved could stem the suffering of those residents living in the shadows of these dump sites and go a long way to curb the massive amounts of methane being released into the atmosphere.  With more than 3,100 landfills, the task is monumental and so far unrealized. And if decisive action isn't taken soon, the consequences on the global climate fight could be catastrophic and the toll on human life unimaginable. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In what U.S. city would you find the famous museum complex nickname "the nation's attic"? New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles or Raleigh? The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. is home to 19 museums, 21 libraries and is home to over 154 million eclectic holdings. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Up next, we're traveling to Raleigh, North Carolina, to show you how big tech is making that city one of the fastest growing in the United States. Raleigh even gained the recognition as the Smithsonian of the South because of its booming art scene and all the free museums you can choose from. Let's check it out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  If you were to list the great art and educational centers of the U.S., you might think of New York or D.C. But you might be missing one, here, Raleigh, North Carolina. Raleigh has long been a museum Mecca with a vibrant art scene. Now, big companies like Google and Apple are moving into the area, helping to make it one of the fastest growing cities in the U.S. And as the city's grown, Raleigh has gained more recognition as a cultural destination. The area boasts more than locally owned art galleries, over 60 performing art spaces, and 140 pieces of public art in the downtown area, not to mention over 50 historic sites and 17 museums, most of which are free, leading some people to call Raleigh and its abundance of cultural institutions the Smithsonian of the south. VALERIE HILLINGS, DIRECTOR AND CEO, NORTH CAROLINA MUSEUM OF ART:  The state of North Carolina from the 20th century realized what an important thing it was to offer to its citizens free museums, giving everyone an opportunity to learn about and experience different subjects. We opened our doors in 1956. REPORTER:  The North Carolina museum of arts collection stretches across different cultures and eras. It has dedicated galleries to Rodin, Jewish ceremonial art. It even has an infinity mirror room sculpture by Yayoi Kusama, who has been nicknamed the most Instagramed artist in the world. HILLINGS:  As I like to say, all art is once contemporary and all art becomes history. We began to move single artworks around into other galleries, unexpected galleries, that really changed how people saw this collection. One of the Wileys has been a real fan favorite as it's been paired with an earlier portrait of King Louis showing two young men having a great sense of swagger., REPORTER:  The museum also has the largest connected art park in the country, at a whopping 164 acres. HILLINGS:  It becomes like an outdoor art gallery. REPORTER:  The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences is the largest of its kind in the Southeast and home to millions of plants animals gems and to the second biggest earth on Earth. CHRIS SMITH, COORDINATOR OF CURRENT SCIENCE PROGRAMS, NC MUSEUM OF NATURALK SCIENCES:  It's accurate down to the most minute detail. There's a lot of great ways to get close to nature here at the museum and a lot of great ways to learn about what's going on in the state of North Carolina.  One of the main highlights, the reasons to come visit are the whale skeletons. That whale the Smithsonian tried to take it and we were like no, we want it. These are dinosaurs that would have lived in prehistoric North Carolina. This is an eastern glass lizard and very active this morning good to see him out. There are 50 states, North Carolina is the best because North Carolina has a little bit of everything that everybody loves. REPORTER:  Whether you're interested in history, modern art or even Harley- Davidson drag racing, Raleigh's got you covered. HILLINGS:  Many of the things you can see not only in New York but at museums worldwide, you can see here in North Carolina. But also you can see things you won't see anywhere else.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANNOUNCER:  Five, four, stage engine start, three, two, one -- booster's ignition and liftoff of Artemis I. We rise together back to the moon and beyond. (END VIDEO CLIP) COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Happy Thursday, everyone, or as I like to say happy Friday eve. I'm Coy. Thankful to be hanging out with you. Time for the best 10 minutes in news right here on CNN 10. Let's rise together. We start today with the liftoff of the rocket we just saw. Yesterday, NASA launching its long-awaited Artemis moon rocket. The mission was a long time and a lot of money coming. NASA has spent more than billion dollars to date getting Artemis off the ground. But there were scrubbed launches hurricanes and mechanical issues that delayed takeoff for months. But the rocket finally got off the ground. This mission kicks off a key test of America's ability to send astronauts back to the moon. Can you believe the last time humans were on the moon was way back in 1972? That's 50 years ago. But hold on a moon-it, there won't be any humans on the moon just yet. There's no crew for this expedition. The rocket will come within 60 miles of the lunar surface before flying forty thousand miles beyond the moon and then looping back to Earth over three weeks' time. The journey will conclude with a splash when the rocket lands at sea on December 11th. We're going to hear now from CNN's space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher about the first test flight of the Artemis moon rocket. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT:  This is, of course, an uncrewed first test flight for the Artemis moon rocket. It is a SLS rocket, the space launch system rocket, with the Orion crew capsule on top. And so, what we've seen over the last few hours is launch and then the capsule separating from the rocket, and the rocket falling back to earth. And now, this little capsule, the Orion capsule, is now making its way to the moon. It's going to take about five or six days to get there. When it gets there, it's going to fly by very close to the moon just about feet off the lunar surface before then traveling farther out into space than any spacecraft ever designed to carry humans has ever flown, before flying back to earth testing out that all-important heat shield at the base of the Orion capsule before splashing down into the ocean. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia, Thanksgiving themed. What type of food was definitely not present in 1600s New England when Pilgrims first arrived? Cranberries, pumpkin, potatoes or corn? Potatoes which are native to South America hadn't been introduced to North America yet. They weren't established crops there until the 1700s. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Officially, one week away from Thanksgiving now. What's your favorite thanksgiving side dish mashed potatoes cream corn cornbread or stuffing or dressing as some folks like to call it? Whatever you love, be sure to really love and appreciate it this Thanksgiving. Because due to inflation, Thanksgiving dinner will cost 20 percent more this year than last, and that was already considered the most expensive Thanksgiving ever. We'll hear now from chief business correspondent Christine Romans on what you and your families can expect at the grocery store this holiday season. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  On the menu this year for Thanksgiving, rising prices. Overall, prices are up 7.7 percent from last year and grocery prices are more than 12 percent higher than a year ago. Here's what it means for the family grocery bill as you shop for the big day. First, the turkey. Per pound prices for turkey are up 17 percent year-  over-year. An average frozen turkey costs roughly $2.38 cents a pound. That's up from a $1.74. Now you can blame the avian flu outbreaks and hire fuel feed and labor costs because of inflation running near 40-year highs. What about eggs? Eggs cost 43 percent more than a year ago. Butter and margarine are up 33 percent. Flour is up nearly 25 percent. Your pies are going to cost more to make. These higher prices could potentially change Thanksgiving plans. A new Wells Fargo report suggests some Americans may opt to eat out rather than shop and cook at home this year. Dining out also can be cost the report says, but it may be a better value than one might expect. Government data backs that up year over year the cost of dining out rose at a slower pace than the cost of a typical grocery store run. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Speaking of Thanksgiving grubbing, one of the best parts is eating leftovers in my opinion like for days and days, right? But we all know some people get skeezed out by that. Did you know though that the United States wastes 108 billion pounds of food each year? Well, maybe it doesn't have to be like that. CNN reported on the science behind food storage with expert tips on how to best store your food and to keep your leftovers from going bad. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  The kitchen is the heart of our homes and fortress for our fresh food. Taking pride of place, these gleaming apples and bananas might look safe now, but when you open the fridge or cupboards a few days later, you can find your once fresh ingredients in a very different condition. And this often comes down to how you put them away in the first place. BRITTANY TOWERS LEWIS, FOOD SCIENTIST:  A lot of food is wasted. People buy in bulk and then end up not eating it. REPORTER:  So much food in fact that if food loss and waste were a country it would be the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases. To keep food for longer and help the planet and your household budget in the process, there are a few things to keep in mind. LEWIS:  One is time. So obviously the longer you keep something, it will eventually go bad. Oxygen, there's a lot of reactions that happen if you've heard of oxidation. That kind of causes apples to go brown, for example when you cut them. Moisture can increase microbial growth, which is something that we want to prevent because obviously bacteria, molds, light can also cause foods to spoil a little faster. Like potatoes, they're exposed to light. They can turn green. They produce sprouts for example. REPORTER:  So, to avoid waking up to potatoes like this, you should keep them in a cool dark place, in a breathable bag to avoid moisture, and away from fruits such as bananas. This is because bananas are climacteric foods which means they produce a lot of ethylene. LEWIS:  Ethylene, very fancy term. It's a gas that causes fruits and vegetables to ripen. That's why a lot of times when people are like, hey, you want to ripen something put it in a bag with a banana, because bananas produce a lot of ethylene. So, it'll cause it to ripen faster. REPORTER:  Salad leaves are another victim of bad storage, resulting in this all too familiar kitchen scene. LEWIS:  If you notice kind of your leaves aren't lasting as long a really great way is to rinse them off and make sure they're completely dry. Vinegar not only will help kill or monitor bacteria but it's also very acidic. So, most bacteria also don't like acidic environments. REPORTER:  And remember the role moisture plays. LEWIS:  Bacteria love water and that's what they use to grow. So, the more water you try to take out, the longer that they last. So, if you put a little paper towel in, keep it in your refrigerator, that will help keep the lettuce a little longer. REPORTER:  But when it comes to herbs, a little H20 used correctly goes a long way. LEWIS:  If you cut the bottom stem part off and kind of put them in some water, in your refrigerator, that can help keep them a little longer. They're like a living plant. So, they're in their little water and they're drinking it up, instead of in like a bag from the grocery store that kind of just like harbors just bacteria because everything's like stuck together. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10 is fantastic. Scientists discovering never seen before deep sea creatures at the bottom of the Indian Ocean near the Cocos Islands, an Australian territory. These fish are freaky. There's a deep-sea batfish looking like a baby Yoda thingy. And then this previously unknown species of blind eel. I mean, it makes me wonder what else could be down there or do we even want to know? All right. All my so-fish-ticated folks, it's about that time. I want to give a special shout-out to Marianna High School in Marianna, Florida. We see you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. We made it to the weekend. Friday's rock especially when they lead into a nice long holiday vacation. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and we are pumped to be right here with you to finish this week strong. We're starting today by concluding our months-long coverage of the midterm elections. Let's reflect. On November 8th, Americans cast their votes for representatives in Congress which consists of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, and they also voted for candidates for state and local offices. The elections are called midterms because they happen in the middle of a president's four-year term. After a close race and days of counting ballots Democrats retained the Senate, while Republicans won the House of Representatives. This means Republicans can stop a significant portion of President Biden's Democratic agenda. Remember, Congress makes nationwide laws. The House decides which laws are voted on. The Senate can approve or block them and confirm appointments made by the president. The candidates who won their position will take office this January so we won't see any changes until then. Pretty soon, the next batch of candidates will start campaigning for the elections in 2024 where the big race will be for president of the United States. We'll be here through the whole process updating you on the latest with no opinion or slant, just the facts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What country will host the 2022 World Cup? Japan, France, Qatar or Australia? The Middle Eastern nation of Qatar will host the 2022 international soccer tournament which kicks off on Sunday. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  The World Cup, it's one of the most popular sporting events of all time. Every four years, the best players from across the planet represent their nations in an epic soccer tournament. The world cup kicking off this Sunday in Qatar is the men's tournament. The women's is next year, and more than one million people are expected to travel to Qatar. That's more than a third of the nation's entire population. This year's tourney has been described though as the "World Cup of chaos". For the first time ever, it's not being played in the traditional summer months because for the first time ever, it's in the Middle East where the Qatari desert would have been scorching hot during that time. So, players in top leagues across the world are having to play this World Cup in the middle of their club seasons, meaning they'll be exhausted. Also, the country of Qatar has been criticized for its human rights record. More now from CNN anchor and correspondent Isa Soares. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEPP BLATTER, FORMER FIFA PRESIDENT:  The winner to organize the 2022 FIFA World Cup is Qatar. ISA SOARES, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The sports world was stunned when FIFA awarded the World Cup to Qatar. Controversy took center stage and football risked becoming a sideshow. Why was Qatar, a tiny desert state with no football pedigree, chosen to host FIFA's showpiece event? Even the disgraced former chief of football's governing body has since described the decision as a mistake. BLATTER:  I was right at a certain time to say it is -- we should not go there. SOARES:  That move, 12 years ago, provoked unprecedented anger, accusations of corruption, and sportswashing. Qatari officials strongly denied the allegation that bribery was involved in their bid. Before a ball is kicked at the year's tournament, attention has focused on Qatar's human rights record. Its stance on same-sex relationship, and most damaging to its reputation, the treatment of overseas workers drafted in to build essential infrastructure. Amnesty International claims authorities failed to properly investigate the deaths of thousands of migrant workers despite evidence linking premature deaths with unsafe working conditions in the searing heat. Qatari officials say they investigate all reports of abuse and exploitation and are committed to holding unscrupulous employers to account. When the final whistle goes at Qatar 2022, the legacy will be judged not only over 28 days of football but in the years that lie ahead. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, this is a sad and uncertain time for many people across the tech industry. Many workers are scrambling to seek new opportunities. Fears of recession, rising interest rates and a shift to pre-pandemic lifestyles have all dealt major blows to the tech industry. More than 35,000 tech workers across 72 companies have been laid off just this month, for a total of 120,000 tech jobs lost this year. We'll hear now from CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich who has more on the future of the industry. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In three weeks, the tech industry lost tens of thousands of jobs. Historic layoffs at Twitter, Meta, Lyft and Amazon. Layoffs.fyi, a crowdsourced layoff tracking site, puts it at more than 35,000 layoffs so far this month. ROGER LEE, FOUNDER, LAYOFFS.FYI:  That's the highest month since the pandemic. So that beats April 2020, which was 17,000 employees laid off. YURKEVICH:  Meta cut its workforce by 13 percent. CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying he's taking accountability and apologizing to those impacted. New owner Elon Musk slashed half of Twitter staff with founder Jack Dorsey tweeting: The company grew too quickly, I apologize for that. And Amazon is laying off ten thousand workers this week, citing an unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment. NELA RICHARDSON, CHIEF ECONOMIS, ADP RESEARCH INSTITUTE:  There were big investments made during the pandemic time while the rest of the economy for example was plummeting by 3.4 percent. Tech grew by four percent. YURKEVICH:  But in a post-pandemic high inflation world, consumer behaviors and spending habits are changing, with the threat of recession on the horizon. RICHARDSON:  I take this as a sign that maybe companies got over their skis at some point right and they're trying to kind of sit upright again. YURKEVICH:  Roger Lee founded layoffs.fyi as the pandemic unfolded. Recently, he's been digging deeper into the numbers. LEE:  There have been many companies who have been letting go half or more of their recruiting HR teams just because they're not hiring as many people anymore. YURKEVICH:  Aaron Backman, a recruiter at a tech company, was one of those layoffs. What did that feel like for you? AARON BACKMAN, LAID OFF FROM TECH COMPANY:  It was a really awful feeling. We were told really early in the morning an email saying layoffs are coming today. And if you get a call, it's going to be you. And I sat there for six hours on slack and watched my colleagues get laid off one by one. YURKEVICH:  Then he got the call. BACKMAN:  It's depressing. YURKEVICH:  As American workers watch tech giants shed jobs at a rapid clip, many in other industries are asking, am I next? Should they be nervous? RICHARDSON:  First of all, the tech economy are just two percent of the labor market. Tech is an important part of the economy but it is not the whole of the economy. The rest of the labor market is looking pretty good. The economy is adding jobs at a pretty healthy clip. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's out 10 of 10 is quite relephant to what we do here at CNN 10.
