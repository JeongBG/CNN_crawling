COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Bad news it's only Thursday. Good news it's Friday eve and we're going to slay today. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and we have a powerful show for you today. And we start with the ongoing and devastating situation occurring in Nigeria in West Africa. A month ago, the country experienced its worst flooding in a decade. Hundreds were killed as homes and businesses were submerged. Weeks later, the death toll has risen and communities remain underwater, displacing more than one million people from their homes.  Victims of the flood blame the tragedy on the government's response or lack thereof. Government officials say they released flood warnings ahead of the disaster and advised residents to move to safer ground. There is a question as to whether those warnings even reach some communities and experts say proper relief has not reached many Nigerians. Food is scarce in the country and difficult for many to afford. Nigeria's economy is struggling. Inflation hit a 17-year high of over 20 percent in August. This has further strained people's spending power and capacity to relocate. People have lost everything and many survivors are living in terrible conditions in camps and shelters with little to no government assistance. CNN correspondent Larry Madowo has been reporting on this for us on the ground in Bayelsa, Nigeria, where he's seen firsthand the tragic events that people there are facing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Our communities still submerged nearly a month after the flooding began with no end in sight. Boats have become the only way to get around much of Bayelsa State in Southern Nigeria. The streets have turned to rivers, driving entire communities away from their homes.  We have really suffered, she says. Tell the government to help us. UGERE OBI, FLOOD VICTIM:  Again, tell them to come help us. MADOWO:  Everything you own is here under the water and this is your house? OBI:  Yes. Everything. MADOWO:  Some are living rough on the streets, washing with this water, cooking with it and bathing in it. Even people's homes and businesses and livelihoods are already submerged, it's still raining and there is more expected. The Nigerian government is warning this could go until November, so even more of this. This is Nigeria's worst flooding in a decade.  Aniso Handy has remained in this house through it all. ANISO HANDY, FLOOD VICTIM:  Nigerians are used to manage. If not, we would have all died. We have not seen this situation where people are not cared for. But Nigerians care for themselves. We are just like infants that have no father, no mother. MADOWO:  The feeling of abandonment runs deep here. The victims are disappointed with the Nigerian government's response which hasn't declared the flood a national emergency. The floods have affected 33 of Nigeria's 36 states partly due to well above average rainfall.  Bayelsa is among those cut off from the nation with major highways underwater. The situation has been exacerbated by poor drainage infrastructure and an overflowing dam in neighboring Cameroon.  But with a warmer climate causing more intense rainfall, authorities have also blamed it on climate change, angering some Nigerians. In this community though, there are more short-term consequences. It's a tough life to navigate for humans and animals alike, but life must go on.  Larry Madowo, CNN, Bayelsa State, Nigeria. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up today, a debate around driverless cars. Are they safe? Are they needed? Are they helpful?  Well, what do you think?  The technology continues to be tested in various cities around the U.S. and one company called Waymo just announced it's planning to launch robo taxis in one of America's most populated cities, Los Angeles. They've already been tested in Phoenix, Arizona, and San Francisco.  We're talking fully autonomous or self-controlled driverless rides relying on detailed maps and sensors to navigate their surroundings. Proponents say these electric vehicles would provide more eco-friendly modes of transportation, while opponents of safety concerns and say that technology is not quite ready to be taken mainstream. CNN transportation editor Michael Ballaban gives us a glimpse now at a recent experience he had with the full self-driving technology available in a Tesla. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL BALLABAN, CNN TRANSPORTATION EDITOR:  Oh, we've got a situation in front of us. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, no, we're going on the wrong side of the road. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Nope, nope, nope. It wanted to hit the truck.  This is a Tesla model 3. So we are turning on the full self-driving beta. Okay, the car is now officially technically sort of driving itself. Whoa, whoa, that was a really sharp turn the car just tried to make. Oh, we've got a situation in front of us. Whoa. Okay, what we just had in front of us was a UPS truck coming onto our lane. We had a guy in front of us with a cargo bike. To avoid hitting the guy on the bike, the car seemed to want to put us straight into a giant UPS truck. I would prefer not to hit a UPS truck today. So I took over. It does seem to need an interruption every couple of blocks or so. Sometimes if the car is hesitating a little bit I have to intervene. You also have to be ready to take over at any time. Now, this is challenging. Oh, no, we're going on the wrong side of the road. We're not trying to make this car screw up. We're not trying to have a laugh at Elon Musk's suspense. That's not the point. We're really just trying to see how it handles driving in the city.  So far, it's going okay. We're going down a pretty just straight normal road. There's not a lot of pedestrians here and when you're going down a straight road with not a lot of pedestrians, the car actually seems to be doing okay. We're doing right around the speed limit. You know, we're not hitting anything.  The car can see cones. The car can see trucks. The car can see even pedestrians on the other side of the street.  Seeing might not be totally the issue here, it's knowing what to do in challenging situations, stuff that experience teaches you. A lot of people have issues with this being called full self-driving. First and foremost, it's not fully self-driving, I have to sit here. If it was fully self-  driving as promised that would let you take a nap, while you're driving along.  You know, it does seem to be making all the drivers upset. It's the people behind us it's the people honking. Now I'm not saying of truly fully autonomous car will never happen but I think at this point we're still years away. SUBTITLE:  Tesla did not respond to CNN Business' request for comment. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  I like to think of myself as a fun guy, but I've got nothing on these guys. Did you know that mushrooms are the largest life forms on the planet? Yep, they expand and grow underground with interconnected fibers called mycelium, looking for food, often nutrients from soil and trees, alive or dead. In fact, the largest living organism on Earth right now is a single honey mushroom in the Malheur National Forest in Oregon. It's three and a half miles wide about 2,500 acres, and it's believed to be about 2,400 years old. Now, that's a humongous fungus and that's random. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  All right. Halloween is exactly two peace signs days away, and I am loving your costume suggestions that you've been sending me on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok. Lex Luthor, Mr. Clean, keep them coming. I'm @CoyWire there. And speaking of TikTok, 73-year-old sensation Barbara "Babs" Costello has given folks pumpkin to talk about. Carving tips like sprinkling cinnamon in there to treat your olfactory senses. Oh my gord. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBARA COSTELLO, TIKTOK SENSATION:  I'm going to remove all those nasty strings the easier way. SUBTITLE:  This 73-year-old TikTok sensation gave us some hacks on how to improve the spooky season.  In a new video, Barbara "Babs" Costello broke down the do's and don'ts of pumpkin carving.  COSTELLO:  Hi, everybody. It's Babs. Did your mom ever tell you the do's and don'ts of pumpkin carving? SUBTITLE:  1. Carve the pumpkin from your lap. COSTELLO:  Don't stand and carve your pumpkin. Sit. Just put them on your lap. SUBTITLE:  2. Carve from the bottom of your pumpkin. COSTELLO:  Now time to cut the bottom of your pumpkin, not the top.  SUBTITLE:  3. Use a hand mixer to clean out your pumpkin. COSTELLO:  Don't do this. Use your hand mixer instead. Get all those strings cleaned up. Your mixer did the hard work of loosening all those strings. SUBTITLE:  4. Use a red dry erase marker to design the face. COSTELLO:  When designing your pumpkin face, use a dry erasable red marker that you can get rid of the lines after you carve.  SUBTITLE:  5. Carve the design with a rubber mallet and a cookie cutter. COSTELLO:  If you don't want to struggle using a knife to carve your pumpkin, just use a soft-headed mallet and your cookie cutter, and just push it right through. Remove all your red lines. SUBTITLE:  6. Cover all surfaces with Vaseline to keep it fresh. COSTELLO:  Don't let all your work go to waste. Those kids want to enjoy these pumpkins. Take Vaseline and rub it on all the open cut surfaces. We'll keep your pumpkin moist won't dry out as quickly, and it should last about one to two weeks.  SUBTITLE:  7. And finally, sprinkle some cinnamon. COSTELLO:  And if you want a beautifully scented jack-o-lantern, try sprinkling some cinnamon right on the top and over the candle she goes and she smells delicious. Happy Halloween. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. You gorgeous creatures, today is National Civics Day, celebrating the importance of civic education as a foundation for a strong democracy.  And we want to give a strong shout out now, Walnut Cove, North Carolina, Southeastern Stokes Middle School. Rise up and have an awesome day.  It's almost Friday. See you tomorrow.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. It's your boy Coy, and it's Thursday. So, happy Friday eve to you. This is CNN 10. We have an awesome show for you today, so without further ado, let's do what we do. We start today with the latest news out of China. Foxconn, one of Apple's largest suppliers, is racing to control a COVID-19 outbreak at its campus in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou. Trending social media videos show anxious workers reportedly fleeing the lockdown facility earlier this week after experiencing food shortages and difficult living conditions, including mandatory isolation. The city, which has a population of more than 12 million people, identified dozens of COVID-19 cases last month and the Chinese government shows few signs of easing its COVID policies. These events highlight how China's strict zero COVID policy is hurting international business. We'll hear now from my colleague Selina Wang, the CNN international correspondent, reporting on the chaotic conditions at the Foxconn factory. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Chaos at Foxconn, one of Apple's largest suppliers. It's Zhengzhou factory, which is its largest iPhone assembly factory in central China, is trying to contain a COVID flare-up but workers are fleeing the COVID restrictions. Viral videos on social media show masses of workers carrying their luggage trekking long distances across highways. Workers in recent days have been flooding social media with complaints about subpar living conditions, the poor quality of food and the difficulty and getting enough food amid the intense COVID restrictions. The exodus is putting major strain on Foxconn at a critical period just before the holiday season. It's another reminder of how China's zero COVID policy is hurting international businesses. According to analyst estimates, the Zhengzhou factory accounts for as much as 85 percent of Apple's iPhone assembly capacity. According to Counterpoint Research, they estimate that this could jeopardize 10 to 30 percent of the iPhone-14 production if this situation doesn't stabilize in the near term. Now, according to state media, Foxconn is trying to boost capacity production at other sites. The company says it is actually quadrupling bonuses for workers at the Zhengzhou plant in order to incentivize workers to stay. But zero COVID is clearly still having a massive impact on businesses, on people's daily lives, the entire city of Zhengzhou, which is home to more than 12 million people, it's been under lockdown since late October. These constant lockdowns in China are causing global businesses to re- evaluate the reliability of China as a production base. In fact, Apple has been increasing production in places like India in order to reduce its dependency on China. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In Spanish, the word "manta" means what? Blanket, bread, balloon or basket. Manta refers to a type of cloak or blanket which is why manta rays share the name describing the look of the animal's large flat diamond-shaped bodies. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Today is CNN's Call to Earth Day, which aims to highlight the conservation work of organizations and individuals around the world and in connection with that. We have a special feature with marine scientists and Rolex Awards laureate Kerstin Forsberg who's working to protect manta rays in her home country of Peru. I recently had a chance to talk with her about her experience beneath the waves. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KERSTIN FORSBERG, MARINE BIOLOGIST AND CONSERVATIONIST:  The ocean is our source of life. The ocean touches us in every single second. It's, you know, connected with our atmosphere. The ocean provides resources. The ocean provides oxygen in our planet. The ocean provides so many different things to inspire us even on a cultural or emotional level. WIRE:  What made you fall in love with the ocean? Why did you choose this path? FORSBERG:  I was passionate about nature and environment and animals ever since I was a kid. I was always reading about animals, reading about nature. And then I think as I grew up and I decided to start a career in biology, it became really clear to me that the ocean was in real trouble, and that a lot of people needed to really start to think about the importance that the ocean has on our everyday lives. WIRE:  You have designed and developed dozens of environmental initiatives. What are some of the biggest challenges facing our oceans and ocean life right now? FORSBERG:  We're taking all the resources out of it. We're polluting the ocean. We're putting all our waste and dumping all their waste into it. So it's really about thinking of us as our everyday and how we connect to the ocean, and how we can depend on the ocean, but we can also shape the ocean. So, through sustainable seafood consumption, through making sure that we are utilizing our waste properly, and that's how we're going to ultimately stop those challenges which at the end are all about over-exposition, pollution and also climate change and habitat destruction. We started building a network of schools. It's called the Marine Educators Network of Northern Peru. And this network of schools started to grow, in over local schools in northern Peru, connecting between each other with teachers starting to incorporate ocean literacy within classrooms, but then building on that having youth start developing their own environmental projects that benefited their communities. First of all, we work with schools. We partner together with schools and with teachers and we develop an ocean literacy training program in which kids learn about the ocean, learn about how we're connected to the ocean. But even beyond that, they learn about environmental leadership and how to develop their own project. So we're giving them the tools on how to develop a project how to set out goals how to develop your own budget, how to track your progress and in doing that connect kids so we've developing feedback between each other and really developing this sense of global citizenship at the end, right? We all need to start connecting between our ourselves as global citizens in order to move forward and address sustainability challenges. WIRE:  Well, we have a special day, Call to Earth Day. I'm sure you have something up your sleeve or two. FORSBERG:  For Call to Earth Day, we will be hosting an activity in northern Peru, with over 40 different youth. These are local university students and we're partnering with a series of local organizations, including from the regional government and civil society and conservation areas. So, it's really about having everybody together. It's going to be a huge celebration, where different organizations come together, with different youth come together, and again, we're different disciplines, right? Come together, and ultimately, land and sea come together So, that's what it's all about for us, Call to Earth. It's a celebration of our planet that connects us all. WIRE:  Kerstin Forsberg, your -- your smile, your passion are contagious. You inspire us as we aspire to make this world a bit of a better place. Thank you so much for joining us. FORSBREG:  Thank you so much for the invitation. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, we may have bitten off more than we can choo choo. The world's longest ever passenger train took a trip through the Swiss Alps. What ingenuity, this train is 1.2 miles long, made up of a hundred cars, it had to be a slowcomotive, taking about an hour to complete a 15-mile trip, through 22 tunnels, over 48 bridges. The record-breaking event took place on October 29th, the 175th anniversary of Switzerland's first railway. For your news, for some fun, we're here for you train or shine. And so is shout-out time. Mrs. Bush's class at Bosqueville Middle School in Waco, Texas. Think it, speak it, believe it. Did you know that today, November 3rd is National Stress Awareness Day. So, like my four-year-old daughter tells me, smell the flowers, cool the soup. Whenever you feel overwhelmed, don't fret about the future. Don't worry about the past. Just take a deep breath and embrace the power of now. I'm Coy and this is CNN 10. END221103

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey you. You made it to Friday, and you already know Friday's rock. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. And we've got an awesome show for you today. Let's finish this week strong. I have some good news to start your weekend. Many of you get an extra hour of sleep on Sunday, Daylight Saving Time. But could this be the last year of it? Every year on the first Sunday of November at 2:00 a.m., many of us turn our clocks back an hour. On the second Sunday in March, they spring back forward an hour. But where did this idea of shifting time come from and why is it so polarizing? Let's take 10 to break it all down. While Benjamin Franklin gets credit for the first mention of the idea, Daylight Saving Time was first implemented in the U.S. with the Standard Time Act of 1918. A wartime measure with the purpose of adding more daylight hours to conserve energy resources Currently, not all states participate in daylight saving, including most of Arizona and Hawaii. Over 70 countries around the world use daylight saving time with notable exceptions of China and Japan. But earlier this year, the U.S. Senate passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act which would make Daylight Saving Time permanent year round, beginning in the fall of 2023. That bill is currently sitting in the House of Representatives. If passed there and then signed by the president, it would mean no more changing clocks in the U.S. There are, of course, arguments for and against the practice. We'll travel to the United Kingdom now to meet a small group of clockmakers who have a big job of making sure everything is working on time, especially when it comes to the time change. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX JEFFREY, CLOCKMAKER, PALACE OF WESTMINSTER:  I love talking about clocks. I could talk about clocks all day. Not everyone wants to hear about them, but everyone wants to hear about the clocks at the Palace of Westminster. Whether it's Big Ben, whether it's just being interested in such a busy building, working on clocks, doing the time change, maintaining, it's something I take a lot of pride in. REPORTER:  Ian Westworth and Alex Jeffrey are part of a small team of clockmakers at the Palace of Westminster in London. Twice a year, when the clocks spring forward or fall back across the United Kingdom, they have the responsibility of adjusting 2,000 timepieces before lawmakers return to work. JEFFREY:  There's two thousand clocks on the parliamentary estate. There's 500 heritage clocks, there's two days and it's our task to perform the GMT time change. IAN WESTWORTH, CLOCMAKER, PALACE OF WESTMINISTER:  And overnight, we changed Big Ben. The great clock of Westminster and we put that back an hour just to make sure everybody who can now see the dials can actually tell at the right time when they wake up on Sunday morning. JEFFREY:  So, this is one of our heritage clocks. There's around four or five hundred of them, and they're just going to bring the minute hand back to do the time change being careful not to graze the dial, and it's -- in one of the committee rooms along committee corridor where a lot of important meetings happen. WESTWORTH:  We have clocks here that pre-date this palace and some that were designed specifically for this palace. We do actually come across clocks that we've never found before. It only happened the other week. An MP contacted us saying, I've got a clock in my office, it hasn't run for some time. And I'm thinking, I've been here 18 years and I've never been into your office. He said that's probably why it hasn't worked. JEFFREY:  The time changes were put in initially as a mechanism, a practical mechanism to take advantage of daylight hours in the summer. So, it's important I think to keep that tradition. REPORTER:  In the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill championed the concept of daylight saving during the First World War before he became prime minister, believing that the country could save energy by stretching the hours of evening sunlight. The practice has spread across the world. In the U.S. most states observe daylight saving moving clocks forward in the spring. Only Hawaii and most of Arizona don't. In 2022, the Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act, a law which would make Daylight Saving Time permanent across the United States from November 5th, 2023. If passed by the House, the clocks would not fall back again. In the U.K., a 2019 poll showed that a small majority of Britons want to keep changing the clocks. At the Palace of Westminster, its resident clockmakers are responsible for maintaining this tradition. WESTWORTH:  Even with this digital world, you know, everybody's got a computer with a clock at the bottom or they've got a digital watch on. But the MPS and the lords or the staff, who've actually got a ticking clock in their office. One of the first things they look at is the ticking clock and not the one on the wrist. Our job is to make sure that every day, these clocks are working for them. The last clock of the day before doing great clock tonight. JEFFREY:  You know, there's a lot of ground to cover. I left my step count on last year and it was 55,000 steps. It's very time consuming but it's very rewarding. You know, we can say to each other, well done, guys. It's a job well done and when people turn up for work on Monday, they're right on time. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And now it's time for some hero talk. We've been introducing you to CNN Heroes since the start of the school year. Together, we met a woman upcycling old computers to open new worlds for young people in our home country of Kenya. We met a teacher in New Jersey on a mission to hand out free books by the thousands. This week, CNN announced the top heroes of the year. Let's meet them and hear how they are making this world a better place. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  From California when elderly dog owners can no longer care for their pets, Carie Broecker helps them stay together or finds these beloved family members new forever homes. From Nashville, Richard Casper uses art to heal the wounds of war. He's helping fellow veterans share their stories visually and vocally. Nelly Cheboi is bringing technology to young people in her native Kenya, recycling old computers, she provides the tools and education for brighter futures. North Carolina innovator Nora El-Khouri Spencer is training women for well- paying careers in construction while also helping seniors age safely at home. From south Philadelphia after spending five years in prison on drug charges, Tyrique Glasgow is now providing his neighborhood long challenged by poverty and gun violence with safety and opportunity. Alaskan nurse Teresa Gray leads volunteer medics into global hot spots, delivering vital care and support to those in need. Meymuna Hussein-Cattan is helping refugees and immigrants transition to lives in the U.S. with critical resources and support while also sharing their culture with the L.A. community. Aidan Reilly brought together a nationwide network of young volunteers tackle food waste and insecurity they're rescuing tons of excess produce from farms to feed the hungry. From Chicago, Deborah Vines struggled to find support and resources when her son Jason was diagnosed with autism. Now, she's providing services and education to African American families and first responders. And Atlanta's Bobby Wilson is feeding and healing his urban community by teaching thousands of people how to plant grow and prepare their own healthy food. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: American, Bridal Veil, and Horseshoe are features that combine to make what natural wonder? Great Barrier Reef, Niagara Falls, Grand Canyon, or Galapagos Islands. Located on the U.S. Canadian border, these are the names of the three waterfalls that together make Niagara Falls. (END VIDEO CLIP) WEIR:  We're giving this next story an A-plus, a gold star, and a 10 out of 10. Niagara Falls, one of the natural wonders of the world, on the New York and Canadian border, draws visitors from every corner of the planet who come to see its majestic cascading water. Well, there's a tunnel buried deep beneath the falls. It's been off limits until now. It's about seven football fields long it was built more than a century ago on the Canadian side as part of the former Niagara Parks Power Station. And visitors can now venture through the plant down the corridor and onto a waterside platform for some of the most breathtaking views in the world. This has been an awesome week.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  It is Monday and it's going to be the best day because it's the next day. I'm Coy, here with your news, some inspiration and a little bit of fun. Thanks for choosing us to help you start your week strong. We begin today with news on the Mississippi River. This video shows the river at historically low levels from Illinois to Louisiana. Experts say the record low water levels are due to the worst drought in the central part of the United States in at least a decade and that we can expect to see continued decreasing levels in the months to come. Lack of rain or snow over a period of time and atmospheric conditions such as temperature change and changes in the jet stream are all factors that can contribute to drought and low water levels. According to the U.S. drought monitor, half of the United States is covered by moderate drought conditions or worse, with more than 134 million people affected. That's the highest part of the population since 2016. And the Midwest has seen the worst of it. Several inches of rain are possible over the next week near the Mississippi River which could provide some relief but the drought is forecast to continue through January and low water levels have some serious consequences. They could impact crops at a crucial time for harvest and allow for salt water from the Gulf of Mexico to travel up the Mississippi River which could potentially spoil Louisiana drinking water with salt.  And while the Army Corps of Engineers has been dredging or excavating portions of the river's basin to make a path for boat traffic to keep flowing. It's at such a slow pace, hundreds of barges and vessels carrying goods are waiting for the all-clear to be able to pass through the shallow river. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  To navigate this river in the old South, a man would stand on the prowess steam ship and bounce a lead weight on a knotted string off the bottom. If it was a safe 12 feet deep, he'd shout "Mark Twain". Samuel Clemens made that his pen name, of course.  But if he wrote about this river today, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn would spend a lot of time walking on the beach because in too many places, the not so mighty Mississippi is a fraction of a Twain. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're going to look at a few old steamboats, steamboat racks. WEIR:  Mark Twain era steamboats? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah. WEIR:  And the relentless drought across the heartland is exposing all kinds of memories. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It may have caught on fire or sank 50 miles upstream and floated here during floods. WEIR:  As far as water levels go, this is as worse if you've ever seen? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is about as low as I've seen it. WEIR:  From the Missouri down to New Orleans, accidental archaeologists are finding steamboat graveyards and human remains, Civil War ammo and forgotten shipwrecks. And one of the more striking yardsticks is here in Baton Rouge. This is the USS Kidd, a World War II destroyer, and on a good year the Mississippi comes to that first rush strike, about 25 feet above my head right now. And these water levels are so low creating such a catastrophic shipping crisis that this is going to affect your grocery bill, is the price of moving. A bushel of soybeans went up 300 percent and there are thousands of barges full of food and all they can do is just wait and pray for rain. And if they can't get rain, they pray for help. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We've got a difficult stretch of river. WEIR:  From the Army Corps of Engineers, with billions of dollars on the line, they cut channels as fast as they can with working antiques like the Dredge Potter. Built in 1932 but still a workhorse and an endless fight with the river in every kind of weather. You're a professional riverbed redecorator. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kind of, yeah, yeah.  WEIR:  A little of this over here. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's right. WEIR:  Over there. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As long as we can keep barges moving and keep commodities prices down, we're all in good shape. WEIR:  That's your -- that's your mission. It's impressive to see up front. Andy, you know the Ole Miss better than most, huh? You've been doing this a while. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thirty-four years. (LAUGHTER) WEIR:  And how would you characterize what's going on these days? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is a concern, a heightened concern. I don't know that I -- we call it a panic yet, but we are watching the water levels very closely, on an almost an hourly basis.  WEIR:  Is it the kind of thing where if this goes on you can dredge around the problem? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  To a point. In 1989 and then again in 2012, we got to an area where the chan -- to a level where the channel was almost unsustainable. So we had numerous dredges working and there was very little commerce going through. And ultimately, what saved the day was rain. WEIR:  And these days, when you wish for rain, you have to specify not all at once. The Midwest is still recovering from summer flash floods. And if the water cycle whiplashes again, hard rain on parched earth would be another blow to farmers, already struggling to move their harvest.  Fewer and lighter barges on the river means more expensive trains and trucks putting more planet cooking pollution into Earth's system. And on a connected planet where one in eight humans eat something that was moved down the Mississippi, those hearty souls on the Dredge Potter are going to need a lot more help.

But everything from fuel leaks to hurricanes have already stalled the mission. Liftoff is now scheduled for November 14th and Artemis is back on the launch pad waiting for its big moment. But if you can't wait, there may be a way for you to get that moonwalking feeling right here on Earth. A new invention from Shift Robotics aims to make walking faster and more efficient. But will they revolutionize the way we walk? That remains to be seen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) XUNJIE ZHANG, CEO, SHIFT ROBOTICS:  Instead of replacing walking, what if we can augmenting or enhancing walking? REPORTER:  These are not roller skates, they are moonwalkers designed by Shift Robotics, a startup out of the robotics lab at Carnegie Mellon University. ZHANG:  I think the biggest problem is just the walking is too slow, it's super inefficient to get around by walking. So instead of replacing walking, what if we can you know augmenting or enhancing walking? REPORTER:  The company says these battery powered shoes can boost walking speeds up to seven miles an hour. Using a machine learning algorithm, Shift Robotics says the shoes can adapt to a user's walking pattern in real time. ZHANG:  You know, even though it has some elements of roller skate. You never freeloading, you just go -- they only move when you want to move. REPORTER:  Moonwalkers can fit most shoes with flexible straps that can be easily taken on and off with magnetic buckles. With speed limitation tech and braking systems the company claims the shoes are safe to use on on sidewalks or in crowded areas. ZHANG:  Outside the personal commuting or running errand scenes we think they're going to be great on distribution centers supermarket stores like warehouses for example where it's not fully automated but that still require lots of people walking around. REPORTER:  Shift Robotics also claims that users can walk over six miles after a single charge of an hour and a half. The company says it will deliver the first batch of shoes to consumers in March 2023 at nearly fourteen hundred dollars.  ZHANG:  I think at one day, you know, once we achieve economy scales, we will be able to drop the price we will be able to develop newer models that will allow us ultimately to drive the cost down.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is a hoot, a textbook example of parody by a parrot. TV reporter Nicholas Crum was in Chile telling a story about rising crime rates when a parrot pulls off an impeccable heist stealing the headphone right out of his ear. He gone. Crum, he needs to be more careful. He had someone else chase the thief for him so he could continue his report. Apparently, Crum suspected foul play. Well, the whole thing was caught on camera and where it is, he did get his headphone back. All right. Without feather ado, my favorite parrot of the day, I want to give a special shout out to West Side Middle School in Charleston, West Virginia.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, hello. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy. Grateful to be spending part of my day right here with you on CNN 10. Today is the first Tuesday in November and that means election day across America. Millions of Americans head to the polls to cast their ballots but they won't be choosing the next U.S. president. Americans will cast their votes for representatives in Congress and candidates for state and local offices.  Every two years, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for election while only about a third of the 100-seat Senate are up for grabs. These are called midterm elections because they happen two years into a U.S. president's four-year term. The midterms are the first chance for voters to weigh in on President Biden's term, policies and vision for America. All eyes are on Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania, four states that President Biden flipped to Democrat in the election but are now battlegrounds states that Republicans could win back. Issues at the top of mind for voters are, the economy, social issues, immigration, concerns about violent crime and concerns about election security and the election process itself.  This year, early voting has surged in some key states, including Georgia, which shattered records for early voter turnout but rain forecasted across the country today could impact voter turnout on election day. We'll hear more now from CNN's Karin Caifa about today's elections and what Americans might expect as results come in. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARIN CAIFA, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  President Joe Biden isn't on the ballot, but for most Americans, it's their first chance to weigh in on his party and policies. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This election isn't a referendum, it's a choice. It's a choice between two fundamentally different visions of America. CAIFA:  Among states taking center stage in the battle for the U.S. Senate tight races in four that president Biden flipped in the 2020 presidential election, Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania were Biden and former President Barack Obama stumped Saturday. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT:  Democracy itself is on the ballot. The stakes are high.  CAIFA:  And former President Donald Trump also rallied. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT:  This election is your chance to make your voice heard. CAIFA:  Underscoring how 2022 may foreshadow the 2024 presidential contest. Polls indicate most voters are looking at the economy right now as they cast ballots. Democrats touted Friday's October jobs report and unemployment still near a half century low as assigned their economic policies are working, while Republicans point to the highest inflation in 40 years.  SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI):  The inflation crushing our pocketbooks, can't fill up our tank, can't fill up our grocery cart. CAIFA:  Democrats hope the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June will motivate voters, especially women, while Republicans have accused Democrats of being weak on crime especially in major cities.  Both parties eager to drive turnout in their favor. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Name the peninsula in Egypt located between the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea. Sinai, Iberian, Arabian or Yucatan? Sinai peninsula is the answer here and at the southern tip is where you'll find the Egyptian city of Sharm El-sheikh. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  This week and next in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, tens of thousands of world leaders, representatives, negotiators, businesses and citizens will gather for the COP27 Conference. Twenty-seven because this is the 27th year that the global climate summit has been held. The focus of these conferences is climate change. The U.N. says this was a fringe issue when the summits began, but it's now a global priority though different nations have different levels of commitment to it. Carbon dioxide emissions are front and center here. Most scientists say these emissions are harming the global environment by causing earth's average temperatures to rise a smaller group of scientists says that climate change happens naturally and that the earth can absorb human carbon emissions. But the goal of these U.N. summits is for member countries to lay out new plans to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide. Let's take a look now at the history of these COP conferences as nations continue to debate the issues that relate to the health of the planet. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  COP stands for Conference of the Parties. The gatherings are intense technical negotiations brokered by the U.N. Countries are meant to work together to coordinate a global effort to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. But progress at successive COP summits has been limited. RAUL ESTRADA-OYUELA, KYOTO COP3 CHAIRMAN:  This is a very long process. It will take decades. PAULA DOBRIANSKY, HEAD OF U.S. DELEGATION, BALI, COP13:  We will go forward and join consensus in this today. LEONARDO DICAPRIO, UN MESSENGER OF PEACE: Now must be our moment for action. REPORTER:  The first climate COP summit took place in Berlin in 1995, and representatives from more than states or territories attended. Two years later, progress. The parties at COP3 in Japan agreed to the Kyoto Protocol in which 37 industrialized states or territories were legally bound to start reducing their emissions.  But the biggest polluter at the time the United States refused to ratify the agreement because it didn't oblige developing nations like China to cut emissions. In the following years, climate change slipped on and off the global agenda. After 9/11, the world's attention shifted to fighting international terrorism. Climate issues took a back seat. All the while, greenhouse gas emissions continue to soar and without the United States and China on board, the Kyoto protocol began to crumble, successive climate summits produced few results. COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009 was highly anticipated, but fell short.  BUYELWA SONJICA, SOUTH AFRICAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTER:  It's not acceptable. It's definitely not acceptable. It's disappointing. REPORTER:  Then at COP21 in Paris, there was a breakthrough. In 2015, the Paris agreement was adopted by more than 190 parties, including the U.S. and China, and effectively replaced Kyoto. Its ambition was to limit global warming to well below two, but preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But the watchdog Climate Action Tracker shows that all major economies are off track to meeting their obligations to contain temperature rise and as governments lagged in fulfilling their pledges a new wave of youth-led environmental activism was born. GRETA THUNBERG, CLIMATE ACTIVIST:  All what you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you? DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, before Paris, France. REPORTER:  Then, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris agreement, only for his successor President Biden to bring the U.S. back into it.  JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  This moment demands urgency. Good ideas and good intentions aren't good enough. REPORTER:  At COP26 in Glasgow, developed countries pledged $100 billion annually to support developing countries in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting their economies.  But the conference also had its shortcomings. India successfully demanded that the final agreement would commit countries to phase down rather than phase out coal. JOURNALIST:  It's according to science, sir. It's according to science. BHUPENDER YADAV, INDIAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTER:  No, not at all. REPORTER:  Fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas emit heat trapping greenhouse gas emissions. And if we don't cut those emissions dramatically, scientists predict global temperatures could warm by three degrees by the end of the century. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Now for today's 10 out of 10, we're bringing you a tasty story that's going to wake you up. People deep-fry chicken, they deep-fry potatoes. I've even heard of deep fried Oreos.  But coffee? How to even do that? James Hoffman, a coffee connoisseur and author, deep fried the coffee beans for 14-1/2 minutes. And he says it created a soft and buttery cup of Joe rich but not greasy, I guess you could deep fry just about anything. I think my weakness is French fries. I can eat them all day, every day.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Wonderful Wednesday to you. I know we're just halfway through the week, but we're going to keep on grinding and shining because that's just what we do. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10 and we've got a rendezvous with the news. Yesterday was election day in America. Millions of adults all across the country went to the polls to cast their votes for representatives in Congress, senators and state and local officials. The results were still coming in when we produced this show for the latest info check out CNN.com where results are updated in real time. But between early voting which shattered state records in Georgia and absentee ballots and the sheer volume of votes on election day it could be a while before we know who the winners are all eyes are on the results in Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania, battleground states that Biden flipped to Democratic states in the 2020 presidential election. But now, Republicans are hoping to gain control there. Experts say the 2022 midterm results could foreshadow the 2024 presidential contest. Polls indicate that most voters rank the economy as the number one issue on their minds, but women's rights, guns and public safety as well as immigration and election security are also major issues that are important to voters in this election. Let's hear now from chief national correspondent John King in the election center who explains the early signs he's looking for as election results come in. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Let's start in the House. JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Four hundred thirty-five races in all, under new lines because of the census two years ago, the redistricting process. As you know better than anybody, they're not all competitive. So, what we've done is we've identified working with our partners at inside elections, 82 competitive seats heading into election day. And as you can see, they are coast to coast. Another way to look at it, look at this, just to understand Democrats are on defense. It's a Democratic president's first midterm. It's a tough climate, just look down here at the key to these seats. BASH:  Yeah. KING:  Fifty-seven of the competitive seats have Democratic incumbents almost three times as many, almost three times as many of Republicans. There are three new seats here too as you look at the map. So Democrats are on their heels defending much more territory in a tough year. That's one way to look at it. Now let's bring it up, the big question is, who can get to 2018, right? And in our rankings right now, we already have Republicans favored in seats. Now some of those are just barely favored you see the lighter red on the map. But Republicans have a huge advantage going into election day and if you look down and, you know, the race is very well. These toss-up races go coast to coast. BASH:  Let's look at the Senate. Obviously right now, 50-50. KING:  Right. BASH:  It could go so many different ways. KING:  The chess game here, you can game it out. Reasonably, Democrats winning here, Republicans winning there were elections in all. Again, you work with -- we've worked with our partners here to identify the competitive seats. Eight elections of the Senate, we view as competitive. It could be more. Republicans think they could surprise us in some places of these eight. They're evenly divided now between held by Democrats or held by Republicans. Best way to look at this is to come into the balance of power as you come into the control right now. Again, Democrats enter the election, 50-50. The vice president United States breaks the ties. So Democrats can't afford to lose essentially. And so, you have the states on the map if you come in now to how we rank them, the goal or the toss-up states, one is a Republican held state right now, no incumbent Pennsylvania, Democratic incumbent in Georgia, the probably the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent you were just out there in Nevada. BASH:  Yeah. KING:  This is where the chess gets fascinating. BASH:  Yeah. And so many -- I mean, you're saying that these yellow are maybe the tightest, but that might belie what we're actually seeing on the ground, which is a wider swath of really, really tight races. KING:  But it is possible, again, we know these races are competitive right. But we still tilt New Hampshire Democratic, Republicans think they can pick up that seat. We still tilt Arizona Democratic; Republicans think that one is within their reach. They say watch, we still have -- this as likely Dem up in Washington state, in Colorado, Republicans say keep an eye on everything. So you could -- you conceivably could get Republicans to 52 or 53. You can also get the Democrats to 51 or stay status quo at 50. Again, this race could decide the Senate. In the end, does anybody get above or are we going are we going another month? BASH:  Or are we going to be standing here in December? KING:  On December 6th, but you were just out here. This is what Democrats worry about most. They view Catherine Cortez Masto as the most vulnerable Democrat and again think about the math, right? We won't know that one because it's out west, right? The Democrats would love to pick up Pennsylvania as a safety valve an insurance policy against maybe losing out in Nevada. BASH:  It is going to be a long and very exciting night. KING:  Week. BASH:  Maybe week. John King, thank you. KING:  Thank you. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In what sport would you find a gully, sweeper and a wicket keeper? Curling, bowling, cricket or lacrosse? The answer here is cricket in which the only field are allowed to wear gloves is called the wicket keeper. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Our next story involves the sport of cricket but it's about so much more than the intricacies of the game. It showcases a much broader dynamic of sports and highlights the importance of camaraderie, lifting each other up and setting aside differences to work together towards something greater than ourselves. Steffan Nero is visually impaired. He struggled to fit in, but his life changed when he found his squad, and he's gone on to shatter records. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUBTITLE:  Steffan Nero is not your average athlete. Born with two visual impairments, he struggled at school, failing to find a place where he felt he fitted in. After discovering visually impaired sports, Australian Nero started playing blind cricket and found new horizons. STEFFAN NERO, BLIND CRICKETER:  Sport is for me is such a big part of my life. like I can't really understate it, to be honest. I never really connected with other people my age regarding, you know, just obviously other people who didn't have the same obviously sight condition as me. But I usually felt quite lonely at high in high school. Sport, I would say, really changed my life and really pushed me to realize that I do have a lot of potential. I'd say I've flourished in a way. I became much more confident in myself. Part of a family, you're part of a group, you all dealt with the same experiences. You can speak to each other, and that's something that I really needed when I was growing up, because I think without it I've been a much more -- much different situation without those kinds of experiences. SUBTITLE:  Blind cricket differs from the able-bodied version in a number of ways. Players of varying visual impairments bowl a ball with internal bearings underhanded, allowing it to be heard. Nero etched his name into sporting history when he scored a record-breaking 309 not out innings against New Zealand. NERO:  Once I got the 300-mark, I was just like, okay, this is, you know, I can even make history here. When everyone was clapping as well, it was amazing feeling to experience and something I could say I'll never forget for the rest of my life. Obviously, it wasn't just me, but it was the team and my coaching staff, everyone, my parents, everyone. But still my name was said, Steffan Nero has made 309. So still a very special moment. SUBTITLE:  Although the response was overwhelmingly positive, there were still some negative comments around the record. NERO:  Majority of people obviously very crisp of saying, oh, wow, didn't realize this game that I think it can -- it helps to kind of change people's minds a bit about what disability means as well. I did hear a few comments saying oh you know it's just disability cricket. You know that kind of thing. But like I said a lot of people just making jokes about it as well, which happens, you know, that's the way it is on social media. After a while, I stopped looking at the comments and stuff as well and just kind of just ignored it and said, you know what, this is something that I think is really positive for blind cricket, for people with disabilities in Australia as well. SUBTITLE:  As well as furthering the sport, Nero wants to use his position to inspire the next generation. NERO:  I always say, if you try something, you don't like it, then that's fine. Unless you've tried it, you know, you're taking that first step. It probably will be the hardest thing you ever do, but once it happens and you're involved in that kind of group and that community, I think things get much easier and can be quite a really rewarding experience. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10 story might cause an uproar, and I ain't even lying. The Oklahoma City zoo needs names for its litter of African lion cubs, and it's asking the public to pick 'em. Born September 26 at the zoo's lion overlook habitat, these cute baby lions are the zoo's first in 15 years. Before the cubs are old enough to be put in public display though, they need names. But before you toss out names like Santa Claws (ph), Empe-roar (ph), or Kitty Purrie (ph), you have to cast your vote on a pre-approved name on a list on the zoo's website. Shout out time now. High five and a high 10 to Maclay Middle School in Tallahassee, Florida. Hope you all have a happy day. And remember, happiness isn't some idea that we have to chase or find or create. Happiness is right here, right now, whenever we choose to embrace it. Much love and many blessings. I'm Coy and this is CNN 10. END221110

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. I'm Coy Wire. Here to help you jump-start your week with the best minutes in news right here on CNN 10.  let's start today with an update on the midterm elections. Last week, millions of adults across the country went to the polls to cast their votes for representatives in Congress senators and state and local officials Democrats performed better than predicted. They are projected to retain majority control of the U.S. Senate after winning a pivotal race in Nevada.  Now Democrats will hold 50 Senate seats with Republicans currently holding 49. A December runoff election in the state of Georgia could earn Republicans a matching 50th Senate seat but Democrats would still hold a tie-breaking vote in the Senate which belongs to Vice President Kamala Harris. But the race isn't over yet Republicans may win the House of Representatives as votes continue to be tallied from a handful of districts. If Republicans win the House, they could still stop a significant portion of President Biden's Democratic agenda in his medical proposals. Congress makes nationwide laws. The House decides which laws are voted on, while the Senate can approve or block them and confirm appointments made by the president. Let's hear now from CNN's Jessica Schneider, a justice correspondent based in Washington. She has an update on President Biden's proposal to forgive some student loan debt which would need clear congressional authorization to go through. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  A federal judge out of Texas who is actually nominated by President Trump is now saying President Biden just does not have the power to forgive these student loans by executive order and instead, President Biden would need clear congressional authorization to forgive these loans and he would have had to go through more of a process rather than just simply issuing an executive order.  However, we will see an appeal of this decision. The Justice Department has already noticed that it will appeal and this is ultimately a decision that could be determined by the Supreme Court. Of course, President Biden issued this executive order in August. It's estimated that if it goes through, it would ultimately cost about $400 billion.  The program though now in doubt, and it's also been on hold for the past month because of another court decision out of a circuit court that put the loan forgiveness rollout on hold while all these legal challenges play out.  You know, we know that about 26 million borrowers already have applied for this debt relief. The government had already approved million of those applications, but no debt at all will be canceled for the foreseeable future here because of these court challenges. The White House press secretary did however say that the Department of Education will hold on to the information of all of these applicants so it could be processed pretty quickly if the program is ultimately given the green light in court. But we'll have to see how the courts decide this. If it does go all the way to the Supreme Court, it's possible that the conservative majority on the Supreme Court could nix this program as well. You know this has been a majority that's often skeptical of wide-ranging executive and agency action, so this debt forgiveness program could ultimately. Be deemed unconstitutional and if that happens none of these millions of people would get any debt relief. But for now this program is also on hold. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, a film crew searching the Atlantic Ocean for World War II artifacts unexpectedly swam upon something much more modern, a 20-foot long piece of the Space Shuttle Challenger which exploded shortly after liftoff in 1986. CNN's space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT:  It was the space shuttle's very distinctive heat shield tiles that really gave these divers their first clue that perhaps they had found a piece of NASA's old space shuttle Challenger and you can see in the video these white square tiles that are you know partially covered by sand now in the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean and those white tiles would have been used to protect the underbelly of the space shuttle from the very high temperatures that it would encounter as it re-entered the earth's atmosphere.  So the lead team member on this expedition, the guy by the name of Mike Barnett, he had a friend who was a former NASA astronaut. He showed him this video and that made them convinced that this is indeed what they had found. They brought it to NASA and NASA confirmed it, announcing the findings just this week. And so, the big question now is what does NASA do with this? By law, any piece of a space shuttle is NASA property. So NASA is trying to find a way to do something with this 20-feet section to do something that would really honor the memory of these seven astronauts that were killed back in January of 1986, including Christa McAuliffe who of course would have been the very first teacher in space. Kristin Fisher, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which U.S. government agency measures job market activity and working conditions? Department of Commerce, Department of State, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics? The Bureau of Labor Statistics serves as the statistical resource for the U.S. Department of Labor. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  For the past year, the job market has been strong. In October, the economy created 261,000 new jobs. But things may not quite be what they seem. Job hires dropped to a low not seen in more than a year and a half.  We'll hear now from CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich who's finding out why getting a job might not be as easy as some might think, and how some people are getting creative to get noticed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARLY PAVLINAC, JOB SEEKER:  I'm open to all options. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Karly Pavlinac is on stage in a high-stakes competition. The potential prize: a new job. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How do you make sure you're working with the right talent, you're finding the right connections? PAVLINAC:  The biggest thing is just being able to communicate the idea. YURKEVICH:  This is not the first time Pavlinac has done something unconventional to land an interview, since losing her marketing job in September. After she didn't hear back for a position at Nike, she sent them a cake with her resume on it.  PAVLINAC:  I've been applying obviously that hasn't worked yet, so let me throw something new in the mix and see if that you know works. YURKEVICH:  Her resume cake making headlines.  PAVLINAC:  I've since talked to a bunch of people at Nike but still no job. YURKEVICH:  But the economic data tells a different story. The jobs market is strong. There are 10.7 million open positions, labor shortages and hundreds of thousands of jobs being added each month.  Yet some job seekers even with a viral cake moment can't seem to land one. LIZ ANN SONDERS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST:  On the surface, this is still fairly strong labor market. But if you go a couple of layers under, you are starting to see more significant cracks in the surface that suggest we should eventually see it in those more popular headline type labor market readings. YURKEVICH:  Cracks like a slowdown in hiring, as seen in this week's job opening survey. Hires dropping to 6.1 million, the lowest since February 2021, and the tech industry is shutting jobs percent more than last year.  PAVLINAC:  My perception of the job market was there were a ton of jobs out there and it was going to be easy to find a job, and that actually hasn't been the case. YURKEVICH:  Another crack of the 10.7 million open jobs, some companies might be advertising positions they aren't actively trying to fill. PAVLINAC:  I have applied to many jobs that they're still sitting there, that's been a giant question in my head.  YURKEVICH:  It's called pipelining talent. Companies post jobs to develop a pool of candidates. Recruiter Laura Mazzullo says she sees companies do it all the time. LAURA MAZZULLO, FOUNDER, EAST SIDE STAFFING:  Candidates don't know that's what's happening. So they're being pipelined when actually they think they're applying for an active job and this is where we're seeing a bit of a disconnect.  YURKEVICH:  That may mean as the labor market weakens, job seekers can't be as picky. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our goal is potentially to give away two jobs tonight. PAVLINAC:  I have been picking in that sense of where I want to work but I know what I want. I'm still searching, still talking to people. I've come to terms that it is taking longer than I thought. YURKEVICH:  Vanessa Yurkevich, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10 is from Minnesota man James Rasmussen as we head into the holiday season. He's hoping to avoid the terra bowel experience he had last season. He couldn't figure out who-who was cutting his outdoor Christmas lights. Turns out it was the owl who stole Christmas, using the lights to deck its own halls, its nest under Rasmussen's deck. Critters, there's no talon what they'll do. Better luck nest time Mr. Rasmussen. Without further owl do, a special shout out now to Ryan Middle in Fairbanks, Alaska. Wishing you and everyone watching around the world some motivation this Monday.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy. Grateful to be spending part of my day with you right here on CNN 10. We have a great show today, so let's get to it. We're going to begin with the news out of Bali where the G20 Summit is taking place. The global 20 is an intergovernmental forum between countries that addresses major issues related to the global economy. President Joe Biden held a three-hour talk Monday with the president of China, Xi Jinping. The meeting was their first in-person encounter since President Biden took office and an opportunity for both countries to improve deteriorating relations. Dialogue between them hit a new low in August when U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, a choice that upset China. Expectations for major change were low headed into the meeting. The White House said in a statement afterwards that President Biden raised concerns about China's human rights violations, but that the two countries found areas of agreement especially when it came to the war in Ukraine. In addition, the two nations promised to work together on global climate issues, world health and food security, and they pledge to keep communication open. But at the heart of the U.S.-Chinese relations is the Taiwan question. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Will Ripley in Taipei. The capital of ROC, the Republic of China, commonly known as Taiwan. This island is a vibrant democracy of $23 million people and a key ally of the United States, about 100 miles from mainland China. SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  And I'm Selina Wang in Beijing the capital of China, officially called the People's Republic of China. The PRC was founded in by the victorious Communist Party after a bloody civil war. RIPLEY:  On the losing side, the nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek who had ruled since the 1920s, they fled here to Taiwan where the ROC flag still flies today. Two sides both claiming control of one country, a decades-long dispute, halting travel and trade and leaving a lingering threat of war. WANG:  Initially, both the United States and the United Nations recognized Taipei as the seat of the Chinese government. But amid the shifting political relations at the height of the Cold War, that changed in the 1970s. The PRC replaced the ROC at the U.N. and the United States changed diplomatic relations. It moved its embassy from Taipei to here in Beijing. While the U.S. has adopted a so-called one China policy, it has never recognized the communist party sovereign claim over Taiwan. Washington continues to sell weapons to Taipei, but it has remained deliberately unclear about whether it would come to Taiwan's defense in the event of a Chinese invasion. It keeps Beijing guessing. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You know, you hear people saying Biden wants to start a new Cold War with China. I don't want a cold war with China. I just want to make China understand that we are not going to step back. We are not going to change any of our views. RIPLEY:  That looming threat of invasion is only part of China's ongoing campaign to squeeze Taiwan. Decades of diplomatic pressure by Beijing means this island has very few formal diplomatic allies, because any nation that wants to normalize relations with China has to sever formal diplomatic ties with Taipei. The island's Olympic team can't even carry the Taiwanese flag. They have to compete under the name Chinese Taipei. In Singapore, in 1992, the two sides did agree at least in theory to the existence of one China. WANG:  It's impossible to overstate just how important Taiwan is to the ruling communist party and its legitimacy. China sees the self-ruled island as a breakaway province that must be reunified with the mainland, even by force if necessary. Reunification is also rooted in the communist party's goal to reverse China's century of humiliation by colonial powers. That means returning China's borders to something more like that of the Qing Empire. It's the basis of modern China's claims to Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong and Taiwan. RIPLEY:  Putting sovereignty on the back burner gave Taiwan's economy a boost. Cross strait trade, tourism and money moving again. In 2015, the ruling parties on both sides met again in Singapore, a historic summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Taiwan's then President Ma Ying-jeou. One year later, a turning point. Taiwan's 2016 election of Tsai Ing-wen, the island's first female president, leading a longtime pro-independence party. Tensions rising ever since, something Taiwan blames on China's plan to push its power across the Indo-Pacific. Taiwan's young democracy divided on the issue of unification with the mainland. The tide is turning. In 2020, Tsai won a landslide re-election, vowing to defend Taiwan's democracy from she's increasingly powerful and authoritarian China. Cross strait ties plunging to their lowest level in decades. TSAI ING-WEN, PRESIDENT OF TAIWAN (translated):  The broadest consensus among the Taiwanese people and our various political parties is that we must defend our national sovereignty, our free and democratic way of life. On this point, we have no room for compromise. WANG:  With U.S.-China tensions at an all-time high, Washington and Taipei have moved closer. In 2016, then U.S. President-elect Donald Trump broke a decade-long precedent and spoke to President Tsai on the phone. He also elevated official exchanges between Washington and Taipei, a move that infuriated Beijing. RIPLEY:  China's refusal to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine has many here asking, what is Beijing planning for Taiwan, testing the island's defenses, flying scores of warplanes near the island, making President Xi's long-standing calls for peaceful reunification ring hollow? REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  We will not allow China to isolate Taiwan. RIPLEY:  In August 2022, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi became the highest ranking U.S. lawmaker to visit this island in 25 years, a move Beijing call a major political provocation. In response, China launched military exercises beyond the median line encircling the island. During her visit, Pelosi delivered the unequivocal message that America stands with Taiwan. But if the time comes, would the U.S. send in American troops to defend this Chinese-speaking democracy, a democracy with an uncertain future? (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: When compared to Earth, the atmosphere of Mars is? Thinner, thicker, or about the same? The atmosphere of Mars is over 100 times thinner than Earth. And actually, that thin atmosphere on Mars presents challenges for NASA. (END VIDEO CLIP) A new initiative from NASA called LOFTID could be a potential solution and will determine if a giant inflatable shield could protect spacecrafts against the heat of re-entering the atmosphere. The shield can withstand 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit and at feet in diameter, it's also the largest blunt object ever to return from space. The technology would help spacecrafts enter Mars's thin atmosphere because the Martian atmosphere can't decelerate a spacecraft as quickly and coolly as Earth's atmosphere. And we're ending today's show with a bang for 10 out of 10. Check out this massive explosion in western Kentucky. Drop them like it's hot. These three structures are actually cooling towers at a closed coal plant. The towers were 435 feet tall until they weren't. Tennessee Valley Authorities said the blast was done on purpose to clear the land for future use. The dramatic footage shows the towers slowly collapsing to the ground with clouds of dust all around. The Drakesboro, Kentucky, plant was active for nearly 60 years before effectively closing in 2020. And now to my favorite part of the day, I want to give a special shout out to Crown Point High School in Crown Point, Indiana. Go Bulldogs! Thank you so much for watching.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, everyone? It's Wednesday. Are you hanging in there? Let's smell the flowers and cool the soup.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10.  Just a few more days and we are on the Thanksgiving break. So let's rock. We're going to start today though with news out of India, where air quality is an ongoing issue.  New Delhi, India, is the world's most polluted capital according to IQAir, a Swiss company that measures air quality. It's blanketed in smog every winter as the cold air traps dust in the atmosphere above the city.  In March of this year, firefighters battled ablaze in New Delhi at a landfill site. The fire cloaked the area in a toxic haze and smoke choked residents for days. Factories, construction sites and primary schools were ordered to shut down, and Delhi authorities urged people to work from home. There's currently a debate in India over how to handle waste. There's no processing of waste in most Indian cities, according to the government's central pollution board and in some cases trash is simply burned in open dump yards on the roads. Delhi's 24-hour air quality index measures the concentration of harmful pollutants. Anything over 300 is considered hazardous and New Delhi's levels are as high as 470. The government is attempting to take stricter measures to tackle air quality as there are major health concerns for citizens in India.  We'll hear more now from Vedika Sud, a CNN reporter based at the New Delhi bureau who will introduce us to some of the people impacted by the poor air quality and explain the science behind the toxic air. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  Seventy-two-year-old shopkeeper Narayan Choudhary suffers from chronic asthma. He says he almost died in April this year after the landfill behind his house which is the size of a village caught fire.  NARAYAN CHOUDHARY, SHOPKEEPER (through translator):  It was a massive blade. It was difficult to survive. My face and nose started swelling. I was gasping for breath. I could barely drink or eat. SUD:  Choudhary says had it not been for his friend who rushed him to hospital, he wouldn't be here today. It was a dangerous combination of methane, unsegregated garbage and record high temperatures earlier this year that sparked massive fires not only at the Bhalswa landfill but also here at one of Asia's biggest dump sites. Government data from 2019 says this Ghazipur landfill is almost stories tall and the size of s soccer fields. Methane is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas and one company GHGSat found on a single day in March as trash decomposed more than two metric tons of methane gas leaked every hour from the Ghazipur landfill. STEPHANE GERMAIN, CEO, GHGSAT:  When we take all the measurements that we took over a period of about a year, we found that the total emissions were equivalent to emissions from approximately 350,000 U.S. passenger vehicles per year. SUD:  And methane emissions aren't the only hazard. Dangerous toxins from landfills seep into the ground polluting the water supply for thousands of residents living nearby. That's the color of the water, a pale, dirty yellow and we're barely hundred meters away from the foothill of the landfill. In May, CNN commissioned two accredited labs to test the groundwater around the Bhalswa landfill. The result, the groundwater within at least a 500-  meter radius around the wayside is contaminated. According to the labs, it's unfit for drinking.  In the first lab report, the total dissolves solids from all three samples were off the charts. Amid other parameters, levels of ammonia and sulfate was significantly higher than acceptable limits mandated by the Indian government. Results from the second lab report were equally worrying. Also iron traces in the first sample for both lab reports were at least eight times more than the permissible limit. And while authorities bring in a supply of clean water, residents say they're simply not enough for this densely populated neighborhood, and that they must buy and consume purified water.  As part of his Clean India Initiative, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said efforts are being made to remove these mountains of garbage and convert them into green zones. That goal if achieved could stem the suffering of those residents living in the shadows of these dump sites and go a long way to curb the massive amounts of methane being released into the atmosphere.  With more than 3,100 landfills, the task is monumental and so far unrealized. And if decisive action isn't taken soon, the consequences on the global climate fight could be catastrophic and the toll on human life unimaginable. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In what U.S. city would you find the famous museum complex nickname "the nation's attic"? New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles or Raleigh? The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. is home to 19 museums, 21 libraries and is home to over 154 million eclectic holdings. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Up next, we're traveling to Raleigh, North Carolina, to show you how big tech is making that city one of the fastest growing in the United States. Raleigh even gained the recognition as the Smithsonian of the South because of its booming art scene and all the free museums you can choose from. Let's check it out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  If you were to list the great art and educational centers of the U.S., you might think of New York or D.C. But you might be missing one, here, Raleigh, North Carolina. Raleigh has long been a museum Mecca with a vibrant art scene. Now, big companies like Google and Apple are moving into the area, helping to make it one of the fastest growing cities in the U.S. And as the city's grown, Raleigh has gained more recognition as a cultural destination. The area boasts more than locally owned art galleries, over 60 performing art spaces, and 140 pieces of public art in the downtown area, not to mention over 50 historic sites and 17 museums, most of which are free, leading some people to call Raleigh and its abundance of cultural institutions the Smithsonian of the south. VALERIE HILLINGS, DIRECTOR AND CEO, NORTH CAROLINA MUSEUM OF ART:  The state of North Carolina from the 20th century realized what an important thing it was to offer to its citizens free museums, giving everyone an opportunity to learn about and experience different subjects. We opened our doors in 1956. REPORTER:  The North Carolina museum of arts collection stretches across different cultures and eras. It has dedicated galleries to Rodin, Jewish ceremonial art. It even has an infinity mirror room sculpture by Yayoi Kusama, who has been nicknamed the most Instagramed artist in the world. HILLINGS:  As I like to say, all art is once contemporary and all art becomes history. We began to move single artworks around into other galleries, unexpected galleries, that really changed how people saw this collection. One of the Wileys has been a real fan favorite as it's been paired with an earlier portrait of King Louis showing two young men having a great sense of swagger., REPORTER:  The museum also has the largest connected art park in the country, at a whopping 164 acres. HILLINGS:  It becomes like an outdoor art gallery. REPORTER:  The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences is the largest of its kind in the Southeast and home to millions of plants animals gems and to the second biggest earth on Earth. CHRIS SMITH, COORDINATOR OF CURRENT SCIENCE PROGRAMS, NC MUSEUM OF NATURALK SCIENCES:  It's accurate down to the most minute detail. There's a lot of great ways to get close to nature here at the museum and a lot of great ways to learn about what's going on in the state of North Carolina.  One of the main highlights, the reasons to come visit are the whale skeletons. That whale the Smithsonian tried to take it and we were like no, we want it. These are dinosaurs that would have lived in prehistoric North Carolina. This is an eastern glass lizard and very active this morning good to see him out. There are 50 states, North Carolina is the best because North Carolina has a little bit of everything that everybody loves. REPORTER:  Whether you're interested in history, modern art or even Harley- Davidson drag racing, Raleigh's got you covered. HILLINGS:  Many of the things you can see not only in New York but at museums worldwide, you can see here in North Carolina. But also you can see things you won't see anywhere else.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANNOUNCER:  Five, four, stage engine start, three, two, one -- booster's ignition and liftoff of Artemis I. We rise together back to the moon and beyond. (END VIDEO CLIP) COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Happy Thursday, everyone, or as I like to say happy Friday eve. I'm Coy. Thankful to be hanging out with you. Time for the best 10 minutes in news right here on CNN 10. Let's rise together. We start today with the liftoff of the rocket we just saw. Yesterday, NASA launching its long-awaited Artemis moon rocket. The mission was a long time and a lot of money coming. NASA has spent more than billion dollars to date getting Artemis off the ground. But there were scrubbed launches hurricanes and mechanical issues that delayed takeoff for months. But the rocket finally got off the ground. This mission kicks off a key test of America's ability to send astronauts back to the moon. Can you believe the last time humans were on the moon was way back in 1972? That's 50 years ago. But hold on a moon-it, there won't be any humans on the moon just yet. There's no crew for this expedition. The rocket will come within 60 miles of the lunar surface before flying forty thousand miles beyond the moon and then looping back to Earth over three weeks' time. The journey will conclude with a splash when the rocket lands at sea on December 11th. We're going to hear now from CNN's space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher about the first test flight of the Artemis moon rocket. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT:  This is, of course, an uncrewed first test flight for the Artemis moon rocket. It is a SLS rocket, the space launch system rocket, with the Orion crew capsule on top. And so, what we've seen over the last few hours is launch and then the capsule separating from the rocket, and the rocket falling back to earth. And now, this little capsule, the Orion capsule, is now making its way to the moon. It's going to take about five or six days to get there. When it gets there, it's going to fly by very close to the moon just about feet off the lunar surface before then traveling farther out into space than any spacecraft ever designed to carry humans has ever flown, before flying back to earth testing out that all-important heat shield at the base of the Orion capsule before splashing down into the ocean. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia, Thanksgiving themed. What type of food was definitely not present in 1600s New England when Pilgrims first arrived? Cranberries, pumpkin, potatoes or corn? Potatoes which are native to South America hadn't been introduced to North America yet. They weren't established crops there until the 1700s. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Officially, one week away from Thanksgiving now. What's your favorite thanksgiving side dish mashed potatoes cream corn cornbread or stuffing or dressing as some folks like to call it? Whatever you love, be sure to really love and appreciate it this Thanksgiving. Because due to inflation, Thanksgiving dinner will cost 20 percent more this year than last, and that was already considered the most expensive Thanksgiving ever. We'll hear now from chief business correspondent Christine Romans on what you and your families can expect at the grocery store this holiday season. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  On the menu this year for Thanksgiving, rising prices. Overall, prices are up 7.7 percent from last year and grocery prices are more than 12 percent higher than a year ago. Here's what it means for the family grocery bill as you shop for the big day. First, the turkey. Per pound prices for turkey are up 17 percent year-  over-year. An average frozen turkey costs roughly $2.38 cents a pound. That's up from a $1.74. Now you can blame the avian flu outbreaks and hire fuel feed and labor costs because of inflation running near 40-year highs. What about eggs? Eggs cost 43 percent more than a year ago. Butter and margarine are up 33 percent. Flour is up nearly 25 percent. Your pies are going to cost more to make. These higher prices could potentially change Thanksgiving plans. A new Wells Fargo report suggests some Americans may opt to eat out rather than shop and cook at home this year. Dining out also can be cost the report says, but it may be a better value than one might expect. Government data backs that up year over year the cost of dining out rose at a slower pace than the cost of a typical grocery store run. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Speaking of Thanksgiving grubbing, one of the best parts is eating leftovers in my opinion like for days and days, right? But we all know some people get skeezed out by that. Did you know though that the United States wastes 108 billion pounds of food each year? Well, maybe it doesn't have to be like that. CNN reported on the science behind food storage with expert tips on how to best store your food and to keep your leftovers from going bad. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  The kitchen is the heart of our homes and fortress for our fresh food. Taking pride of place, these gleaming apples and bananas might look safe now, but when you open the fridge or cupboards a few days later, you can find your once fresh ingredients in a very different condition. And this often comes down to how you put them away in the first place. BRITTANY TOWERS LEWIS, FOOD SCIENTIST:  A lot of food is wasted. People buy in bulk and then end up not eating it. REPORTER:  So much food in fact that if food loss and waste were a country it would be the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases. To keep food for longer and help the planet and your household budget in the process, there are a few things to keep in mind. LEWIS:  One is time. So obviously the longer you keep something, it will eventually go bad. Oxygen, there's a lot of reactions that happen if you've heard of oxidation. That kind of causes apples to go brown, for example when you cut them. Moisture can increase microbial growth, which is something that we want to prevent because obviously bacteria, molds, light can also cause foods to spoil a little faster. Like potatoes, they're exposed to light. They can turn green. They produce sprouts for example. REPORTER:  So, to avoid waking up to potatoes like this, you should keep them in a cool dark place, in a breathable bag to avoid moisture, and away from fruits such as bananas. This is because bananas are climacteric foods which means they produce a lot of ethylene. LEWIS:  Ethylene, very fancy term. It's a gas that causes fruits and vegetables to ripen. That's why a lot of times when people are like, hey, you want to ripen something put it in a bag with a banana, because bananas produce a lot of ethylene. So, it'll cause it to ripen faster. REPORTER:  Salad leaves are another victim of bad storage, resulting in this all too familiar kitchen scene. LEWIS:  If you notice kind of your leaves aren't lasting as long a really great way is to rinse them off and make sure they're completely dry. Vinegar not only will help kill or monitor bacteria but it's also very acidic. So, most bacteria also don't like acidic environments. REPORTER:  And remember the role moisture plays. LEWIS:  Bacteria love water and that's what they use to grow. So, the more water you try to take out, the longer that they last. So, if you put a little paper towel in, keep it in your refrigerator, that will help keep the lettuce a little longer. REPORTER:  But when it comes to herbs, a little H20 used correctly goes a long way. LEWIS:  If you cut the bottom stem part off and kind of put them in some water, in your refrigerator, that can help keep them a little longer. They're like a living plant. So, they're in their little water and they're drinking it up, instead of in like a bag from the grocery store that kind of just like harbors just bacteria because everything's like stuck together. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10 is fantastic. Scientists discovering never seen before deep sea creatures at the bottom of the Indian Ocean near the Cocos Islands, an Australian territory. These fish are freaky. There's a deep-sea batfish looking like a baby Yoda thingy. And then this previously unknown species of blind eel. I mean, it makes me wonder what else could be down there or do we even want to know? All right. All my so-fish-ticated folks, it's about that time. I want to give a special shout-out to Marianna High School in Marianna, Florida. We see you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. We made it to the weekend. Friday's rock especially when they lead into a nice long holiday vacation. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and we are pumped to be right here with you to finish this week strong. We're starting today by concluding our months-long coverage of the midterm elections. Let's reflect. On November 8th, Americans cast their votes for representatives in Congress which consists of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, and they also voted for candidates for state and local offices. The elections are called midterms because they happen in the middle of a president's four-year term. After a close race and days of counting ballots Democrats retained the Senate, while Republicans won the House of Representatives. This means Republicans can stop a significant portion of President Biden's Democratic agenda. Remember, Congress makes nationwide laws. The House decides which laws are voted on. The Senate can approve or block them and confirm appointments made by the president. The candidates who won their position will take office this January so we won't see any changes until then. Pretty soon, the next batch of candidates will start campaigning for the elections in 2024 where the big race will be for president of the United States. We'll be here through the whole process updating you on the latest with no opinion or slant, just the facts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What country will host the 2022 World Cup? Japan, France, Qatar or Australia? The Middle Eastern nation of Qatar will host the 2022 international soccer tournament which kicks off on Sunday. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  The World Cup, it's one of the most popular sporting events of all time. Every four years, the best players from across the planet represent their nations in an epic soccer tournament. The world cup kicking off this Sunday in Qatar is the men's tournament. The women's is next year, and more than one million people are expected to travel to Qatar. That's more than a third of the nation's entire population. This year's tourney has been described though as the "World Cup of chaos". For the first time ever, it's not being played in the traditional summer months because for the first time ever, it's in the Middle East where the Qatari desert would have been scorching hot during that time. So, players in top leagues across the world are having to play this World Cup in the middle of their club seasons, meaning they'll be exhausted. Also, the country of Qatar has been criticized for its human rights record. More now from CNN anchor and correspondent Isa Soares. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEPP BLATTER, FORMER FIFA PRESIDENT:  The winner to organize the 2022 FIFA World Cup is Qatar. ISA SOARES, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The sports world was stunned when FIFA awarded the World Cup to Qatar. Controversy took center stage and football risked becoming a sideshow. Why was Qatar, a tiny desert state with no football pedigree, chosen to host FIFA's showpiece event? Even the disgraced former chief of football's governing body has since described the decision as a mistake. BLATTER:  I was right at a certain time to say it is -- we should not go there. SOARES:  That move, 12 years ago, provoked unprecedented anger, accusations of corruption, and sportswashing. Qatari officials strongly denied the allegation that bribery was involved in their bid. Before a ball is kicked at the year's tournament, attention has focused on Qatar's human rights record. Its stance on same-sex relationship, and most damaging to its reputation, the treatment of overseas workers drafted in to build essential infrastructure. Amnesty International claims authorities failed to properly investigate the deaths of thousands of migrant workers despite evidence linking premature deaths with unsafe working conditions in the searing heat. Qatari officials say they investigate all reports of abuse and exploitation and are committed to holding unscrupulous employers to account. When the final whistle goes at Qatar 2022, the legacy will be judged not only over 28 days of football but in the years that lie ahead. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, this is a sad and uncertain time for many people across the tech industry. Many workers are scrambling to seek new opportunities. Fears of recession, rising interest rates and a shift to pre-pandemic lifestyles have all dealt major blows to the tech industry. More than 35,000 tech workers across 72 companies have been laid off just this month, for a total of 120,000 tech jobs lost this year. We'll hear now from CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich who has more on the future of the industry. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In three weeks, the tech industry lost tens of thousands of jobs. Historic layoffs at Twitter, Meta, Lyft and Amazon. Layoffs.fyi, a crowdsourced layoff tracking site, puts it at more than 35,000 layoffs so far this month. ROGER LEE, FOUNDER, LAYOFFS.FYI:  That's the highest month since the pandemic. So that beats April 2020, which was 17,000 employees laid off. YURKEVICH:  Meta cut its workforce by 13 percent. CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying he's taking accountability and apologizing to those impacted. New owner Elon Musk slashed half of Twitter staff with founder Jack Dorsey tweeting: The company grew too quickly, I apologize for that. And Amazon is laying off ten thousand workers this week, citing an unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment. NELA RICHARDSON, CHIEF ECONOMIS, ADP RESEARCH INSTITUTE:  There were big investments made during the pandemic time while the rest of the economy for example was plummeting by 3.4 percent. Tech grew by four percent. YURKEVICH:  But in a post-pandemic high inflation world, consumer behaviors and spending habits are changing, with the threat of recession on the horizon. RICHARDSON:  I take this as a sign that maybe companies got over their skis at some point right and they're trying to kind of sit upright again. YURKEVICH:  Roger Lee founded layoffs.fyi as the pandemic unfolded. Recently, he's been digging deeper into the numbers. LEE:  There have been many companies who have been letting go half or more of their recruiting HR teams just because they're not hiring as many people anymore. YURKEVICH:  Aaron Backman, a recruiter at a tech company, was one of those layoffs. What did that feel like for you? AARON BACKMAN, LAID OFF FROM TECH COMPANY:  It was a really awful feeling. We were told really early in the morning an email saying layoffs are coming today. And if you get a call, it's going to be you. And I sat there for six hours on slack and watched my colleagues get laid off one by one. YURKEVICH:  Then he got the call. BACKMAN:  It's depressing. YURKEVICH:  As American workers watch tech giants shed jobs at a rapid clip, many in other industries are asking, am I next? Should they be nervous? RICHARDSON:  First of all, the tech economy are just two percent of the labor market. Tech is an important part of the economy but it is not the whole of the economy. The rest of the labor market is looking pretty good. The economy is adding jobs at a pretty healthy clip. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's out 10 of 10 is quite relephant to what we do here at CNN 10.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, everyone?  Hope you had an awesome break and had some time to reflect on the things for which you are thankful, something for which I'm grateful is all of you and I am pumped to be right back at it so we can finish 2022 strong together, just 34 days remain in this year. We start today with news out of China. Protests have erupted all across the country, citizens taking to the streets in an unprecedented challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping's zero COVID policy. Hundreds of people in China shouting the phrases "Step down, Xi Jinping. Step down, communist party", and "Don't want COVID test, want freedom". The Chinese government has faced mounting anger at its zero COVID policy which attempts to isolate every case of COVID in the country and shut down the surrounding areas. Even almost three years into the pandemic, COVID tests, incessant lockdowns and quarantines have plagued the country. The protocols have kept China's infection rate lower than countries like the United States. The government, though, faces complaints about the economic and human cost as citizens are isolated for weeks at a time with limited access to food and medicine, while the country suffers economically.  A deadly fired an apartment block in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, killed 10 people and injured nine more on Thursday. After the event video suggested that COVID lockdown measures delayed firefighters from reaching the victims. The incident has been a further catalyst to the widespread anger and defiance against the government, which is rarely seen in China, a country where the communist party cracks down on all dissent. We'll hear more now from CNN international correspondent Selina Wang based at the network's Beijing bureau with more on this movement. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Anger is rising and tragedies are mounting but China shows no sign of budging on zero COVID. Authorities are clamping down with more lockdowns, mass testing and quarantine, and people are getting more and more frustrated. Adding to the anger is a fire that broke out in the capital of China's far west Xinjiang region on Thursday night. Ten people were killed and nine were injured in a fire at an apartment building in Urumqi.  Most parts of Xinjiang have been under lockdown for more than a hundred days. The deadly fire sparked nationwide outrage because widely circulated videos which have now been censored in China show that COVID measures, COVID lockdown measures very likely delayed firefighters from getting to the scene.  Now, state media claims that people in the compound were allowed to leave the building, that it was considered a low-risk COVID area. But video shows fire trucks unable to get close to the scene because the compound entrance was partially blocked. The video shows it's blocked with fences tents and metal barriers that are normally used as part of COVID measures.  The videos also show smoke and flames coming from a high floor of the building but the water failing to actually reach the fire. What adds to the tragedy is that those who died in the fire likely spent their last three months largely confined to that building if not entirely.  The fire really struck a cord with the public here because we've seen scenes of tragedy and suffering play out over and over again since the start of the pandemic. Countless stories of people struggling to get enough food daily necessities and emergency care and lockdown three years into these draconian policies, frustrations are more frequently turning into public protests which are normally rare and authoritarian China.  Last week, in the southern city of Guangzhou, some residents revolted during lockdown by tearing down barriers and marching through the streets. There were violent clashes at the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou this week. But still, there's no end in sight to zero COVID. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What type of star is the sun? Yellow Dwarf, Neutron Star, Red Dwarf, or Supernova? According to NASA, the sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old Yellow Dwarf star, at the center of our solar system. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next up, we'll hear how Heliogen, a renewable energy company in California's Mojave Desert, is using concentrated sunlight to power more than just your home. This new tech startup wants to replace fossil fuels with concentrated sunlight. But unlike traditional green energy suppliers, this startup is able to store fuel to create power even when it's dark outside or cloudy.  But while the company has major financial backers, it's not a perfect solution. Stock prices are low and some question whether Heliogen can execute on a large scale. We'll hear now from CNN business producer Jon Sarlin. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JON SARLIN, CNN BUSINESS PRODUCER (voice-over):  In California's Mojave Desert, renewable energy company Heliogen is working to harness concentrated sunlight for more than just powering your home. Using artificial intelligence, these mirrors can produce the extremely high temperatures needed to make things like concrete, steel and green hydrogen. So behind you are these mirrors reflecting light. Tell me what they're -- what are they doing? BILL GROSS, FOUNDER AND CEO, HELIOGEN:  We're taking a field of mirrors. Each one of them being moved precisely by computer algorithms to reflect the sunlight to a single spot up on the tower behind us. At that single spot, we're achieving temperatures that are almost a third the temperature of the surface of the sun.  SARLIN:  What do you turn what these mirrors are projecting into? GROSS:  The end result is we get very high temperatures so we can make steam for heavy industry, we can melt aluminum, we can melt steel, we can make concrete.  SARLIN:  It's the algorithm that separates Heliogen from other concentrated solar power ventures. Heliogen doesn't need complex mirrors. Instead, they use cameras and computing power to align their mirrors to reflect sunlight onto a refinery tower. This process creates temperatures of about a thousand degrees Celsius and all of that heat is directed and stored in big thermos-like containers. GROSS:  So the energy continues after the sun goes down or even on cloudy days. We hold enough energy for a week of no sunshine, so that industry can run 24/7.  SARLIN:  Concentrated solar power is a renewable energy resource that's been around for decades to generate power, but with mixed success. Its primary disadvantage has always been the hours of the day the sun isn't shining.  Heliogen's process solves this problem by storing its heat and making green fuel like hydrogen that can be used to fuel electric generating stations. Okay. So you have this concentrated light source. You're using it for power, for industrial uses, and for what else? GROSS:  Because we have continuous electricity. We can make hydrogen. So hydrogen is a miracle substance. It's the most common element on earth.  SARLIN:  Heliogen is using the thermal energy it creates to make hydrogen. Ironically, most hydrogen is made using fossil fuels, which has limited its production. What Heliogen is doing is making the process of creating a clean fuel clean. GROSS:  We already moved a molecule all over the earth in the form of oil and gas. Hydrogen is also a molecule which we can transport. So why is that so important? The United States can be an energy exporter, a renewable energy exporter. SARLIN:  So are we there yet? GROSS:  We're there. This is happening. Where we really need hydrogen is for trucks, for airplanes, for long distance transportation. All the places where hydrogen is made right now in a dirty way, we're going to make it in a clean way.  SARLIN:  So the question though is if we can do it, we can do it in the lab. But can we do it on scale? GROSS:  We are doing it at scale. That's what you're looking at here. SARLIN:  At scale? GROSS:  At scale. This is a scale technology with a multi-acre field gathering the sunlight from multiple acres, concentrating it, and using that high temperature energy to split water and make hydrogen. SARLIN:  The company has major backers like Bill Gates. But still, Heliogen has faced obstacles. Your stock price has faltered over the last year. Is the business at where you want it to be? GROSS:  Absolutely. In all businesses, your timing has to be perfect. So what's happened in the last year or so that makes the timing perfect? Well, fossil fuel prices have tripled. So all of a sudden, you can go to business and say, I'm going to install a system for you that takes away the volatility, you'll have control over your own energy production and I'm going to meet or beat your price and with zero emissions.  The sun is a resource that no one owns. It gives us ten thousand times more energy than the whole humanity needs and it's available for everybody. So the innovation can happen everywhere.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. And we've got a rendezvous with the news, so let's go. We're going to begin with news on the economy regarding the most wonderful time of the year, the holiday season, traditionally a big season for shopping as well. This year, many shoppers are returning to their pre- pandemic routines, going back nearly three years now. Shoppers are expected to shop big around some key dates like Black Friday last week, but they're also predicted to make major purchases later in the shopping season, hoping to land deals.  This year, inflation has limited many shoppers budgets though. But retailer experts say that customers are pulling back on discretionary spending like furniture and electronics and are being more selective about what they buy. Many Americans are dipping into their savings accounts and racking up debt to make purchases as well. They're also utilizing services like buy now pay later, which is a type of installment loan people might use instead of a traditional credit card. Let's break it down by the numbers. Online, Black Friday sales in the United States topped a record-breaking $9 billion this year, and were over two percent higher compared to last year. U.S. shoppers spent a record $5.29 billion on Thanksgiving Day, up nearly 3 percent from a year ago.  Experts are predicting that American shoppers spent more than $9.5 billion across Saturday and Sunday, and that Monday will be the biggest online shopping day again, growing more than five percent from last year to $11 billion. But some of that growth reflects higher prices, not necessarily higher volume, due to inflation this year. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSIENESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  On this year's holiday shopping menu, more sales but with a healthy side of inflation. DENISE SALLETTE, HOLIDAY SHOPPER:  Cutting off your circulation. I'm going crazy. YURKEVICH:  Denise Sallette is in the middle of her holiday shopping at Willowbrook Mall in Wayne, New Jersey.  SALLETTE:  This is for my mom. And then I got stuff for my kids and my niece and, oh my God.  YURKEVICH:  This year, the wish list is looking a little different. Last month, inflation cooled but was still running hot at 7.7 percent year-over-  year. SALLETTE:  I've had a cutback on shopping because things are too expensive. I mean, I do have three girls. They do understand that, you know, times are hard right now and it's just me being a single mom. YURKEVICH:  Despite high inflation, the National Retail Federation estimates that nearly 8 million more people will shop between Black Friday and Cyber Monday and spend up to eight percent more this year than they did last year. MATTHEW SHAY, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL RETAIL FEDERATION:  We're looking at records in all categories. It is remarkable in the face of the cost and the price pressures that consumers are still finding a way to increase their spending power the economy, drive economic activity. YURKEVICH:  Last month, retail sales beat expectations, up 1.3 percent in October. But this month, consumer sentiment fell. Still, higher prices haven't stopped some people from shopping. Has that impacted the way you're going to spend this holiday season? CYNTHIA PENDELTON, HOLIDAY SHOPPER: For me, not really because I try not to overspend anyways. So even before this is going on, I try not to exceed what I can do.  YURKEVICH:  And according to the National Retail Federation, while online sales are expected to increase this year, a return to in-store shopping will make up a larger portion of all holiday sales. PENDELTON:  I kind of like in person more. YURKEVICH:  You do wise up. PENDELTON:  I don't know. It's just more of the feel of being able to touch it, being able to see it, being able to try it on for the stores that you allow to, and then being amongst everybody else. YURKEVICH:  It's that holiday nostalgia that Willowbrook Mall says will help this year's shopping season return to pre-pandemic expectations. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What group of islands is the most isolated population center in the world? The Galapagos, The Solomon Islands, Hawaii, or The British Isles? Answer is Hawaii. Surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the U.S. state is over 2,000 miles from California, nearly 4,000 miles from Japan. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Up next, the world's largest active volcano. The Mauna Loa in Hawaii, it's erupting for the first time in nearly years. The eruption is prompting an ash fall advisory for Hawaii's big island and surrounding waters.  The good news, there's no evacuation notice at this time. Lava flows are contained in the summit area and are not threatening to harm downslope communities according to the Hawaii Volcano Observatory.  The bad news is asphalt from the volcano could damage vehicles and buildings, contaminate water supplies, disrupt sewage and electrical systems. It could even damage or kill vegetation.  Mauna Loa has erupted 33 times since 1843 and covers half of the island of Hawaii and it's only 21 miles west of one of the most active volcanoes in the world, Kilauea, which is also currently erupting. When it erupted in 2018, it destroyed more than 700 homes. All right. From lava to dragon eggs. There's new drone technology that's improving an effective technique used to prevent wildfires, right? But it might not be what you think, not a soaring fire extinguisher or a water dropping drone. They're drones that drop fire in the form of, quote, dragon eggs to perform something called prescribed burning or starting a fire in order to avoid one later.  But some experts say that the technique is dangerous for firefighters. CNN business producer Jon Sarlin is here with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JON SARLIN, CNN BUSINESS PRODUCER:  This fireball-dropping drones are improving one of the oldest and most effective ways of preventing extreme wildfires, prescribed burning. CARRICK DETWEILER, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, DRONE AMPLIFIED:  Prescribed fires basically work by doing a very low intensity burn that will burn up the dead leaves and sticks that would cause major wildfires when they dry out later in the summer. We can reduce these huge wildfires by using more fire when it's safe to do so. SARLIN:  Many experts say prescribed burning should be used more often but it can be dangerous for firefighters.  DETWEILER:  They're often hiking out into the middle of mountains with a drip torch or they're riding an ATV and then you have helicopters with the whole crew on board flying really low and slow over the fire about a quarter of all while then firefighting fatalities are related to aviation. And for me, this really was a motivation to get these systems into the hands of firefighters. SARLIN:  Robotics researcher Carrick Detweiler started his company Drone Amplified to make prescribed fires safer, easier, and less expensive. DETWEILER:  Our system doesn't cover the amount of area that a helicopter can, but you can deploy tens or hundreds of our systems for the same cost as a helicopter. SARLIN:  On a 50-pound drone, Carrick secures a device that can carry 400 fireballs that ignite when they land on the ground.  DETWEILER:  We call these dragon eggs. They have potassium permanganate when you mix it with glycol, it starts a chemical reaction and a fire. SARLIN:  The drones allow firefighters to work at a distance from the flames and areas difficult to reach due to terrain or visibility. DETWEILER:  And this is really doubling the amount of time that firefighters can fight the fire when it's dark, when it's smoky, when other airplanes can't be out there. You can drop the balls in specific locations and this lets you do much more precise burns. SARLIN:  Precision is important, because even though prescribed burn escapes are extremely rare, the outcome can be devastating.  Two recent controlled burns in New Mexico led to the state's largest wildfire on record. DETWEILER:  Our system can help prevent escaped fires through the use of thermal cameras. You can see through smoke and look for any fires outside of the fire boundary. Our app also allows the firefighter to put in geofences to precisely control where the fire is starting and this lets the firefighters actually control the intensity of the fire. SARLIN:  Carrick says a hundred of their drone systems are now working for clients like the U.S. Forest Service and other federal agencies. But in the future, they envisioned similar systems in the back of every firefighter's truck. DETWEILER:  When firefighters are widely deploying these, we'll really be able to get up to doing more prescribed fire that's needed to mitigate these wildfires. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, we're taking a journey to the far side of the moon, and it all starts with a selfie. NASA's Orion spacecraft snapped a selfie as it approached the moon. The spacecraft was eight days into its and a half day mission at the time. The journey will go more than forty thousand miles beyond the far side of the moon and if Orion completes its journey, it'll be the farthest a spacecraft intended to carry humans has ever traveled. This selfie was snapped with a camera, on one of the capsule's solar panels. Pretty cool if I do say so myselfie.  And now on to my favorite part of the day. Special shout out to Calhoun Middle School in Denton, Texas. We see you.  Today, November 29th is Giving Tuesday. Every year on a Tuesday after Thanksgiving, people take time to give back.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, everyone? It's Wednesday. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and you are awesome. We're going to start today with a follow-up on the World Cup being played in the Middle Eastern country of Qatar. Yesterday was a huge soccer match between the USA and Iran, not just because it was a win or go home match for USA or that it was a win or draw or go home for Iran, but because of the political talking points surrounding the match. Some World Cup teams have been showing solidarity with anti-regime protesters in Iran who are fighting for women's rights. Some Iranian players even refrained from singing the national anthem ahead of their first match to show solidarity with protesters. But things really got heated when the U.S. Soccer Federation altered the Iranian flag on one of their graphics online, removing the Islamic emblem from the center of it. As a result, Iran called for FIFA, the World Cup organizers, to ban Team USA from the World Cup. That didn't happen, all this adding attention ahead of the match. Players from both sides while they do care about issues outside of sport, they really want to just focus on the game and their dream of playing in a World Cup. On Tuesday, the match finally arrived, and CNN correspondent Andy Scholes was at a watch party to take in the action. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDY SCHOLES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The party is on here in the U.S. at Fado Irish pub in Atlanta, Georgia, as Team USA is moving on. They had only scored one goal since June and that was against Wales last week, in their opening game of the World Cup. The fans here tense, waiting for the goal because they had to win the game. A tie wouldn't cut it this time around. And into the 38th minute, this place just exploded when Christian Pulisic came through with that goal to give the USA the 1-0 lead. They would hold on to win by that final score and they are now moving on to face the Netherlands. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was incredible. I thought we played the first half brilliantly. Towards the end, I was a little scared when we went defensive. But in the end, it all worked out. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So proud, so ready to the next round. I think we're going to kill it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This team is young, they're hungry, they don't 90 stop minutes strong. We got through it today. So happy, unbelievable win for the USA. Let's go baby all the way. SCHOLES:  And, Coy, as you can see this win meant so much for Team USA and their fans. And, hey, the good news is we get to do it all over again on Saturday. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. As we mentioned yesterday, the world's largest active volcano, Mauna Loa in Hawaii, has erupted for the first time in nearly years. Its neighbor, the Kilauea volcano, sits just 21 miles away and it began erupting more than a year ago. So, this rare dual eruption is expected to attract visitors from all over the world actually. Next, we're traveling to Hawaii with senior national correspondent Sara Sidner who recently flew over volcanoes in Hawaii to get a better understanding of the changing landscape and the science behind and under volcanoes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA SIDNER, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  As the sun rises each morning here in Hilo, Hawaii, it reveals destruction and creation happening simultaneously at the heart of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. I witnessed this from new heights with pilot and volcano expert Samantha Hanson. From up above, the full scale of volcanic activity is clear. SAMANTHA HANSON, PILOT:  If you look out here across the horizon, you see all these like little mini mountains out here, and these are all cinder cones. So, they're almost like many volcanoes right on the side of the big volcano. This whole thing right here that we're flying over right now, this is Mauna Loa. This is the largest volcano on the planet. SIDNER:  You really see how the lava spread out. HANSON:  Yeah. SIDNER:  I mean, it's very apparent. HANSON:  If you were to cut the island in half, it would look like Swiss cheese. It's just riddled with these lava tubes. As the island gets bigger and bigger, right, there's lava tubes, kind of, you know, build on each other. SIDNER:  But most of the volcano isn't what you see here. It's underwater where eruptions can and do occur, like the massive explosion in the waters off Tonga, just one of the over potentially active volcanoes worldwide, capable of creating earthquakes, tsunamis and entirely reshaping the landscape. One of the most devastating eruptions in Hawaii happened here in 2018 at Mount Kilauea where we joined volcanologist Kendra Lynn. KENDRA LYNN, VOLCANOLOGIST, U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY:  This was most significant collapse event that's really been recorded and observed since Western visitors arrived at the volcano. SIDNER:  Lava at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit crept across the island oozed over homes and roads and burst out of fissures. The eruption went on for over 100 days, destroying more than 700 homes and forcing thousands to evacuate. That one event dramatically changed the landscape. LYNN:  Here at the summit, almost daily, there was a magnitude earthquake as all of these rocks just started to collapse in on themselves and create the new crater. Which are kind of larger. SIDNER:  And the destruction brought a new course of exploration for Kendra, the study of rocks and how they form. LYNN:  We often looked to the rock record and the different types of rocks that are preserved around the volcano to understand past behavior. We look for patterns that might clue us into how the volcano will behave in the future. SIDNER:  Is there any prediction as to when the next eruption might be or what it's going to look like? LYNN:  It's difficult to say when, but we do know for sure that it will happen again someday. SIDNER:  Scientists are working hard to determine just how catastrophic that eruption might be. MICHAEL NEWMAN, PARK RANGER, HAWAII VOLCANOES NATIONAL PARK:  What's really remarkable about Hawaii is that it's a living landscape. It's a place where the volcano breathes. We can see the steam breathing from the crater. We can feel the movement of the earth. We can see land being created as we speak, and it's a place where we can really become in touch with nature. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these American retailers started in 1886 as a watch company? Sears, Target, Big Lots, or Costco? Considered to be the Amazon or Walmart of its day, Sears went on to become one of America's biggest retailers. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Once America's largest retailer and business employer, with an extensive retail network, Sears has struggled in the 21st century. It had more than 350,000 employees in 2006. But today, there are only 15 full-line Sears stores still open across the country and the company filed for bankruptcy years ago. We'll hear now from CNN's Rachel Crane on the slow demise of the iconic chain and how it was once both the Amazon and Walmart of its day. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RACHEL CRANE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Sears is in trouble, closing thousands of stores and losing billions of dollars. But once upon a time, Sears transformed the way Americans shopped. Back in the late 1800s in Minnesota, Richard Sears was spending his days as a railroad station agent, until one day, he sold some watches from a local jeweler and realized he was really good at selling. So, in 1886, he started a mail order company, the RW Sears Watch Company, and eventually hired a watchmaker Alva C. Roebuck. And in 1893, Sears Roebuck and Co. was born. Sears then became a very successful mail-order catalog company. This business model broke the mold. Remember, most Americans were living in small towns with access to only a few stores. They often made their own clothes and furniture or did without. Sears early catalogs only featured watches and jewelry. But soon these catalogs were more than 500 pages long, people could buy anything, from shoes, wagons, stoves and musical instruments. Sometimes, people even bought their homes directly from Sears. And because Sears bought in bulk, the company was able to charge customers lower prices. In 1925, Sears opened its first retail location in Chicago, and it wasn't just retail. Sears had a radio station, a mortgage business, a credit card. Sears was everywhere. Annual sales hit one billion dollars in 1945. The next year, sales doubled. Once Americans started to move to the booming suburbs after World War II, Sears began investing to help build malls. By 1970, Sears was considered untouchable by its rivals. But not all stories have a happy ending. As the 20th century came to a close, so did Sears' reign. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, check out this house.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Can you believe it's December 1st already? I swear it feels like it was just November yesterday. But no, just like that, only one month remaining in this year, so let's make it great. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we're starting with news out of China today, where protesters are taking to the streets in a rare display of defiance against the country's ruling communist party. The people are rising up against the zero COVID policy, a strategy that China has been using to limit the spread of COVID. But while the policy has kept China's virus levels lower than other large countries, it's placed millions of people under lockdown and quarantine, limiting their access to food medicine and family. It's also hurting the economy and restricting travel. Anger boiled over last week when a fire in an apartment building killed at least 10 people. Some believe the tragic deaths could have been prevented were it not for the anti-virus restrictions that may have prevented first responders from arriving more quickly. The authorities aren't messing around when it comes to shutting down the demonstrations and acts of defiance online as well. Hundreds of armored vehicles have been deployed to the streets. Authorities have vowed to, quote, strike hard if necessary. The number of people detained as a result of the resistance is not known at this time but the punishment for protesting in China can be severe. Senior international correspondent Ivan Watson has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  China's police state strikes back, flooding the streets of Beijing and Shanghai with police, an unmistakable show of force after a weekend of unprecedented protest in at least 15 cities across the country. In the eastern city of Hangzhou Monday night, police arrested people in a central square. And an eyewitness tells CNN police searched people's phones on the Shanghai subway, looking for apps that allow users to circumvent Shanghai's strict Internet censorship. The communist party's domestic security committee ordering officials to resolutely strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces, as well as criminal activities that destabilized social order. No compromise for peaceful protesters to voice their opinion. Meanwhile, health officials striking a slightly softer tone, calling for shorter lockdowns in the Chinese government campaign to eradicate COVID-19. CHENG YOUQUAN, CHINESE CTR. FOR DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION (through translator):  We need to minimize the inconvenience to the general public because of the anti-COVID-19 measures. As for the high-risk regions, we must have rigorous control. But at the same time, we should spare no effort to provide services to meet people's basic living needs and medical needs. WATSON:  A carrot and stick approach from different parts of the Chinese state, after the biggest nationwide display of discontent that this tightly controlled country has seen in a generation. Ivan Watson, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, we're going inside a cryptocurrency mine. Unlike the dollar, the euro, yen, franc or pound that you can put in your pocket, cryptocurrency is completely digital. It's created with encrypted computer algorithms. Many experts are quick to point out the issues with crypto, though, including market instability bankruptcies lawsuits and how it can actually harm the environment because the computers give off massive amounts of heat. That's why they're stored in crypto mines. We'll go now to northern Sweden with CNN reporter Anna Stewart who's found a mind that may be more sustainable for the environment if their plans to use the heat to grow things we can eat come to fruition. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER:  Well, this is what a crypto currency mine looks like the frozen rows of computers, in fact, there are 116,000 here. As you can hear, it sounds pretty noisy, and I can say that it feels really hot up close to these machines. There's about a 30 degrees centigrade difference though between here and here under one of the big bends where you're getting the cold air from outside. So, you can feel the energy that is coming out of these lots of power a small city, one of the reasons crypto mining can be just so controversial. But that is why Hive Blockchain Technologies have set up shops here in the north of Sweden. Come take a look why. Outside, some 500 meters along the River Lulea is a hydrogen power plant, a source of abundant cheap and renewable energy. JOHANNA THORNBLAD, PRESIDENT, HIVE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES:  This is the energy that is powering the Boden community and our data center that is located just nearby so this is also one of the main reasons that Hive has decided to bet on the Boden community. STEWART:  Given Europe is in an energy crisis, there will be people that think this is renewable energy. Should it be used for crypto mining? Shouldn't it be used to power people's homes and industry, keep lights on in hospitals? What do you say to them? THORNBLAD:  There are not enough inhabitants or companies to use all the energy that is available, so the community of Boden was inviting data centers to come to use this renewable stranded energy really. STEWART:  One crypto mining company is not just turning a profit in the midst of a crypto winter but also trying to forge a greener future, there are nearer term plans to turn the excess heat from the crypto mining into something more fruitful. THORNBLAD:  In the spring, we're going to support a Swedish company called Actira (ph). So they're building a huge, big greenhouse just at the back of our data center. And so, we will have tomatoes and cucumbers grown all year round in the very north of Sweden. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What is the geographical region at the base of South America which covers parts of Chile and Argentina? Colombia, Patagonia, Marmot, or North Face? Patagonia is your answer here, a nature lover's paradise where you could hike the Andes Mountains. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next, we head to Patagonia on the Chilean side, home to some of the most tantalizing topography and wondrous wildlife on the planet. The remote and rugged coastline region in south America is known for its gorgeous glaciers, beautiful lakes and rivers. But this region may be in danger. We'll meet Vreni Haussermann now, a marine biologist studying the wildlife in the region. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VRENI HAUSSERMANN, MARINE BIOLOGIST, SAN SEBASTIAN UNIVERSITY:  For me, Patagonia is the most beautiful part of Chile. It's a very remote, very wild and rugged coastline. Full of green forest, temperate rainforest, has lots of glaciers, rivers, lakes and the coast is very steep. The marine life came from deep waters but also from adjacent areas and so the diversity we find in fjords is elevated compared to other coastlines. My name is Vreni Haussermann. I'm a scientist working at the University of San Sebastian and I'm studying the marine biodiversity of Chilean Patagonia. Diving in Patagonia, we found many species that haven't been described before. The coastline is more than 100,000 kilometers, which is twice around the world. Only a handful of scientists working there. So even if we studied all the main areas, there are still most parts that we don't know yet. Chilean Patagonia was free of human impact for a long time, but in the '80s when aquaculture moved in, it started to be impacted. Life in the fjords has been reduced in abundance. There are species we hardly don't find anymore. By impacting an area where we know very little about, we always have the risk that we are damaging ecosystems and the equilibrium of the ecosystems is lost. I hope that humanity understands the need of protect our planet. I hope humanity understands the need of protecting the oceans and our lives and the lives of all future generations depend on a healthy ocean and a healthy planet. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, a reminder that it's never too late to right a wrong. In Minnesota, a library book was finally returned after being checked out 47 years ago. For decades, a Mercedes-Benz repair manual was missing from the shelves but earlier this month, it was mailed back with 200 bucks and an anonymous handwritten note saying that the sender had been fixing their car and although they probably couldn't afford the late fees maybe the library could buy a new book instead. Hope that dude finally got his car fixed. And you know I went to a bookstore the other day and saw a book called "How to End 50 Percent of Your Problems". So, I bought two. Shout out time now. Hanover Online School in Ashland, Virginia, thanks for subscribing typing and commenting on our YouTube channel. And thanks for all the love, @CoyWire on Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok. It is Thursday. So happy Friday eve people. My team and I are already working on a plan to finish this week strong with you right here on CNN 10. END221202

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. What a wonderful day. It's Friday and you already know Friday's rock. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, where we break down big news stories and easy to understand explanations with reporters all over the world, no opinion, no slant, just the news and we love having some fun with you. Starting with some good news today. Hurricane season is officially over in the United States. The hurricane season runs from June 1st to November 30th. And this season was notable for several reasons. One, it was calm the first half of the season. No hurricanes from July 3rd to the end of August, for the first time now since 1941. But the second half, three destructive hurricanes did hit the United States. Here's a breakdown: despite the slow start, there were 14 named storms, eight hurricanes, two of them major, registering category 3 or higher. Hurricanes Ian, Nicole and Fiona were among the most notable. Hurricane Ian made landfall as a category 4 storm, killing nearly 150 people, destroying homes and businesses. Tropical storm Ian also caused more than $50 billion in estimated damage. Several hundred Florida Keys residents marking the end of this hurricane season by gathering on Wednesday to celebrate. They burned hurricane warning flags. Some people though are still cleaning up damage left behind, mourning loved ones taken by storms. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In which of these U.S. states would you find a zip code that starts with a number 1? New York, California, Texas or Florida? Zip codes starting with a one represents New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next up, I want to introduce you to a very special principal who's empowering her students and defining her school's sense of pride. Principal Lisa Caldwell Linder from Brownsville neighborhood in Brooklyn came from what some would consider a rough neighborhood. But she always believed that she could rise above any of the negative aspects surrounding her and she did. Over time, she coined a phrase: "I am not my zip code". And she's using that phrase now to empower her students at her school and make them realize that they too can rise up higher than others might assume as possible. Meet Principal Lisa Caldwell Linder. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATHALY WARNER, FORMER ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL:  Ms. Linder sees natural abilities within people. KADIR ELLISON, FORMER STUDENT:  That's what I loved about her, that she just kept us on the right track. TRISTAN MILLS, JR., FORMER STUDENT, ASSISTANT BAND DIRECTOR:  Ms. Linder honestly gave me a safer environment. LISA CALDWELL LINDER, PRINCIPAL, PS/IS 184 NEWPORT:  My favorite phrase is "don't let the zip code fool you", because a lot of people do that. I am a product of Brownsville. My zip code growing up was 11212, and I'm sure if we Google one, one, two, one, two, all of the negatives will be exposed. I want our students to feel good regardless of their zip code. PS/IS 184 is a haven for learning. Attendance might be a challenge for a lot of our students because a violent crime may have been committed in the -- in the neighborhood, may have been committed in their complex, and there's some level of fear. Hence, that's why we try to create the safest environment internally. SUBTITLE: In order to improve attendance, Principal Linder created arts programs to encourage students to come to school. LINDER:  When I came here, I was a big advocate of the arts. Whole classes would just go to this one art teacher and no other arts offerings were made available. We instituted the following year where students were provided with an option to select which elective they would go to. So, to date, and we have the only marching band in district 23, we have added dancers to go along with the marching band. Broadway Jr. is like the creme de la creme of 184.  This year, we're doing Willy Wonka. So, you can see the difference. Students want to be present in school because we're rehearsing for Broadway Jr. We're performing for the Christmas showcase, right? So, I have to be present. So, we recognized by doing all of those things, it supported us with improving our attendance. Since the 10 years I've been here, we've seen sort of a roller coaster, I'll be honest, right? But we knew that we had to add and provide more. As a community school, we have a community resource director who identifies the gaps, what's not here. WARNER:  We are pretty much the hub of the community. Yeah, so when our parents are in need, they can come. LINDER:  How many parents are taking their children for exams? We're going to have the eye exams right here on site. WANDA SPEEDE, COMMUNITY RESOURCE DIRECTOR:  Today, as you can see, we had our food distribution of fresh produce, because we go into the supermarkets in the area, we will notice that there's a dearth of fresh natural foods. So, our book distribution, these are books that we've accumulated over the years, we've used them as class sets. We actually distribute those for free to families. So, we're excited that we can do this for the community. LINDER:  I will be retiring after 30 years with the New York City Department of Education. I felt like I had left an indelible impact on the school community and all the other communities I have worked in. AUBREY NICHOLSON, FORMER STUDENT:  Ms. Linder is an amazing person, and I would say that the school definitely, you know, started to thrive, I mean, when Ms. Linder got into the principal's office, definitely. MILLS:  Ms. Linder is like my second mother. ALIYAH BASKERVILLE, STUEDENT:  And thank you to Ms. Linder that she made that she's the main one who made this school and who made us feel powerful and brave. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. All of you powerful and brave people, your 10 out of 10 story today is about two friends from France who went to the World Cup in Qatar. Why? Because they traveled roughly 4,300 miles by bike. We're talking 13 countries, flooded woodlands in Hungary, a scorching desert in Saudi Arabia, dozens of flat tires. Their goal was to see their beloved team France, the defending World Cup champs. They told us, we're the kind of people that have big ideas and we don't want to have any regrets. Let's meet them. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MEHDI BALAMISSA, TEAM FRANCE FAN:  This crazy idea of going to Qatar from Paris by bicycle to attend the World Cup. GABRIEL MARTIN, TEAM FRANCE FAN:  It was under 7,000 kilometers, three months, 13 countries. We went from Paris to Istanbul. Istanbul, we went south was Jerusalem. Third of our adventure, weather in Saudi Arabia. BALAMISSA:  And we actually went through all kinds of landscapes, from Europe to the mountains of Turkey, and in the desert in the Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia. First stages in the desert were especially very hard because it's a very -- like it's such a hostile environment. And compared to what we experienced in Europe for example, there is just nothing around here. MARTIN:  We had a lot of surprises, but I think the most important but how hospitality is a world, a universal world. You know, in each country, we are received by people, giving us some food, even giving us some water, sometimes welcoming us at home. Arriving in Doha was incredible. There were so many people welcoming us especially from the French community based in Doha. We had the French national team here. They made the surprise to work on us, to take picture with us, and to offer the French national jersey with all the players signatures. BALAMSSIA:  So, we will fly back to Paris, but this doesn't mean bike trips are over the lifestyle that we actually loved, and I'm sure that we will want to go back on other adventures. We were actually very happy to document our trip and share with our followers on social media. And so, we also realized that this was a way of telling people that, look, you can take your bike and live adventures. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, lovely people. We made it. There ain't no mentum like momentum. So, let's finish this week strong and power right along into the weekend. First, though, a shout out to Lakeview Junior and Senior High School in Campti, Louisiana. Remember, you are more powerful than you know. I'm Coy. This is CNN, and it's been a blessing to spend this week with you. END221205

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. It's your boy Coy here, starting with some Monday motivation for you and me.  I challenge you to say the alphabet backwards -- Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T, S, R, Q, P, O, N, M, L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, G, A. Like that. And I want you to challenge me to work a unique word of your choice into tomorrow's show. Follow me @CoyWire on Insta, Snapchat and TikTok and put your challenge words in a comment, and I'll choose one fun one to work in tomorrow's show. All right. It's time for the best 10 minutes in news for you. CNN starts right now. We're going to start with the news out of Hawaii. On Sunday, huge amounts of lava continue to flow from the Mauna Loa volcano, the world's largest active volcano, which has been erupting for over a week now. It turns out the lava is creeping closer to a key highway that connects the east and west sides of the big islands of Hawaii. As of Saturday morning, the lava was just two and a half miles from the DKI highway. It had been moving around feet per hour over the last hours.  For now, the highway remains open and it's even attracted sightseers who have flocked the area to see the historic lava show. The volcano is erupting for the first time in almost four decades. The flow of lava is unpredictable. Its direction is expected to change hour to hour and day to day, making it difficult to estimate when or even if the lava flow will impact the highway.  In the meantime, Hawaiian officials say they have a plan to shut the highway down if the lava gets close enough to become dangerous. Now, while it may seem scary and potentially destructive, some people see it as beautiful. After all, the islands were formed as a result of volcanic eruptions. So without lava flow, there would be no Hawaii at all. CNN's David Culver is on the scene with the latest.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The nighttime glow of Mauna Loa's oozing lava -- well, you just have to pull over and properly admire it.  It's basically the middle the night and you guys are out here, why?  PIILANI ZYCH, OAHU, HAWAII RESIDENT:  Well, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to be able to experience this. And we decided to come early in the morning so we didn't have to sit in traffic.  CULVER:  Having hopped from Oahu to here, the big island, this family, three generations, came to respectfully honor the Hawaiian eruptions.  ZYCH:  It's all beautiful to us. So, we pay huge reverence to this. It's very culturally significant for us as well. So, it's a big deal.  CULVER:  A site made even more luring with the side of sunrise, which brought the crowds to old saddle road. Officials turning this stretch into a one-way street, allowing passersby the chance to stop and let the views seep in.  And that keeps drivers from pulling over and stopping on this, what is one of the main highways connecting one part of the island to the other. USGS and state officials warned, the lava flow, while slowed in recent days, is inching closer to cutting off this highway. It is within three miles now.  The other worry, not here on the ground but up in the air. What looks like plumes of smoke, experts say those are acid gases. Officials monitoring the levels, warning it could become tax toxic for residents and visitors of the big island.  Mauna Loa is the second of the big islands five volcanoes currently erupting. Kilauea is still rumbling after destroying more than 600 homes here in 2018.  But many Hawaiians see the potential path of destruction as simultaneous creation, surfacing from this, the world's largest active volcano.  And with the eruption continuing at its current pacing, officials feel like they should be able to give folks up to two days notice should the lava make its way onto that major thoroughfare cutting off that highway. But they also warn when it comes to the flow of lava, there is no forecasting. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Who conducted the first spacewalk, which took place in 1965? Alan Shepard, Yuri Gagarin, Ed White, or Alexei Leonov? While Ed White was the first American to space walk, the first to ever do it was Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  On Saturday, the International Space Station got powered up. NASA astronauts Josh Casada and Frank Rubio got suited up and floated outside the station to install a solar array or panel on the outside of the space lab. Their mission lasted seven hours. There were two solar arrays installed back in June of 2021, but now, the plan is to add a total of six more to hopefully boost the space station's power generation by more than 30 percent. The original solar arrays were only designed to last 15 years, but they've been supplying power for more than 20 years. They still work but they're definitely showing some signs of wear and tear after that long-term exposure to the environment.  When it comes to office views though, this one might be the best one in the world or the best out of this world. (MUSIC) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, a fresh look at a game of golf on the moon. Astronaut Alan Shepard will forever be remembered for becoming the first American in space in 1961. Putt in 1971, as commander of the Apollo 14 moon mission, he left viewers and even folks back at mission control stunned when he pulled out a club and ball to take a celestial swing on a fairway 230 miles away.  His moon game is now being seen in a whole new light after a NASA specialist dedicated over 10,000 hours to restoring flight film of the Apollo missions. Now here's teeing up for us right now. Roll it. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUBTITLE:  Over 50 years ago, Alan B. Shepard Jr. played a game of golf that was "out of this world".  Almost 240,000 miles away from Earth, Shepard hit two golf balls on the surface of the moon. Despite being so far away, he found a way to connect with the people back home. BRIAN ODOM, CHIEF HISTORIAN AT NASA:  I think it resonates with people because it's just a very human activity, a very, you know, a cultural thing that's taking place on the moon. So I think that's why it really resonates with folks. You can talk seismometers and all of this stuff all day long really of what they're doing on the moon, but you talk hitting a golf ball in the moon and people like, oh, yeah, right. Shepard obviously was the first American in space and he'd been grounded for a long time. So, you know, he thought he may never get to go back into space. So when he finally gets this, you know, his health works out and he gets this opportunity to go back, you can kind of see him thinking what's something fun and cool I can do to put my own stamp on this program. And, you know, sneaking things onto the capsule and hitting a golf ball, that seems to be pretty well in line with the Shepard we know. SUBTITLE:  Former property developer Andy Saunders found a new calling in enhancing poor quality NASA archive footage.  It was the lack of high-quality pictures of Neil Armstrong on the moon that started him on this path.  ANDY SAUNDERS, NASA DIGITAL RESTORATION EXPERT:  I wanted to see Neil Armstrong in the moon, he first person on another world, this monumental moment in history. Since childhood, I was obsessed with anything that could fly really from boomerangs and paper airplanes. Rockets were the ultimate, and it was also that added fascination with the moon. At one stage, I was kind of a semi-professional photographer, probably is about as serious as I got. And it's kind of uniting those two things, those two interests that led me to take on this, this particular project. SUBTITLE:  Like Armstrong, there was limited coverage of Shepard's feat, and it was Saunders' job to change that.  SAUNDERS:  They had TV footage of him swinging the club, live TV footage that was being back very, very, very low quality. But you couldn't see them and the ball disappeared off screen.  In the low res images, everything just looks like small rocks. But in a higher resolution scan, I could zoom right in, enhance it and find something which looked very much like a ball. SUBTITLE:  In February 2021, Saunders found the second golf ball and was able to accurately measure the distance traveled: 40 yards.  SAUNDERS:  When he said, oh, it's gone miles and miles and miles, I think he knew deep down that they didn't quite go that far. So 40 hours, that's terrible, but you know, they have these visors, they built your spacesuit. They could barely even see their feet. So visibility wasn't very good because of the restrictive suit, he had to hit it one-handed.  So to even make contact I think was pretty, pretty impressive. SUBTITLE:  Why do Shepard's actions resonate so much? ODOM:  It's the human side of this. It's, you know, that's the thing we can't forget. When it comes to a human activity, something that's done just for the joy of being alive, that's something that people can appreciate. SAUNDERS:  You know, a lot of people know that someone play golf on the moon but not a lot of those people would know that it was on Apollo 14. That there was even wasn't Apollo 14. So, you know, those human moments resonate forever, and that -- and that's one of the few. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  That's all we have time for, for now. We hope that that story helped to capture your i-moon-gination in this marvelous Monday.  Our shout-out today goes to a school of innovation. The Franklin School of Innovation in Asheville, North Carolina.  Our goal is to shout out all of your schools lunar than later. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire and this is CNN 10. END221206

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. As the ancient philosopher Confucius once said, we have two lives and the second begins when we realize we only have one. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. With just 86,400 seconds in this day, let's get going and let's make the most of them. We're going to begin with the latest out of Indonesia where Mount Semeru, a very active volcano, erupted on Sunday, blanketing roads and homes in volcanic ash and promoting evacuations of nearly 2,000 residents in the East Java province. The volcano spewed thick columns of ash, nearly 5,000 feet into the sky and as far as 7.4 miles away. Villages and nearby towns blanketed with falling ash, blocking out the sun but thankfully no casualties have been reported. On Monday, improved weather conditions allowed rescuers to resume evacuation efforts in a search for possible victims. The area of eruption is the most densely populated island in Indonesia, nearly 2,000 people escaped to emergency shelters at several schools. Indonesia's officials warned residents to stay at least miles away from the volcano's eruption center. But many felt they had to return to their homes Monday to protect their property. The eruption in East Java on Sunday following a series of earthquakes on the west of the island, including one last month that killed more than 300 people, and many residents are still traumatized after more than 50 people were killed, and thousands more displaced when the same volcano erupted just last year. We'll continue to follow this story as well as the Mauna Loa volcano eruption in Hawaii. Let's hear more now from my friend, CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice-over):  Ash fills the skies in Indonesia, forming a thick caustic cloud over Mount Semeru on the island of Java. Video from the country's ministry of environment and forestry captured the explosive eruption on Saturday a burst of ash shooting 15 kilometers into the sky, a sign for people living in the volcano's shadow it's time to go. This man, escaping on a motorbike, the ash caking on his face. He says he doesn't know where he's going just somewhere out of the volcano's reach. Authorities say nearly 2,000 people have been evacuated from the slopes of the volcano which is located about kilometers southeast of Jakarta. The roads in the area are packed with vehicles rushing to outrun the volcanic ash that is still raining down. Emergency workers are directing people out of the danger zone, handing out masks and urging them to go to shelters. INDAH AMPERAWATI MASDAR, LUMAJANG DISTRICT DEPUTY CHIEF (through translator):  We have readied some nearby schools and village halls. We will prepare them until the observatory post declares it's safe. CHINCHAR:  The damage has already been done to some areas. Rooftops are singed and the ground is covered with smoldering soot. Authorities are telling people to stay at least eight kilometers away from the eruption center, but there are fears the hot ash could drift further. So far, many people are heeding the warnings, a lesson learned last year when more than people were killed in a previous eruption and thousands were forced from their homes. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which U.S. state nickname was inspired by the sticky sap of its pine trees? California, Montana, North Carolina, or Alaska? With vast pine tree forests, North Carolina is nicknamed the Tar Heel State. Power outages in North Carolina are causing so much concern that the FBI is investigating. Officials believe intentional attacks on substations are causing power outages in Moore County near Fayetteville. But at this time, they haven't named any suspects or even motives. Forty thousand customers were in the dark as of Sunday. The investigation turned into a criminal investigation when utility crews found signs of potential vandalism to equipment at several different sites, including two substations that were damaged by gunfire. We're talking millions of dollars in estimated damage. In order to protect residents, property, businesses and public services, the authorities announced a mandatory curfew from 9:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m. in the county. The curfew which started Sunday will continue nightly until there's an emergency declaration. This outage is impacting the community in all sorts of ways as you can imagine. All schools in the county were closed on Monday. There was no church on Sunday. Traffic lights are out. Many businesses are closed, with a few stores using generators to open their doors. Authorities opened a shelter which is running on a generator. According to local officials, the damage is significant and rerouting power just isn't an option. As of Monday, an FBI manhunt was underway. But whoever is responsible remains a mystery to the community. We'll keep you updated in the coming days right here on CNN 10. Next up, CNN business producer Jon Sarlin is introducing us to BlocPower, one of a handful of companies looking to make clean energy affordable for everyone. The Brooklyn, New York-based business wants to help companies prioritize helping the climate, while also lowering utility bills and saving money. The company also targets dense and low-income neighborhoods where significant cost savings can help the most. They've reached nearly 1,200 buildings in New York so far. Let's learn more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JON SARLIN, CNN BUSINESS PRODUCER:  From eating locally to buying an electric car, being eco-friendly can be expensive especially when it comes to making our homes greener. In 2020, residential and commercial buildings accounted for 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. But the cost of buying and installing green technology can cost tens of thousands of dollars. DONNEL BAIRD, CEO, BLOCPOWER:  Greening buildings can be really difficult, complicated and hard and a little scary and expensive. SARLIN:  But what if it wasn't expensive, and you could make your building green without paying any upfront costs. A company called BlocPower is one of a handful of companies trying to make that possible. BAIRD:  Our job is, okay, how do we make clean energy affordable for everyone? A lot of building owners and property managers might not care about climate change as their top priority, but they definitely care about reducing their costs because that's money that can go in their pocket. SARLIN:  BlocPower leases and installs equipment like solar panels and heat pumps, energy efficient devices that both heat and cool buildings and use about 50 percent less energy than furnaces or baseboard heaters, all of which means lower bills. According to BlocPower, installing a heat pump can lower utility bills between 20 and 70 percent a year, the company is able to make back its money over time by taking a portion of the building's savings. LINCOLN ECCLES, BUILDING OWNER:  It looks very clean and very sleek. I like I like how you guys did this. This system it's quiet, it's clean. I've literally had tenants come up to me and tell me that they see a real savings in their actual electricity use. NOAH, BROOKLYN RESIDENT:  Right, so that we had a radiator system, the radiator was either just hot, extremely hot or non-existent, so my bill has significantly been a lot cheaper. SARLIN:  Greening buildings has become more competitive with companies like Sealed also offering retrofits with no upfront costs. BlocPower says it prioritizes greening dense, low and moderate-income neighborhoods where buildings are often outdated, and cost savings are needed most. BAIRD:  I grew up in a low-income apartment building. All the buildings were overheated. The tenants had opened up all the windows and we're burning energy that was like floating out of the window. And so, I was like man, there's a massive problem here. SARLIN:  Since 2004, Brooklyn-based BlocPower has upgraded over 1,200 buildings in New York, and they're partnering with cities around the country to help them hit carbon goals. With investment from the Bezos Earth Fund, they're currently building proprietary software that they say will help them identify greening opportunities for millions of buildings. BAIRD:  The most rewarding part of working at BlocPower for me is I'll be able to look my kids in the eye and say I did everything I could to prevent the climate disaster. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10, an Illinois 8th grade hooper hitting legendary status with an epic buzzer beater. Milton Pope down just one with just seconds to go and the opponent misses a free throw, but Cooper Thorson snags the rebound dribbles around, he heaves it, and you better believe it. Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Cooper hitting the nearly full court shot but dropping it like it's hot. The whole moment was caught on camera, creating the perfect viral moment. CNN highlight reel. Take that chef Steph Curry, this is Cooper's kitchen. And that kid is eaten. And now on to our favorite part of the day, I want to give a special shout out to Foxboro High School in Foxboro, Massachusetts. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one, going out and make someone smile today. Remember that kindness is not what you do, but who you are.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. I'm Coy Wire, ready to make this a wonderful Wednesday with you. But before, I start I must say I am bumfuzzled by the amount of creativity and passion with which you accepted my challenge to pick a word for me to work into yesterday's show. It was supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, if you didn't notice. And don't worry, I'll challenge you to another one next week. We start today with the latest on the economy. If you've watched the news in the last few months, it's likely you've seen concerns from consumers and experts about the economy or headlines featuring layoffs especially in the tech industry. However, this month, the economy showed a continued demand for workers, and new jobs were added to the market. This is despite the Federal Reserve's push to curb inflation which was predicted to impact the economy and the job market. Let's break it down by the numbers. Employers added 263,000 jobs this month. That's only a slight drop from 284,000 added in October and the unemployment rate was unchanged this month at 3.7 percent. We'll bring you now to Christine Romans, CNN chief business correspondent and anchor of "EARLY START" who will tell us more about the state of the economy and consumer concerns. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Behind all those headlines of tech layoffs, sour consumer confidence, inflation anxiety, it's an economy showing resilience. Surprising strength in the economy in the third quarter, 2.9 percent annual growth from July through September, a sharp bounce back from a contraction in the first half of the year -- you know, it's a pace that would have been considered very strong before the pandemic.  The job market remains strong, too. Another 263,000 jobs added in November. It's the fewest in months but it's more than economist forecast.  This year, a stunning 4.2 million jobs added. Stripping out the pandemic, it's the most jobs added in years. And inflation, while still too hot, is showing signs of cooling.  The fed's favorite inflation gauge, the PCE price index showing signs of peaking, and gas prices are falling. They're below where they were when Russia invaded Ukraine.  Call it the yes-but economy. Yes, consumers feel like the economy is bad, but they keep spending. After all, it was a record Thanksgiving shopping season. So, why the foul mood and the sometimes conflicting headlines?  Well, COVID broke the economy and putting it back together has been hard to measure. Remember tens of millions of jobs were lost overnight, schools closed, factories shuttered, more than a million lives lost. More than two years later, we're still struggling to gauge the strength and durability of the recovery. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia, which of these animals is part of the Canidae family? Grizzly bear, golden retriever, gopher, or goldfish? Often referred to as canines, dogs, including golden retrievers, are part of the Canidae family. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Up next, we're introducing you to a very special organization called Canine Companions. They're the oldest and largest organization in the U.S. that provides service dogs. They provide service dogs for children and adults with a wide range of needs, including both physical and emotional support. These pups are uplifting and they're pretty doggone cute, too. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELINDA SOWERS, VP, CANINE TRAINING AND CLIENT SERVICES, CANINE COMPANIES:  We're in Orlando, Florida. We are at the southeast region campus of Canine Companions. We are the largest and oldest organization that provides service dogs for children, adults and veterans with disabilities. And we work really hard to transform lives. At Canine Companions, we offer several different types of dogs. One of the types of dogs that we offer is a service dog. The service dog works with someone to mitigate their disability. They can pick up items, open and close doors, drawers, refrigerators. The dogs can know over 40 commands. We want the dogs to love the work they do. SUBTITLE:  Canine Companions places dogs who can help with more disabilities, PTSD, emotional support and physical therapy. SOWERS:  Since 1975, we've placed over dogs. We currently have over 2,600 graduates that are out there working with service dogs to our organization, and over 1,400 puppy raisers who are raising puppies for us. SUBTITLE: Dogs are trained from puppyhood for over two years before being placed with people in need. The service animals are matched with their new recipients during a process called "team training".  SOWERS:  Team training is just a magical time.  It's for so many of them, the moment that they have been waiting for.  IZZY & ALANA SHERMAN, CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA:  So, we applied I want to say a year and a half ago. We just knew that this was the right thing because as he's been in and out of hospitals because of brain cancer, and all the facilities we've been in have therapy dogs and they just bring so much joy to the kids. The ability to give her not only a companion but a skilled companion that can help with some of the challenges that we face daily. SUBTITLE:  Canine Companions breeds Labrador and golden retrievers for their temperament and work ethic.  SOWERS:  We provide all of our dogs free of charge just thanks to amazing donations.  SHERMAN:  I mean our medical bills are quite high. So it's really a gift to our family. SOWERS:  We want to make sure that anybody who needs a service dog or a facility dog is able to get one. SUBTITLE:  To increase their supply of service dogs, Canine Companions partners with Duke University's "Puppy Kindergarten," a program designed to identify strong service dog candidates.  Aurora attended Duke Puppy Kindergarten before finishing her training at Canine Companions.  SOWERS:  And then at the end of that team training class, they'll have a graduation ceremony where they will graduate and go home. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Today is Canine Companions national graduation day. Instead of a diploma, our graduates today will be handed a leash. SHERMAN:  You know, it isn't the unknown. And the unknown brings questions. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Congratulations. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, we're going to meet a voice that might be familiar to you if you've ever been on TikTok. I was pretty blown away actually when I found out this voice was actually a person and not a computer.  Let's meet Kat Callaghan, the real life woman behind TikTok's text to speech feature and one of the most popular influencers online. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAT CALLAGHAN, VOICE OVER ARTIST:  Songs that made artists famous.  If you have an air fryer, you need to try this. Would you sit in this seat? My name is Kat. I work with TikTok on TTS and other projects. You're probably sick of my voice. I am sick of my voice. SUBTITLE:  Kat Callaghan, the voice behind TikTok's "Jessie" text-to-speech feature, recently revealed herself on her TikTok account. CALLAGHAN:  I understand people are a little bit freaked out that have never heard my voice before in association with a human being. I've had interviews for the last several weeks with people going, okay, I can't -- I can't look at you, because I think you should say, I can't look at you when you're talking. And you don't hear it in my regular voice all the time but once I hit that upper inflection, you know you can hear it. SUBTITLE:  Callaghan, a radio host in Canada, is still getting used to the fact that her voice is TikTok famous.  CALLAGHAN:  People are recognizing me as the voice of TikTok, and also as a radio person. I was walking down the street and a car stopped and said, "Voice of Kat", which is my which is my TikTok handle is "Voice of Kat". And I'm just like, oh, yes, hello. SUBTITLE:  However, reactions from the revelation haven't been entirely positive, with users mocking Jessie's text-to-speech feature limitations.  CALLAGHAN:  The way I say law. Definitely not a perfect technology. I'd like to have fun with the fact though that Jesse mispronounces words.  Why do you say emoji like emoji? It's one of the funniest things to be honest with you is people commenting, say this, say that, or why do you pronounce it this way? So I plan to just continue to have a little bit of fun with that. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. We are so grateful to spend part of our day with you. To get your shout out, remember to subscribe to our YouTube Channel CNN 10, and leave a comment with your school, name, city, state and mascot, and the pronunciation if necessary. Chandler Academy in Charleston, West Virginia, thank you for showing the love. We're showing it right back at you. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire and this is CNN 10. END221208

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. It's Thursday. So happy Friday eve. It's your boy Coy, Mr. Clean, but I keep it cleaner. Let's keep crushing it this week each day aiming to be a little better than the day before. This is CNN and it's time to fuel our minds. We start with an update. China is scrapping some of its most controversial COVID rules, moving away from their strict zero COVID policy which have caused people mental and emotional stress and strain. Earlier this month, protesters took to the streets in a rare display of defiance against the country's ruling communist party. The people are reeling from the effects of the government placing millions of people under lockdown and limiting access to loved ones, food and even medicine. All this on top of the economic strain it's caused. China's zero COVID policy has kept the nation's infection rate lower than countries like the United States by isolating every case of COVID and shutting down the surrounding areas. But easing restrictions now marks a significant step in the government's plans to reopen the country. This week, the Chinese government announced 10 new guidelines that loosened restrictions, most notably allowing people with COVID to quarantine at home instead of being taken to an isolation facility, a practice which previously frightened its citizens. The government is also dropping mandates that required proof of a negative COVID test to enter public places. These are some of the significant steps which should offer relief to China's residents after nearly three years of disruption to their daily lives and economic futures. But there's still concern. Twenty-five million people in China have not received a coronavirus vaccine. If there's an influx of new cases, it could overwhelm the hospital system, leading to a potentially tragic situation for citizens. Our Selina Wang has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  This is the kind of line Beijingers stand in, outside in the cold to get their COVID tests. A 48-  hour test is required to get into most places. But there aren't many places to go. Much of Beijing is still closed down. This is one of the most popular tourist places in the city. But the restaurants are largely closed, and the malls are pretty empty. So, this McDonald's is still open but for takeaway only. But even to get takeaway, you've got to prove that you're clear of COVID. Here's how I do it. I open up the health app on my smartphone, I scan the QR code. So, it says, I've got a green code, and I've got a recent COVID test, so I'm good to go. This code dictates all of our daily lives in China. Green means good to go. Red means I may have to isolate at home or go to a mass quarantine facility. This allows China to track the movements of virtually all 1.4 billion people in the name of contact tracing. I've got to scan my code to get into a taxi, a public park, a mall, or a coffee shop. Even a public bathroom. (voice-over):  I ran into a group of delivery people on the street. They've got to do COVID tests every single day to do their jobs. This woman tells me the pandemic has been hard on her. I ask her why. She says it's because she's scared of the virus. Getting COVID in China is unlike anywhere else in the world. You and your close contacts all get sent to a quarantine center. This is a convention center in Beijing that's been turned into a massive quarantine facility with thousands of beds. But some of these facilities in the country, they are in very run-down and unsanitary condition. And then your whole building or community could go into lockdown. I spoke to a man who's been in and out of quarantine six times already just this year. He tells me his whole building of more than 200 families went to a quarantine facility last month, because they were considered close contacts. He says he's not scared to get COVID because omicron is less severe and his whole family has been vaccinated. I approached a few people just released from this mass quarantine center here. I ask if they had tested positive for COVID. Yes, the man nods and says they have recovered. "How many days did you spend in there?" I asked. "Seven days," he said. Unprecedented protests recently erupted across China. They are chanting that they don't want COVID tests, they want freedom. Authorities swiftly cracked down on the protesters. But they are finally softening their stance on zero COVID. Some cities are lifting lockdowns, changing COVID testing requirements. Under some conditions, people can now quarantine at home if they have COVID, which is a huge deal. But this country has already built up a whole infrastructure around zero COVID, spending all of its resources on quarantine facilities and COVID testing. So it's going to be a long and slow exit from zero COVID. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In the animal kingdom, oysters are classified under what phylum? Mollusca, arthropoda, chordata or porifera? Oysters are soft-bodied invertebrates belonging to the phylum mollusca. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Did you know that scientists estimate that oysters have been around for 15 million years and they're far more valuable than the beautiful pearls that they can produce. The reefs that take shape as they grow together create a shelter where hundreds of other species can flourish. They're also crucial for ocean health, filtering the water around them. One oyster can filter gallons of water per day. Let's hear now from conservationists who are hoping to be successful in restoring Hong Kong's famous oyster reefs in CNN's Call to Earth. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Tucked away in the northwest corner of Hong Kong with the high-tech Chinese mega city of Shenzhen in sight is a rich habitat that is home to mangroves, soft, muddy shores and oyster reefs that date back centuries. For over 700 years local farmers cultivated oysters here in the mud flats of Pak Nai and recent decades, traditional oyster farming has declined due in part to coastal reclamation and over harvesting. But conservationists like Marine Thomas have discovered that reintroducing oysters to the abandoned reefs can boost biodiversity and strengthen these shores. MARINE THOMAS, SENIOR CONSERVATION PROGRAM MANAGER, THE NATURE CONSERVANCY:  Usually, people will associate oysters with food but less known is that oysters and other shellfish create habitats. They create reef habitats. In fact, just like coral reefs, they will bunch together and create these hard structures that you can actually walk on. STOUT:  In a survey of the city's coastlines, researchers from the Nature Conservancy at the University of Hong Kong discovered existing reefs like these old farms could potentially act as a source of oyster larvae. They also found that a single Hong Kong oyster can filter up to 30 liters or 8 gallons of water an hour, one of the highest filtration rates recorded for the species. Another finding, the reefs host six times more species and bare mud flats as the piles of shells provide shelter for worms and small crabs, attracting a variety of animals including birds like this little egret. And yet another benefit is mitigating the effects of climate change, so how does the humble oyster do that? THOMAS:  So the humble oyster will also help us fight climate change if it's in a reef structure so if it's in a hard reef structure that is creating a barrier, think of it as a natural sea wall then it's going to be creating friction on the sea bottom that will attenuate wave action and therefore also flooding at the back of it. STOUT:  Since 2020, Thomas and a team of volunteers have been at work restoring this abandoned oyster farm. They dry old shells in the sun before returning them to the water to form a base for oyster larva to attach to. They hope to introduce millions of oysters to help revitalize the area over the next few years. ASHLEY HEMRAJ, MARINE BIOLOGIST, THE SWIRE INSTITUTE OF MARINE SCIENCE, THE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG:  One of the biggest things that always amazes me and makes me happy is seeing all the number of crabs here, especially here as you walk, the crab walks away. It's -- if you fix on it, it's quite amazing to see this. It is really, really beautiful. STOUT:  As new oysters grow, they clean the water, provide shelter and food for wildlife and join forces with the mangroves as a coastal buffer. A spectacular sunset descends on Pak Nai as these small briny creatures work to build an ever more vibrant ecosystem. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, if you're a jogger and you're claustrophobic, this race is not for you. Hundreds of jolly old joggers in a Santa run in Michendorf, Germany, jingling all the way, dressed in red from head to mistletoe, look at all those Santas go. Talk about spreading Christmas cheer, this is the 14th annual race. One Santa said that even if you finish last, it's being there that counts. They ran in near freezing temperatures, maybe getting fit to deliver those gifts, Santa even without his sleigh still slays. It's slay-NN 10, the most wonderful time of the year and the most wonderful part of this show: you. Special shout out to all the teachers today. Keep up lifting, informing and inspiring students. Going up and dap your teacher up give them a handshake or a high five. Let them know that you appreciate them. Also getting a shout out, Holdrege Middle School in Holdrege, Nebraska. Keep shining. I'm Coy Wire. I'm headed to Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love. So I'll see you from there tomorrow. END221209

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people, and welcome to the city of Brotherly Love, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, my home state. I'm standing in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and you may recognize those steps, the iconic rocky steps. We're here for one of the greatest rivalries in all of sports. Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. Eastern, it's the 123rd edition of the Army-Navy football game and it's so much more than a game. Dating back to 1890, the traditions, pageantry, passion and respect make the Army-Navy game the greatest rivalry in American sports. The game is so big, 10 sitting U.S. presidents have attended, from Theodore Roosevelt in 1901, to Donald Trump two years ago. It is humbling to watch this rivalry. It's said that this is a game where everyone playing is willing to die for everyone watching. That's powerful stuff. This is America's game. If only all of us could have the perspective of these individuals representing the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York. They stand their ground against the opposing side, but afterwards, they walk across the field and embrace each other as brothers and sisters because they never forget that in the end, they're all on the same team. But don't get me wrong they play hard for bragging rights that'll last a lifetime. Navy leads the series 62-53-7 all time and to paraphrase the 34th president of the United States Dwight Eisenhower, the Army and Navy are the best of friends 364-1/2 days out of the year. But on this one Saturday afternoon, they are the worst of enemies. The rivalry is also loaded with traditions, like when Army West Point's marathon team runs the ball about 150 miles through the night and through the elements, from West Point to Philly. There's also a flyover before the game during the national anthem, and there isn't a dry eye in the stadium. Later on in the show, I'll tell you about some of the fun pranks associated with the rivalry. But first let's take a look at some of the headlines of today. WNBA star Brittney Griner was released from a Russian prison yesterday. In February, she was arrested on drug smuggling charges when traveling through the Moscow airport. In August, she was sentenced to nine years in a Russian prison. Griner's release on Thursday was part of a prisoner swap between Russia and the United States. A convicted Russian arms dealer Victor Bout was released from a U.S. prison. He was previously sentenced to 25 years on charges of conspiring to kill Americans and providing weapons to terrorist organizations. The swap did not include another American that the state department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whalen. Here's what President Biden had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We never forgot about Brittney. We've not forgotten about Paul Whelan who's been unjustly detained in Russia for years. This was not a choice of which American to bring home. We brought home Trevor Reed when we had a chance early this year. Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul's case differently than Brittney's. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul's release, we are not giving up. We will never give up. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next up, scientists say they have now confirmed why we get more colds in the wintertime, and they say it's a major breakthrough. According to a recent study, it turns out that the cold air damages the immune response occurring in our noses. When we're exposed to cold air the temperature in our nose can drop by as much as 9 degrees Fahrenheit and that kills nearly percent of the billions of virus and bacteria fighting cells in our nostrils. It's enough to essentially knock out all of the immune advantages that our nose has to offer. More research is needed to understand how this research could be used to prevent illness in the future. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these prehistoric animals was a marine reptile? Allosaurus, Plesiosaur, Diplodocus or ankylosaurus? While the others on this list were all land dinosaurs, the plesiosaur was a marine reptile and an intact skeleton of one was just discovered in Australia. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUBTITLE:  This 100-million-year-old intact plesiosaur skeleton was discovered in Queensland, Australia. Amateur paleontologists known as the "Rock Chicks" uncovered the remains of the 19-foot-tall reptile in August. Researchers say the finding may provide vital clues about prehistoric life. DR. ESPEN KNUTSEN, SENIOR CURATOR OF PALEONTOLOGY, QUEENSLAND MUSEUM:  So, usually, what we find is that when we're digging these things out of the ground is that we'll find bits of the body, no head, and very, very rarely, we'll find just ahead, but unfortunately with no body attached. So the fact that this guy had both allows us to close that gap where they have this overlap between the body and the head that will unravel a lot of the species diversity, of how many species of these long neck pieces also swimming around here in this outback ocean 100 million years ago. SUBTITLE:  Plesiosaurs are not classified as dinosaurs as they did not have gills and had to surface to breathe. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Okay. Now to those pranks I was telling you about. As I mentioned at the top of the show, there's so much tradition associated with the Army-  Navy game but some of it is all in good fun. Exhibit A, this year, Navy flew over the Army's campus and dropped a bunch of ping pong balls that said, go Navy, beat Army. But every year, the Navy has to protect their beloved mascots, their goats, because the Army tries to steal them. A while back I got to interview the goats and their protectors. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Preparations for the Army-Navy game can be intense. You have the game plan, the playbooks and the practices. But perhaps one of the most important facets of pre-game preparations here in Annapolis has nothing to do with the players, but rather mascots, goats, and more specifically protecting the goats. Can you tell us where you keep the goats? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I can't tell you that.. WIRE:  We won't tell anyone. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, afraid I can't do that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We don't want Army to come and steal it, like we know they're not capable of doing it, but just for a precaution measures. WIRE:  So, we're talking maybe confidential, secret or the location of the goats. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Above top secret. So, we're -- this is a whole separate classification. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They're kept at a pretty secure location though. They have a guard dog. WIRE:  So, there is a guard dog? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There is, and he is massive and scary. WIRE:  You think if I ask a goat, maybe they would tell me where they're kept. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You could definitely try but they've been briefed heavily, and let's just say they probably won't give you anything either. WIRE:  Can you tell us where your hideout is? Are you aware of the Army's hype video that they released? It alludes to an elaborate plot to steal the goats this year. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Confirm the role of Billy the Goat is the head of Navy spirit group. WIRE:  Does it make you nervous? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It does not. I've seen our security measures and especially the dog once again is I don't think anyone could get past him. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We feel the goods are pretty secure, and not many people know their location, and even if they did, they'd have a hard time stealing them. UNIDENTIFIED MALES:  Fear the goats, beat the Army. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. For today's 10 out of 10, the Oxford Dictionary just announced their word of the year. Drum roll, please. It's -- wait, what? The word is goblin mode, technically two words. It's a slang term that became popular during the pandemic, and it means someone that is unapologetically self-indulgent and loves being lazy. This way of life rejects all social expectations. Yeah. I know, we're not talking about anyone in this group, right? Yeah, sure. All right. We are going to switch from goblin mode to beast mode. All right, being that we're at one of the most popular tourist destinations in all of Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, you know I had to take you on a run with me up the iconic Rocky steps from the 1976 film "Rocky". Thousands of people flock to these steps every year to mimic one of the most famous movie scenes in the world. Rocky Balboa finishing a morning run at the top of these steps, a symbol for all the underdogs out there. Now, we're going to give a special shout out to New Hope Middle School in Columbus, Mississippi. Rise up. And for all of you underdogs out there, keep working everyone every single day. Keep believing in yourself, so that you can make your dreams come true, too. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. Yo, Adrian! END221212

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone.  I'm Coy Wire, and welcome to a special edition of CNN 10. You likely don't know this but the program you're watching right now started all the way back in 1989 when CNN launched a news program designed for the classroom. And today, we're going to look back at one of the most influential stories from that year. It involves protests in China's Tiananmen square that changed the course of history. Tiananmen Square is located in the center of the Chinese Capital of Beijing. In 1989, after several weeks of demonstrations by students and other citizens calling for a more Democratic government, Chinese troops entered the square on June 4th and fired on civilians. It's estimated that several hundred to thousands were killed, and as many as 10,000 people were arrested. Accounts of the massacre are still censored in China today. We now have a special report of CNN's coverage from on the ground that year and as you'll see after the Chinese government pulled the plug on the broadcast, CNN had to report by telephone and use video that was snuck out of the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NARRATOR:  Fifteen years ago, China was still almost totally isolated from the rest of the world. Today, the encouragement of private enterprise, free markets, foreign investment, and the introduction of western products and ideas has made this country the pioneer in the communist world search for reform. But now, China's reform program has run into trouble. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Inflation officially has been at the 20 percent level in recent months. Corruption has grown a great deal. NARRATOR:  These dislocations caused by an economy that is only half reformed, neither communist nor capitalist, have generated widespread public discontent. SUBTITLE:  CNN was in Beijing as public discontent led to demonstrations and one of the darkest moments in China's history. NARRATOR:  In the dead of night, 2,000 students marched through the streets of Beijing, calling for democracy human rights and the resignation of the Chinese government. Their destination: Tiananmen Square in the city center. SUBTITLE:  Tiananmen Square is the government's ceremonial center and one of the largest plazas in the world. NARRATOR:  It was here that the students placed a huge banner honoring the memory of Hu Yaobang, who died on Saturday in political disgrace purged by communist party hardliners two and a half years ago for his liberal views. To the students however, Hu represented hope for reform and change, hopes that to many Chinese have been dashed by recent government efforts to scale back economic and political liberalization. There has never been a challenge to the leadership of communist China like this one. In cities all across the country, crowds taking to the streets to demand democracy and freedom. In commemorating Hu's death by demanding the implementation of the progressive policies he advocated, the students have put the government on the defensive, most notably by using tactics such as the peaceful sit-in that the authorities here have never seen. PROTESTERS:  Long live freedom! Long live freedom! Punish corrupt officials! Punish corrupt officials! Freedom of the speech! Freedom of the speech! SUBTITLE:  Chinese leadership was divided on how to respond and attempted to limit the public's awareness of the demonstrations. However, some journalists were sympathetic to the demonstrators. NARRATOR:  The students got a big boost when several official Chinese newspapers defied government orders and published accurate accounts of the events of the past week. SUBTITLE:  As public support grew; student activists encouraged the general population to join the call for reform. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  If you're going to have a student movement, you must seek support from the workers and peasants. Only if they understand can we succeed. NARRATOR:  Again and again, the badly outnumbered police were overwhelmed and pushed aside. SUBTITLE:  On May 4th, nineteen days after the protests began, tens of thousands of demonstrators converged on Tiananmen Square. May 4th was the anniversary of the 1919 student movement that led to the communist revolution. REPORTER:  This was the demonstrator's destination, Tiananmen Square, the heart of Beijing, the seat of the government. NARRATOR:  The scene at Tiananmen showed the depth of public discontent here now, over inflation, corruption and the lack of political freedom. SUBTITLE:  One month into the demonstrations, The students sang the Internationale, the international communist anthem. NARRATOR:  On the eve of Mikhail Gorbachev's visit, China's rebellious students up the stakes in their confrontation with the government, adopting a new set of tactics to force a faster pace of reform. Two hundred students started a hunger strike, marching through Beijing to downtown Tiananmen Square, vowing to stay without food until the authorities agreed to recognize their illegal students' federation. SUBTITLE:  China's leaders were scheduled to meet in Beijing with Mikhail Gorbachev to mend years of strife between the communist republics. NARRATOR:  With Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union's pioneer of political reform due here on Monday, no one in the Chinese leadership wants him to have a reception like this. SUBTITLE:  The number of hunger strikers quickly grew. REPORTER:  This is now the third day in which about a thousand students have been carrying out a hunger strike to press their demands for democracy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Gorbachev's reforms have been extremely successful. So we hope his visit will help accelerate political reform in China. NARRATOR:  A growing number of those in the square are not students but journalists professional people and especially workers impatient for change. For China's leaders, there could not be a more embarrassing or frightening set of circumstances. BERNARD SHAW, CNN ANCHOR:  Now some thoughts, I came to cover a summit. I walked into a revolution, a massively peaceful statement by the people but still a revolution. SUBTITLE:  By May 19, an estimated 1.2 million demonstrators had gathered in Tiananmen Square. NARRATOR:  Huge crowds again serves through the center of Beijing, people from all walks of life, workers, taxi drivers, shopkeepers, even some peasants from the countryside while lending their support to the hunger striker's demand for freedom and democracy. At the same time, over a hundred thousand people demonstrated in Shanghai where 300 students had begun their own hunger strike. SUBTITLE:  Government leaders visited the students to ask them to end their hunger strike. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You have every right to criticize us. I'm also not here to ask for your forgiveness this time. NARRATOR:  Communist Party Chief Zhao and Premier Li visiting Tiananmen Square to appeal for an end to the student hunger strike. Late in the evening, Premier Li appeared on nationwide television to announce that the situation was out of control and that the army was being called in to restore orders. LI PENG, PREMIER OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (through translator):  The situation in Beijing is getting worse and it is going to bring out a nationwide riot if we don't really do anything to crack to stop this situation. NARRATOR:  Communist Party Chief Zhao, a liberal who had sympathized with the students, being enforced to resign. REPORTER:  There is word authorities decided he had to go because he refused to agree to use force against the students. LI:  For a month, the government has taken very calm and tolerant attitude towards the students' demonstration. We did this because we love our students. SUBTITLE:  Premier Li Peng claimed that the students were under the influence of a few troublemakers, and those on hunger strike were 'hostages". The People's Liberation Army was ordered in to clear the square. REPORTER:  Masters of demonstrators marched out of Beijing and rode in cars to the west. Before dawn, more than one hundred thousand were on the outskirts of the city, taking the confrontation to the troops, not waiting for the army to reach town. SHAW:  The People's Liberation Army blocked by the people. The troops cannot move to clear Tiananmen Square. ANNOUNCER:  This is CNN's Prime News. And in Beijing, Bernard Shaw. SHAW:  Let's go quickly to Jeanne Moos in Tiananmen Square -- Jeanne. JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Bernie, we don't have any real hard information down here. The same announcement keeps coming over the PA system. It's an official announcement signed by the premier of China, according to the announcer. And it talks about martial law being imposed here in Tiananmen Square. It was a night of tension, a break of celebration in the morning of uncertainty. SHAW:  Jeanne, Jeanne? MOOS:  Yes, Bernie? SHAW:  I'm being told that the government officials are coming into the CNN control room now. This man with a piece of paper in his hand. I'm certain that is not a party invitation. Okay, let me quickly tell you what this official is saying: if you do not obey the orders, you will not be allowed to come home. This official on the right side of your right side of your screen saying to CNN, if you do not obey the -- NARRATOR:  The Chinese government ordered all foreign media to stop broadcasting. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You have him call us properly and explain to us what is happening here. If you cannot give us an explanation. UNIDENTIIFIED MALE:  Moment, please? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Fine. SHAW:  We're told that President George Herbert Walker Bush is watching what's happening. President Bush is saying, quote, word of the news blackout is very disturbing. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our government led me to tell you now stop your transmission. SHAW:  These characters being written on this legal pad in effect are saying that this government is telling CNN to end its transmission. (END VIDEOTAPE) END221213

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. We have a rendezvous with the news. I'm back from Philly, feeling refreshed, ready to crush this week with you. We start with a rocket ship returned. After a 25-1/2-day mission around the moon, NASA's historic Artemis I mission made a successful splashdown on Sunday. The uncrewed test flight was meant to pave the way for future missions, which could take astronauts back to the moon, The Orion spacecraft pulled off a record-breaking mission including two lunar flybys, one with an 80-miles of the lunar surface, more than 1.4 million miles traveled in all before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean, just west of Baja, California. After landing, the capsule spent six hours in the ocean with NASA collecting additional data and running some tests before the rescue team moved it, a fleet of recovery vehicles were waiting nearby. The landing was key to making sure that the Orion spacecraft is ready to fly real astronauts next time and then eventually to Mars. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  And here we go, the lead-up to the Artemis I launch might have been a bumpy ride after a series of delays due to technical glitches and bad weather, but NASA says once its mega rocket got off the ground it's being smooth sailing. MIKE SARAFIN, ARTEMIS MISSION MANAGER:  We got to witness the world's most powerful rocket take the Earth by its edges and shake the wicked out of it, and it was quite a sight. BLACK:  After three and a half weeks in space filled with engine burns, lunar flybys and stunning views of the earth and the moon, NASA's Orion spacecraft is home. But before it's splashed down a critical test, in one of the most nail-biting times of the re-entry process, the Orion capsule will separate from its service module then complete a skip maneuver off the edge of the Earth's atmosphere, which will bring it closer to its landing site and cut down on the G-forces that future astronauts will have to endure. After that, all eyes are on the heat shield as Orion blazes back to earth at temperatures twice as hot as molten lava. NASA says the heat shield has been tested more than a thousand times and making sure it can take the heat is one of the primary goals of this mission. From the outset, the uncrewed Artemis I mission has been a dry run to make sure the spacecraft is safe enough for astronauts to fly on board. BILL NELSON, NASA ADMINISTRATOR:  We are stressing it and testing it in ways that we will not do to a rocket that has a human crew on it. BLACK:  If Artemis I is a success, it will be followed by Artemis II, which like the first mission will fly around the moon, but this time with a crew. That will be followed by Artemis III, which intends to return astronauts to the moon's surface, including the first woman and person of color. Later missions will aim even further with the goal of sending astronauts to Mars. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE (voice-over):  Ten-second trivia: The equator runs directly through which of these countries? Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria or Ethiopia? All of these countries are close to the equator but only Kenya is crossed by it. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  We have introduced you to several of our CNN heroes this year but on Sunday night, Anderson Cooper and Kelly Ripa announced the CNN Hero of the Year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  The CNN Hero of the Year is -- KELLY RIPPA AND COOPER:  Nelly Cheboi! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Congratulations to Nelly Cheboi. She creates computer labs for school children in her native Kenya. In 2019, Nelly quit her software engineering job to create her non-profit TechLit Africa. Since then, she's provided thousands of students with upcycled computers in a way to connect with the world. Voters online selected Nelly from a list of CNN's Top 10 Heroes. As CNN Hero of the Year, she will receive one hundred thousand dollars to expand her work. Her story is incredible. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NELLY CHEBOI, CNN 2022 HERO OF THE YEAR:  I never forget what it was like growing poor. I never forget what it was like my stomach churning because of hunger at night. I would have to go and scavenge for food at trash bits. We grew up in a tin roof house. It was full of potholes. I used to look at the different light bouncing from the holes from the roof, and then just imagine what we look like to sustainably fix poverty. I was a very hardworking student even though I wasn't in school often, and even though I was the most hardworking person I knew, I still did not know what a computer was. I am from Mogotio which is a small village in rural Kenya. And there isn't much of an economic activity here. I got a full-ride four-year scholarship in America at Augustana College in 2012. I got a job as a janitor cleaning bathrooms. I discovered computer science in my junior year of college just out of accident. I needed to take an introduction to java for my math major and I just fell in love with it. I just knew this was what I wanted to do and also bring it to my community. Every three years, companies are upgrading their IT. Most of these computers are ending up in landfills. Well, we have kids here, myself included back in the day, who don't even know what a computer is. And so, what we're doing is that we're working with institutions, colleges, companies, even individuals and then we bring it to the schools. We refurbish them. We install our own custom operating system that is geared towards teaching our kids self-efficacy, troubleshooting and Internet skills. All of you are going to be graphic designers today. The kids that we are working with are actually from four years old all the way to 12. And there's also vectors, it doesn't matter how much you zoom, it's still perfect, it's still a line. We have people coming in and just inspiring the kids. They can go from doing a remote class with NASA to music production, video production, coding, personal branding and so on. Right now, we're working with 4,000 kids. My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, their families and themselves will not need aid because they can make money online. That money will support their families. Their money will support themselves. I can't even describe just how dehumanizing poverty is. Just getting crushed over and over again. My mom was working really hard and I was still going to bed hungry. I was still living in a house that was flooding. But the world is your oyster when you are educated. The thing that was really fascinating me growing up, not seeing change, not seeing hope, not even seeing progress. I feel like with this kid, I can see a path like, I can see a way where they can make a living online. And that is really like why we're doing this work. My life is bigger than myself. If I have the power to change anything, I have to do it. I have to give it my all. I can keep doing it. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, Mother Nature is up to snow good. Areas in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California were pummeled with up to three to four feet of snow over the weekend. Snow my goodness. Combine that with strong winds and even hail, and look out, don't get in that ski lift. It's about that time of year I guess whenever all that snow melts, it'll be thaw-some. If high fives, hugs and handshakes were snowflakes, I'd be sending you all a blizzard. Thank you for all the love. We're sending it right back to you. Shout out to Patrick Henry Middle School in Woodhaven, Michigan. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. END221214

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. It's your boy Coy. Wonderful Wednesday to you. Last week, so many of you accepted my challenge. You are giving me a unique word of your choice to work into the show. We had a lot of fun responses so we're doing it again. It's your word Wednesday. Follow me @CoyWire on Insta, Snapchat and TikTok, and put your challenge words in the comment section of my most recent post, and we're going to choose one fun word to work into Friday's show. All right. It's time for the best minutes in news because it's with you right here on CNN 10. We start with news on a winter storm. This week all across the country, winter storm warnings, winter storm watches and winter weather advisories have been issued by the National Weather Service. The strong start to the snow season is in place for an area that extends as far east as the upper Midwest, northern Great Lakes and interior parts of the Northeast. In fact, 25 million people from Texas to Mississippi are under threat of severe storms. In the south, two tornado watches are in effect. One in the Dallas area, the other in southern Oklahoma and about 15 million people largely in the north central U.S. are under winter weather warnings or advisories including fears of intense snow, ice, hail and freezing rain. These storms are leaving a trail of damage especially in parts of Oklahoma and Texas where buildings were wiped off of their foundation and homes and businesses were seriously damaged. In addition, roads were closed in traffic was delayed. This remains a developing story we're going to keep you updated right here on CNN throughout the rest of this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: in science, what is occurring when two atoms slam together to form a heavier atom? Combustion, fusion, fission or oxidation? Answer here is fusion. When two or more atoms are joined together to make a larger atom. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  This week, scientists with the U.S. Department of energy have reached a breakthrough in nuclear fusion for the first time ever in a lab setting, researchers say they generated more energy from a fusion reaction than they use to start the process. We're talking two or more atoms being fused together to form a larger one, and if scientists figure this out, fine tune it and harness this capability, we could potentially power our entire house from essentially a glass of water forever. This could help end dependence on fossil fuels. Talk about a game changer in the future of clean energy. We'll go now to CNN national correspondent Rene Marsh for more of the science behind the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RENE MARSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, scientists at a Department of Energy lab in California have figured out how to successfully produce a nuclear fusion reaction with a net energy gain. That means they've succeeded in taking two hydrogen atoms and using 192 powerful lasers to force those atoms to fuse together, unleashing the same kind of energy that powers the sun and stars. Until now, that has been incredibly difficult to replicate here on earth. The key is though that they've been able to release more energy from the reaction than they use in the fusion process itself and that's critically important. For anything to be a viable source it needs to have a higher energy output than the energy input used to generate the power. So this is a huge moment mostly because the discovery could eventually unlock an unlimited cheap, clean power source for the world. Now, this discovery has also proved this is a viable energy source and no longer a hypothetical scenario. But as major as this is in the quest to pivot away from dirty energy sources like fossil fuels, we're still a far away off from powering our homes by way of nuclear fusion it's estimated it could take two even three decades before this energy source is widely used. Rene Marsh, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  When hurricane Ian pummeled Florida in late September, it brought over $50 billion in damage to the state and tragically took lives of 148 people. It also had an unexpected consequence. It destroyed Florida's bee colonies. The colonies are used to pollinate the nation's agriculture. CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir spoke to Florida beekeepers about what this could mean. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Now you going to get a handful of bees. BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT:  Really? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes. WEIR:  OK. (voice-over):  I'm not usually in the habit of accepting a handful of stinging insects. But Keith Councell has a 40-year professional relationship with honeybees. And you never really wear a veil or gloves or anything? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't really need to. WEIR (voice over):  And these days, they need all the love they can get. Hurricane Ian arrived at the worst possible time for this business. Just as beekeepers from around the country were set up to catch the autumn bloom of the Brazilian peppertree. The storm drowned and crushed hundreds of thousands of hives, killing countless millions of bees. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's gone. You have to come back, right, nothing left. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You could actually see a water line where it came up to here. WEIR:  And because Ian blew away so much vegetation, those that survived are starving. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Some of these bees have going to get three shots of feed and that's a gallon. So you're talking about 36 pounds of feed already and you can still go back after they suck the feed down and it looks like they never were fed at all. WEIR:  They're just starving. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They're just starving. Yes, it's nonstop. So it's just an added cost and you're just trying to do the best you have to make that tough decision of really is it worth the money. The financial costs to try to save it or do you just have to walk away and take your medicine. WEIR:  This is all bee food. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This will be used for liquid bee food. Yeah. WEIR:  At Mann Lake Bee and Ag Supply, they're mixing sugar water as fast as they can. And while some bee farmers filed for federal relief, the Greater Good Charity is giving away a quarter ton of pollen substitute. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have donated meals to food pantries for humans. We've donated animal supplies to animal shelters. And now, we're donating this bee pollen substitute to these farmers here. WEIR:  Can't forget the bottom of the food chain, right? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, can't forget what helps get all the other food to the table as well. WEIR:  But even if their bees recover, the whole business depends on the health of the almond crop in California now shrinking under mega drought. If the drought takes out the almond crop in California that -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The whole beekeeping industry is going to be in trouble and there's no feral bees. There's no -- wild bees can't survive on their own. WEIR:  He explains the pesticides development and invasive pests have made it impossible for bees to survive without deliberate human care. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And if all the beekeepers released all of their bees, every beekeeper in the country, if they just released all their bees into the wild, we estimated about two to three years; the poor bees would just collapse. These are the most important farmer. They're the most forgotten as well. And that's why we just need the entire public to really continue to get involved in bees and a little -- two bee hives makes a big impact. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They went totally underwater, somehow made it. WEIR:  In the meantime, all Keith can do is pick up the pieces and focus on the survivors. Like the hive, he found drowned inside a water meter box near Fort Myers Beach. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's a different feeling and you have bees walking all over you. WEIR:  It really is. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And nobody's getting stung. Yes, they're doing their thing. WEIR:  Maybe they can sense we're rooting for him, you know? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, and that's part of the thing you have to treat him with respect. When you get down to it, the bees are the pillars to all agriculture. They're the pillars to our whole civilization. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: And up next, an adorable story for our 10 out of 10. The Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control has strict rules about what types of animals people can have in their yards but they were hit with cuteness overload when they got a letter from a six-year-old Madeline asking if they'd let her keep a unicorn in their backyard if she's able to catch one someday. Well, knowing that unicorns are notoriously difficult to find in Los Angeles the department went ahead and gave her a stuffed unicorn in the meantime along with a permanent unicorn license. Good luck, Madeline. All right special shout out to Valley View Junior High in Jonesboro, Arkansas. Go Blazers. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. Can you believe that we're fewer than three weeks until 2022 is over? Well, I can't wait to celebrate the New Year with you. I'm Coy Wire and this is CNN 10. END221215

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. It is Thursday. So, happy Friday eve. I'm your host Coy Wire. Grateful to be right here with you on CNN 10.  We're here to break down some top storylines in an upbeat and easy to understand manner. This is our penultimate show before we take a long holiday break just today and tomorrow. So let's make the most of them. First up, government officials in the United States are preparing for a surge of migrants along the country's southern border with Mexico. A December deadline to terminate a public health authority known as Title 42 is coming up. The policy was created at the start of the coronavirus pandemic and allowed officials to quickly turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border due to concerns over the spread of the virus.  Well, an end to that restriction is expected to lead to an increase in border crossings and members within both Democrat and Republican parties are raising concerns over whether officials should consider a new policy. President Biden's administration is already asking Congress for more than $3 billion in assistance as it prepares for the end of the Title 42 policy. And the influx of migrants has already started. U.S. border officials have been contending with thousands of migrants crossing the border daily and expect those numbers to increase in the coming days and weeks. Let's break this story down by the numbers.  Over the weekend, U.S. border authorities apprehended more than 16,000 people. In a single section of the border in El Paso, Texas, more than 2,400 migrants crossed into the United States each day. Many officials speculate that the end of the title policy could overwhelm an already strained system.  We'll hear now from CNN national correspondent Ed Lavendera in El Paso, Texas, with the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  As the sun fades away over El Paso, a large group of migrants stand on the borders edge waiting to be processed by border patrol agents. While a few others tiptoe across a short path through the Rio Grande.  These migrants are part of a major surge of border crossings seen in El Paso in recent days, and it is happening as the projected and of a Trump era restriction draws closer, ending the policy to swiftly expel migrants at the U.S. land borders.  U.S. border authorities interacted with more than 2 million migrants in the last year, up from the previous year. But in recent days, an average of almost 2,500 migrants a day have been moving across this border, between Mexico and the U.S. through El Paso.  CLAUDIA RODRIGUEZ, EL PASO CITY COUNCIL MEMBER:  Title 42 is only going to make that situation worse, they're going to have more apprehension, so we are going to see a lot more releases into the community, and we're not prepared for it.  LAVANDERA:  Just three weeks ago, according to Customs and Border Protection, the seven-day rolling average was fewer than 1,700. Thousands of migrants are now coming from Central and South America as well as Cuba, according to U.S. immigration officials.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm helping them get food, whatever they need. This is not even about politics. It's about humanity. These people are here and they are cold.  LAVANDERA:  Some have been camping out across the border in Ciudad Juarez, in Mexico, raising concerns they will cross in mass if Trump era border restrictions end about a week.  Still, others have already been boarded into buses to be processed or turned around under the provisions of Title 42.  JAKE SULLIVAN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  We are taking steps to be able to manage the expiration of Title 42 and to put in place a process that will be orderly and humane. We believe that in doing so we can protect our national security concerns.  LAVANDERA:  Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas arrived in El Paso today, and says he is meeting with Customs and Border Protection, local officials, and organizations.  For now, the immediate problem is housing, and managing a large influx of migrants.  RUBEN GARCIA, DIRECTOR, ANNUNCIATION HOUSE:  If the court cases get resolved, and the courts allow Title 42 to be lifted, we are going to see thousands of refugees for whom there isn't shelter.  LAVANDERA:  The director of a local El Paso shelter says border patrol recently dropped a busload of migrants at his doorstep. And he is worried he will soon have to turn people away.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're going to have to say no, not because we want to, but simply because we don't have space. The reality is, there's just too many people.  (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What is the most populated country in the world? Russia, China, United States or India? With an estimated 1.4 billion people, China edges out India as the most populated country in the world.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  As we've discussed, China is reopening its doors after three years of its zero COVID policy, the last country on the planet to do so. While the policy did keep spread of the virus low, it stressed the daily lives of citizens inside the country, with mandatory tests and quarantines. But now that many of the restrictions in China have been removed, by many accounts, the streets feel more empty than when's restrictions were there. Why? Because fear of the virus remains, in large part because coronavirus is spreading quickly in China. More now from CNN international correspondent Selina Wang who's on the scene in Beijing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  China is starting to unravel its zero COVID policy. But instead of crowds out celebrating, this is how reopening is going in China -- close shops, empty streets, people avoiding each other because for the first time since the start of the pandemic, COVID is spreading like wildfire in Beijing. People now either have COVID or they're scared to get it. So I just spoke to the shop worker in the store and he told me that he's the only employee without COVID which is why he can still come to work and he says, I am the only customer who has come into this store all day. The only crowds I'm seeing in Beijing outside of hospitals like this and pharmacies.  So he says his fever's gone down but he still has a cold, hoping to buy medicine but he's worried they don't have any stock because there's these long lines forming outside of pharmacies across the country people are trying to stock up but stuff is selling out.  You know, for years, China has been demonizing COVID, playing up the risks of long COVID and now suddenly state media is publishing headlines every day saying COVID is not a big deal. It's whiplash for a lot of people because just weeks before, if you got COVID, your whole community would have gone into hard lockdown. This is such a major and sudden change.  So China is finally opening up. How do you feel about it?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I feel is pretty great. I wish they could have opened up earlier. WANG:  Has business been very slow or difficult? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, you can see, there -- there are not that many customers. A lot of people just got the virus. WANG:  Are you scared about getting COVID? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm worried about my parents and my grandparents a little bit. WANG:  People are relieved though that you no longer have to go to a quarantined facility if you get COVID. Getting sent to one of those rundown facilities was such a big source of anxiety before. And these health QR codes that have been used for years to track and dictate where we can go -- well, the government is now saying that you don't need them to enter most public places. So I don't need to scan my code. It feels surreal though that I can literally just walk in. So she said I can only do online delivery. So you can't even sit inside or order inside in Shake Shack.  So outside the Starbucks, they have a sign saying you need to show a 40- hour COVID test, even though the national rules don't require it, in Beijing, you still need a recent PCR test in order to enter restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues. There are way less places now to get COVID tests in the city, and the lines are short because most people are just staying at home. But just a week before, at this exact same location, this was packed with people waiting in line. So behind me is a graveyard of COVID testing booths. It's like almost overnight in Beijing, they removed all of these testing locations and here's the remnants. After years of harsh lockdowns, the government is finally letting people manage their own health. But people don't feel ready and experts say the country isn't either. The country hasn't vaccinated enough of the elderly population and has it improved the health care capacity enough. So this reopening it's going to continue to be messy and uneven. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, a family from Gretna, Virginia, is an enlightened bunch who really know how to conduct themselves at Christmas time. Mike Clay says he used more than 30,000 lights to decorate his house and it lights up the entire street. Inspired by the movie "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation", he says he decorates in memory of his grandfather. His light bill jumps up by a hundred dollars though during the month but he says it's total really worth it. If loving Christmas is wrong, Mr. Clay don't want to be light because he loves Christmas a lots. Shout out to Clark Middle School in Anchorage, Alaska.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. You made it to Friday, and you already know Friday's rock. Now, this is a last show of 2022, and one thing making it extra special is that you helped write it. See if you can find your word that you sent me via social media sprinkled somewhere within.  I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. Let's finish this week's strong. We start with news on the economy, specifically the labor force. Employers need workers and that's good news. There's nearly two job openings for every job seeker. The shortage of workers in the United States has many employers ready to fight to retain talent. This is especially good for previously untapped labor populations where traditionally it was difficult to get a job.  And it also seems particularly good news for job-seeking women. The last jobs report revealed that 62 percent of the job gains last month went to women, narrowing the gap in labor force participation rate between men and women.  New data this week shows that middle-aged men ages 35 to 44 have been slow to rejoin labor force recently the participation rate for men ages to 30 to 44 is lower than it was before the pandemic. Economists say there are many reasons the male labor force participation rate is down, including changing needs and interests in the post-pandemic world.  We'll hear more now from CNN reporter Vanessa Yurkevich who has reported extensively on the labor market. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID SHNITZLER, AT-HOME DAD:  Good morning, Winston. Let's start the day.  YURKEVICH (voice over):  It's a typical day in the Shnitzler household. Seventeen month old Winston is up and parents David and Allison (ph) are getting ready for work. Winston is fed, there's some play, and then the morning good-byes.  ALLISON SHNITZLER, FAMILY PHYSICIAN:  Bye-bye. D. SHNITZLER:  Say bye-bye. YURKEVICH:  They're off to work. A. SHNITZLER:  Bye-bye. Have a good day. YURKEVICH:  Allison, a family physician, and David, an insurance underwriter, now an at-home dad.  D. SCHNITZLER:  Caring for Winston, tending to the house, playing with him, all of that comes first.  YURKEVICH:  Last year the Schnitzler's made a significant life change.  D. SCHNITZLER:  We made that decision to have me stay home.  YURKEVICH:  David quit his job to take care of Winston full time so Allison could continue her career.  D. SCHNITZLER:  We're happy with the roles that we're in. It's phenomenal.  YURKEVICH:  And in recent months, more men ages 30 to 44 have been dropping out of the workforce according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The labor force participation rate for men in that age group is lower than it was pre-pandemic.  RICHARD V. REEVES, SENOR FELLOW, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION:  I don't think it's a secret that many of us rethought our whole work life balance, what were we doing, who's raising the kids, how do we want our family to work? That's a question that a lot of families have been asking themselves. YURKEVICH:  And more women in recent months ages 30 to 44 are participating in the labor force and at a higher rate than pre- pandemic according to Labor Department data. And they're moving into more male dominated industries.  REEVES:  The fears of a she-cession turned out largely to be unfounded. Women are returning to the labor market. It's becoming increasingly common to see women, for example, having project management roles or generally management positions within construction.  YURKEVICH:  Women like Ava Sedaghat.  AVA SEDAGHAT, PROJECT ENGINEER:  I knew I wanted to work in construction management.  YURKEVICH:  Sedaghat joined the construction industry two years ago as a project engineer. Today, women make up just 14 percent of the construction industry, but it's the highest on record.  SEDAGHAT:  I think it was definitely intimidating. My only knowledge of the construction industry was that it was pretty heavy and male dominated. But the more that I started working in the industry and the more people I came into contact with, I think I realized pretty quickly on that there's a place for everyone in construction.  (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia:  The term "metaverse" was coined by: A science fiction writer, the founder of Facebook, a programmer at Google, or a college professor? In 1992, the term metaverse was coined by sci-fi writer Neal Stephenson.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ever since its inception, the metaverse has had many people flummoxed, even flabbergasted. Is it simply like a video game or could it evolve actually into a common way of life?  In the metaverse, you can virtually be transported from your couch to a classroom, from a living room to a work luncheon. You could walk alongside a hippopotamus on safari or wear a spinny hat and get rambunctious with friends at a concert by Bieber, Drake in the weekend, and you wouldn't even have to leave your room. While this technology is catching up with fantasy, it's still being built and is constantly evolving. CNN reporter Anna Stewart has more from Dubai. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN CORESPONDENT:  Remember this movie? The concept of a virtual universe is rooted in science fiction and for years, it's been just that fiction. But now, technology is beginning to catch up, bringing the idea of the metaverse to reality.  It's home to concerts, expensive digital real estate and hugely popular games. But what exactly is the metaverse? What does it do, and why should you care? Let's break it down. NEAL STEPHENSON, AUTHOR, SNOW CRASH:  It means a virtual environment. STEWART:  This is Neal Stephenson. He came up with a term metaverse back in 1992. For his book "Snow Crash". Back to you Neal. STEPHENSON:  Where large numbers of people can get together and interact with each other, not as they are but through avatars, which are kind of the three-dimensional representations. STEWART:  For so long, our experiences with the Internet have been 2D, it's been something we look at. But the metaverse gives users the sense of being transported into the Internet like this.  Oh hi. ANDREW BOSWORTH, CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER, META:  Hello. STEWART:  Meet Andrew Bosworth, also known as Boz. He works at Meta, formerly named Facebook. Great.  Do we shake hands? How does this work? BOSWORTH:  We can do a high five.  STEWART:  This is Horizon Workrooms, the company's foothold in the metaverse. It's just one of the many ways into the metaverse that are currently available. In these virtual worlds, you can play games, do business and dance with strangers that turn into friends, except that this friend could be on the other side of the world. BOSWORTH:  Is it as good as being together? No, and it probably never will be, but it's the next best thing. STEWART:  This all sounds exciting, until you realize that the technology for building this new iteration of the Internet is -- well, still being built. For now, it's this place where you can be whoever you want and immerse your virtual self into this alternative world that pushes past physical barriers, to collaborate and interact with other virtual avatars, objects and environments.  As promising as it all may sound, we still have a long way to go before we're living like this.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello from Buffalo, everyone. It's your boy Coy and we have missed you. We hope the start of your New Year has been full of love and positive energy. I know we're feeling it now that we are back. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start with a remarkable story that has transpired here in Buffalo, New York, this past week. Bills' player Damar Hamlin was tragically injured, suffering cardiac arrest in the first quarter of their game last Monday. And in an unprecedented move, Bills players and head coach Sean McDermott refused to play on. In the past, games have always played on, but these NFL players prioritize their mental health over the outcome of the game.  Hamlin spent the following days in critical condition but eventually showed enough progress to surprise the team with a video called days before their final regular season game. The team said that's all they needed. The game was magical. Bills head coach Sean McDermott said it was going to be a celebration of life, the power of three, Damar's jersey number was everywhere. Then, powerful moment, the medical workers and training staff who pounced in with poise and precision to save Damar Hamlin's life walk to midfield getting an ovation as big as any we've ever heard. Then, game time. And on the opening play, the Bills first since the tragic injury goosebumps, when Nyheim Hines took the kickoff back for a touchdown. It had been three years and three months since the Bills had done that before. Bills star quarterback Josh Allen said it was spiritual, bone chilling, and Damar Hamlin watching from the hospital tweeted: God behind all this no coincidence. Buffalo would go on to win 35-23. Here's star offensive lineman Dion Dawkins on what he's learned through all of this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DION DAWKINS, BUFFALO BILLS:  No second, no breath, no event, no situation is promised. It could be a drastic this or this at any moment. And I have truly learned to be a better father, to be a better partner, to be a better person. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Remember lovely people, we can find strength through our struggles, find heroes through heartache. The world has come together to support Damar Hamlin. His GoFundMe charity to raise money to buy toys for kids originally set out to raise twenty five hundred dollars. It has skyrocketed to more than $8.5 million so far. All right. Next up, we're bringing you to Washington, D.C. with an update on what's happening in the U.S. Congress. Every time a new political party gains the majority in the House of Representatives, a new speaker of the House is elected. The speaker is in charge of the House's legislative agenda, its committee assignments, and deciding on voting procedures.  Democrat Nancy Pelosi stepped down from her role as speaker of the House in November following the U.S. midterm elections where Republicans won back control of the House. This week, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy was elected speaker, but it wasn't easy. McCarthy made numerous concessions over the course of many days before he finally earned a majority and was elected on the 15th round of voting.  To secure the gavel, McCarthy and his allies overcame opposition from a group of conservative critics within the Republican Party. It was the longest contest in 164 years. Many Republicans fear this may make it harder to govern in the future while Democrats who voted unanimously for their candidate, the minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, were happy to see what many called chaos for the opposing party. More now from politics reporter Eva McKend who has more on the proceeding from the nation's capital. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER:  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy securing a victory at long last by picking off his detractors one by one, doing so through making some key concessions. Namely, it will require only one member to trigger a vote that could potentially lead to ousting the House speaker. Take a listen to what McCarthy had to say after the vote. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Don't judge us on how we start, watch how we finish. And I think by having the disruption now really built the trust with one another and learned how to work together. What we're going to have to find in our mindset is that we have to front load that we have to think about and work on the bills with a microcosm of the conference before we even start writing it and that's really what we learned here. MCKEND:  So you can hear McCarthy there really striking in optimistic tone Republicans have done so as well, arguing that this week really illustrated that this is what democracy looks like. That sometimes it is messy -- well, Democrats, they have a different view. They say that the chaotic episodes that played out on the House floor time and time again really illustrate that Republicans are not prepared to govern.  They will face another key test. This new Republican leadership on Monday when they have to vote on a House rules package. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Okay. Yesterday, President Joe Biden made his first trip in office to the U.S.-Mexico border where he visited El Paso, Texas. This follows a major immigration policy announcement by the president who visited the border Sunday for a first-hand view of the border enforcement operation. Biden has faced backlash in recent months from both Democrats in his own party and Republicans who believe he has not managed immigration issues well while in office. Democrats condemn recent immigration policies as human rights violations while Republicans say the president has not done enough to limit border crossing amid recent surge.  We'll hear now from Arlette Saenz, a CNN White House correspondent based in D.C. who has more on the details of the visit. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  El Paso, Texas, a city that has seen a surge in migrants in recent weeks. Officials here at the White House say the president wants to see get an assessment of the border security situation on the ground there, and he will meet and hear from officials with Customs and Border Protection. The president will also be joined on this trip by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.  And officials have also said he the president wants to learn more about the efforts to stem fentanyl flow into the country.  Now, this all comes as the president has faced pressure not just to visit the border but also address these issues regarding the border, as it has quickly become a political liability for President Biden. The Texas governor, a Republican, Greg Abbott, said that it's about time that President Biden paid that visit down to the U.S.-Mexico border.  But on the other hand, the president has also accused Republicans of engaging in demagoguery, saying that they need to come to the table to pass comprehensive immigration reform which this White House says is the only way to fully ease these issues relating to the border.

Answer is: the smallest and shallowest ocean on earth is the Arctic Ocean. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next up, a snowy owl normally found in the Arctic tundra shows up 3,000 miles away amid palm trees and beaches of sunny southern California. The extremely rare sighting has transfixed a California community, but as for how the owl arrived there, who-who could know? Maybe CNN reporter Jeanne Moos. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It's a head scratcher, all right, how did a snowy owl that normally lives in the Arctic tundra end up amid the palm trees of southern California? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I consider an honor to be able to see the bird. MOOS:  Bird lovers are flocking to Cypress, California, to get a peek. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That's so exciting. I see a bird that does not belong here. MOOS:  Yeah. Well, not everyone is excited. JARET DAVEY, WETLANDS AND WILDLIFE CARE CENTER:  There were all these crows that were just dive bombing it and trying to like scare it away and the owl was just unfazed. MOOS:  Not so unfazed, the birder who posted this video Nicholas Belardes admits, "I teared up". A marine biologist told "The New York Times" it's like seeing Santa Claus on a beach.  Wildlife experts are watching the owl like a hawk, even to the point of climbing up a ladder to retrieve a pellet regurgitated by the raptor. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh so a treasure right away. MOOS:  The birds expel the indigestible parts of their meals, so the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center decided to check on the owl's taste in California cuisine. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This looks like the skull. Yeah, look at that, the skull of some kind of rodent. MOOS:  We know what it ate but we don't know how it got here. Is it an escaped illegal pet? Or did it hitch a ride on a freighter from up north? Or maybe it just got disoriented and flew too far south? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It looks nice and fluffy. MOOS:  Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, still here in Buffalo, New York. Yesterday, I told you about the remarkable story of the Buffalo Bills who rallied in their final game of the regular season for their injured teammate Damar Hamlin who suffered cardiac arrest during their game last week. Well, I am happy to report that Damar has been released from the hospital in Cincinnati and is back in Buffalo. So some encouraging news to start our day. All right. We've got a big show for you but only 10 minutes to do it, so let's get to it. We start with the latest news from Brazil. Political unrest gripping the streets of Brazil this week. Supporters of the country's former president, Jair Bolsonaro, storming official buildings in the capitol to protest what they believe was a stolen election. The election was narrowly won by former Brazilian President Lula da Silva, who first served in the role from 2003 to 2011.  But Bolsonaro encouraged supporters to question the country's electronic voting system. Over one thousand people were arrested for protesting. Bolsonaro supporters have been camping out in tent cities ever since the election back in October.  The new president will face major challenges early on as divisions in the country feel profound. More now from CNN's Rafael Romo, a senior Latin American affairs editor of CNN worldwide.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR:  Brazil boiling over. Supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro stormed key buildings in the country's capital Sunday breaching security barriers and temporarily occupying the country's Congress, presidential palace and Supreme Court.  Masses of protesters flooded the country's seat of power, many dressed in the colors of Brazil's flag yellow and green, fueled by anger and distrust over Bolsonaro's defeat in a runoff election last October where he lost by less than two percentage points to current President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva.  Protesters threw objects and scaled the roofs of buildings, while clashing with police who responded with tear gas. At least one protester was seen sitting at the desk of Brazil's congress president.  CNN Brazil reports the floor of the Congress building was flooded after the sprinkler system activated when protesters attempted to set fire to the carpet. By evening, police began dispersing the rioters from buildings and arrested hundreds of people who were detained in buses before being taken to the police station. President Lula Da Silva who was inaugurated just a week ago described the events as barbaric and vowed to punish the people responsible. LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Those people that we call fascists. We call them everything that's abominable in politics. They invaded the government headquarters,. and they invaded the Congress like vandals, destroying everything in their path. ROMO:  President Lula da Silva also blamed his predecessor for the lack of security in the capital where Bolsonaro's supporters have been camped out for over a week. Bolsonaro who is currently in Florida denounced what he called the depredations and invasions of public buildings in a tweet, adding that peaceful and lawful demonstrations are part of democracy.  But critics say Bolsonaro may have stirred up the crowds by repeatedly saying without evidence that he questioned the integrity of the country's electronic voting system. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: After China, India, and the United States, which country has the highest population? Pakistan, Russia, Indonesia or Mexico? Home to over 275 million people, the fourth most populated country in the world is the archipelago of Indonesia. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next, we're traveling to the province of Bali, Indonesia, where Bali is facing a water crisis. Once clean water is dirty from tourism development, population growth and water mismanagement. While Bali sees a lot of rain, water shortages are already impacting Bali's culture and the people's quality of life, and experts warn the situation will worsen if water control practices aren't properly implemented. Let's go now to Bali to learn more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The Indonesian province Bali is known for its rich culture, breathtaking natural beauty and rain, lots of rain. But while tourism took a hit during the COVID-19 pandemic, a five-month rainy season doesn't stop millions from visiting the island in a typical year. And for those who live here, the seasonal deluge serves as a reminder of an ongoing water crisis. In fact, one innovative local school has made the stuff of life the centerpiece of its curriculum. LESLIE MEDEMA, HEAD OF CAMPUS, GREEN SCHOOL BALI:  We chose water as a theme for last year and this year because despite what everybody thinks, there's a water shortage in Bali. We have rains for months and months and months, and they fill the reservoirs but very, very quickly those reservoirs run dry. WEIR:  More tourists and residents take a dramatic toll on the island's natural water resources, but that's not the only concern. MEDEMA:  Just in the last 10 years, many, many villages have been noticing their once clean water has turned very, very dirty, and no longer usable. We've noticed a very serious water crisis arising in a place where that really shouldn't be the case. WEIR:  Tucked away in a forested patch miles inland from the southern beaches, the Green School Bali was built to create the next generation of problem solvers. MEDEMA:  Currently on campus, there are student-led projects that have been activated. WEIR:  Built from bamboo and other sustainable material, the impressive open-air facilities were designed to inspire imagination and creativity, each structure a base for what the school's founders call a living curriculum. MEDEMA:  The point is to be part of reimagining education, to be something that inspires action-based learning now all across the globe.  WEIR:  We are cultivating an optimistic, thoughtful and positive approach to climate and climate action. We want them to feel hopeful. We want them to feel like they have the skills, they have the ability to engage proactively in the world. After a group of students became fascinated with biofuels, the school created a network of bio buses, each running on used cooking oil refined by science. MEDEMA:  You're looking at a really wide-ranging learning experience from enterprise to marketing to management because it became its own company and the largest biofuel transportation company in Indonesia. WEIR:  Dipta is an 11th grader driven to find solutions by the desperate need close to home. DIPTA, STUDENT, GREEN SCHOOL BALI:  It starts off personally, right? The problem comes off from my hometown Kintamani, we didn't have enough water and then after that realizing that also a lot of other people don't have access to clean and drinkable water. He launched Liquify, a non-profit with a mission to provide sustainable filtration systems, help residents build recharge wells that replenish aquifers, and water catchment systems to collect rainfall for other uses.  DIPTA:  The innovation hub that we have at green school gives me the tools to create what I need to create, what I want to create, and to help me help other people as well. The Green School Bali opened in 2008 and now includes locations in New Zealand, South Africa and Mexico. MEDEMA:  Our mission is a community of learners making our world sustainable. And so when you put community back at the center of a school, you end up being more accountable for the actions that you take and I think that's a good thing. It's the full spectrum of local to global action-based environmental learning. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEIR:  And for today's "10 out of 10", a family in Plainville, Connecticut, could barely believe what they discovered in their backyard. Their dog started acting all nervous one day and they soon learned a black bear was hibernating under their deck.  After contacting their local environmental agency for advice, the family decided to do the bare minimum. They're going to grin and bear it and have a backyard slumber party all winter, just let the big fellas news I guess and hibernate. And around mid-March though, old sleepy is going to wake up and the first thing bears typically do is they search for food so look out doggy. All right. Dad joke alert: what do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear. All right. Time for our special shout out today. Madison County High School in Madison, Florida. Go Cowboys!

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. I wonderful Wednesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we've got a rendezvous with the news. Still here in Buffalo, New York, outside of Buffalo General Hospital, and yet another positive update on Bills player Damar Hamlin who suffered cardiac arrest during a game last week. Hospital officials have told us doctors are optimistic that Damar could be well enough to go home in the coming days and his parents are here in Buffalo reunited alongside their son. So wonderful, wonderful news. Next up today, a prominent research group in Washington recently conducted a war game simulation of a possible conflict. It's one that's preoccupied military and political leaders in Asia and across the world. The scenario would be an invasion by China against Taiwan. Taiwan is a democratically ruled island of 24 million people that the Chinese Communist Party believes belongs to their sovereign territory. The Center for Strategic and International Studies ran the program as software that it claims is one of the most extensive war game simulations ever conducted on a possible conflict over Taiwan. The company believes the project was necessary because previous government and private company war simulations have focused too narrowly on the possible way events in an invasion might unfold and weren't specific enough on how to help the government and policymakers try to prepare for how a potential conflict may play out. Let's go to Washington now to hear from CNN Pentagon correspondent Oren Liebermann who has details from the results of the simulations. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Taiwan is perhaps the most sensitive flash point between the U.S. and China. Some experts are warning that Beijing's use of force to claim what it sees as its rightful territory is drawing closer. Chairman Xi Jinping has made it a priority for Beijing which hasn't ruled out the use of force, a decision that could cost thousands of lives for China, Taiwan, and America. A war game from the Center for Strategic and International Studies begins with a Chinese missile barrage against Taiwan's military in 2026, destroying much of its air force and navy, followed by an amphibious across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwanese forces fight back using advanced U.S. weaponry -- Patriot missiles for air defense, anti-ship missiles and torpedoes for sea defense, and its ground forces to defend the beachheads. The top U.S. general says the key to avoiding conflict is deterrence. GEN. MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF:  As long as we remain number one, then we will deter the war that people worry about, a great power war between China and the United States. LIEBERMANN:  Crucially, this war game doesn't ask the question of what would happen to make China decide to use military force to invade Taiwan. That remains an open question. But it's a crucial one to understanding the situation, especially given the West's reaction to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, sanctions that have crippled Russia's economy. Would China run the same risk given its own imports and exports, given its industrial economic power, or would it use those powers to try to control Taiwan without using its military? And that is a critical question. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: "Flindrikin" and "unbrak" are words used in Scotland to describe what? Food, snow, hairstyles or movies? There are over 400 words in Scotland for snow with flindrikin, meaning a light snow. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE: Right now, those words for snow aren't being used much and that's because it's shorts weather across large parts of Europe right now. Thousands of temperature records were shattered in an historic winter warm spell. In fact, temperatures are 18 to 36 degrees higher than average this month. In Poland, it's up to about 66 degrees, parts of Spain about 77 degrees. This is good news for the economy but bad news for Russia who hoped cutting energy exports to Europe would cause the economy to suffer. But it's not all good news. Many Alpine ski resorts have closed or at least partially shut down because of a lack of snow, and there's also concern about what this higher than normal weather means for the environment. Up next, we'll hear from CNN anchor and correspondent Isa Soares who's on the ground in Europe with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The New Year may have only just begun, but temperatures are already heating up across much of Europe. At least eight countries smashed their winter weather record, having recorded their warmest day ever in January. As the world rang in New Year's celebrations this week, climatologists were busy tracking extreme temperatures and found countries including Poland, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Lichtenstein and Belarus all reached alarmingly warm temperatures on January the 1st. Meteorologists say it's too early to attribute the extreme heat to climate change but do say the driving force is a warm air mass from Africa's west coast moving across Europe. It may look warm in the Spanish city of Bilbao, but locals are noticeably wearing winter coats, basking in the winter sun. EUSEBIO FOLGEIRA, BILBAO, SPAIN, RESIDENT (through translator):  It's not normal for Bilbao to have such good weather. It always rains a lot here. It's very cold, and it's January. And it feels like summer. SOARES:  And what would normally be covered in snow, this ski resort in France is now starved of it, forcing businesses to shut their doors to customers until conditions improve. GREGORY ROMANO, RESTAURANT MANAGER (through translator):  Sure we are, of course, a little bit sad about having to close. We had a good Christmas holiday season, which matters. SOARES:  Over in war torn Ukraine, with much of the country's energy infrastructure damaged or destroyed, millions of Ukrainians were without power over Christmas. The cities across the country, including Kyiv, broke weather records in January, which may have helped reduce energy consumption. As Ukrainian advisor Anton Gerashchenko put at it, even the weather is on our side. Just before the year came to an end, the U.K.'s Met office said last year sweltering heat, which ran rivers dry and caused a drought in parts of England, was the country's hottest on record. Though January's mild temperatures might provide some relief to the cold, meteorologists warn it could offer a glimpse of a concerning and possibly even warmer future. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, a vast array of new cutting edge technology and some just plain strange technology were shown off by companies at the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas last week. Many inventions offered a new twist on old problems and global challenges. CNN international anchor Lynda Kinkade has the story and as you watch, think about what your favorite gadget is and let me know why @CoyWire wire on social. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LYNDA KINKADE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Thousands of emerging startups and global brands are showcasing cutting edge gadgets and gizmos designed to help solve some of the world's greatest challenges from the day to day to the life-saving by taking the guesswork out of testing the ripeness of an avocado relieve anxiety with a therapeutic cat pillow that wags. SHUNSUKE AOKI, PRESIDENT & CEO, YUKAI ENGINEERING:  The more you cuddle, it -- the more excited it gets. KINKADE:  Health innovations are prominently featured, trying to brain scanning helmet that claims to detect early signs of dementia and Parkinson's. Rest your head on a pillow designed to give a better night's sleep, and watch a demo of an at-home defibrillator, a device that the company says saved 17 lives last year. JOHANN KALCHMA, CEO, LIFEAZ:  But we have developed the first life-saving defibrillator made for the home, so anyone can have it at home. It's extremely simple to use. It's portable; you can have it at home. You can have it in your backpack when you do the gym, when you go on vacation. KINKADE:  Glide past the booths on a remote controlled pair of electric rollerblades that can go about 30 kilometers an hour. And check out an autonomous wheelchair that hopes to soon transport travelers to their gate at the airport with a click of a button. JUSTIN GAGNON, VP OF SALES AND MARKETING, WHILL, INC.:  So it's an autonomous wheelchair, so passenger will get into the chair, select what gate they're going to be going to and then the chair just takes them directly to that gate. They don't need to drive it. They don't need to tell it where it needs to go. It'll just take them right there. KINKADE:  Cars have become a big part of CES, with major automakers and others showcasing cutting edge advancements and nearly 300 exhibitors expected. It will be one of the largest auto shows in the world. This year there will also be a lot of talk about web 3 and the Metaverse. So as with most of what you'll find, it will take a while before all these gadgets become widely available. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, we have a story that's going to rocket your world. Check out this rocket ride high into the skies above.

OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Hope your Thursday is off to a fantastic start. I'm Omar Jimenez, a CNN national correspondent based in New York, and I'm filling in for the one and only Coy rest of the week. We're going to be covering extreme weather in California and looking at the potential impact of social media on teens.  But first, we're going to start with news from the sky. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a short ground stop yesterday of all domestic planes after there was an outage to a system that provides pilots with notices they need before flying. Now normal operations resumed later yesterday morning, but delays from the ground stop continued into the day.  When we recorded our show on Wednesday, there were more than flight delays nationwide. The airports in Chicago, O'Hare International and Midway International Airports, were especially impacted and they continued to have a ground stop for all inbound and outbound flights into the day on Wednesday.  Now, the specific system experiencing the outage is called the notice to air missions which alerts it's about closed runways equipment outages and potential hazards along a flight route or at a location that could impact flight. The Biden administration and secretary of transportation, Pete Buttigieg, are looking into what caused this disruption and if you saw over Christmas, Southwest Airlines canceled thousands of flights stranding tens of thousands of travelers. The federal government is zeroing in on Southwest and their system to figure out how to prevent future issues like these. All right. Ten-second trivia:  Name the third largest U.S. state whose state motto is eureka.  Is it Texas, Alaska, California, or Montana? And meaning "I have found it", eureka is the state motto of California. Up next, we're headed to California where residents across the state are recovering from deadly storms that brought area rainfall totals 400 percent to 600 percent above average. The storm meant heavy downpours and strong winds forcing thousands of evacuations. Response crews were responsible for clearing flooded neighborhoods and crumbled roadways and at least people have died as a result.  Also, more than million people are under flood alerts this week and it's not over yet. Another round of rain is on the way. It's the first of four more atmospheric river events. But what does that mean? Atmospheric rivers are long, narrow regions in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles. They're expected to hit California in the next 10 days. So we'll hear now from Kyung Lah, a national correspondent for CNN based in Los Angeles. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  During recent historic droughts, California prayed for rain, but not like this.  Two days of torrential rain, thunderstorms, and wind gusts are pounding California, causing mudslides, overflowing rivers, and triggering extensive flooding.  LYNDA HOPKINS, SUPERVISOR, SONOMA COUNTY:  We've got trees down. We've got mudslides. We've got actually folks trapped in areas where we have major road failures.  LAH:  At least 17 people have died as a result of the storms, after more than 18 inches of rain fell in parts of southern California. And high wind advisories were issued on the central coast.  In San Francisco, a rare hailstorm in Haight-Ashbury. And throughout northern California -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The rain hammered here pretty bad.  LAH:  -- the rushing river has flooded, following torrential downpours. Some residents have been without power for a week. In Santa Barbara County, mass evacuations, after that storm saturated the ground. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was pouring, the wind was whipping.  LAH:  Following years of extreme drought and fires.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On the mountainside here, the debris started coming down, filling up to four feet or so. Pretty much buried the truck, and now it's starting to flow.  LAH:  More than 30 million people are under flood alerts, and across southern California, flash flooding trapped drivers. Firefighters here rescued a motorist stranded in rushing waters. And mud and rockslides creating havoc for residents.  TYRONNE MCGRATH, RESIDENT, CASITAS SPRING:  A 800-pound rock just smashed the house, it just hit the wall and blew everything out.  LAH:  In northern California, the rain flooded roads, and vineyards, it almost doubled the snow pack in local mountains, offering hope that these storms may somehow ease California's historic drought.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're riding through it. Yeah, it could be a lot worse.  (END VIDEOTAPE) LAH (on camera):  It's hard to think about drought when this is what southern California is dealing with. I'm standing on a roadway that goes back behind, me you cannot see it because of all the debris on this road. This came from this mountain, this hillside five years ago burned in a wildfire. And with all the rain and lack of vegetation, it all came down onto the street and into these yards.  The concern now is what happens in the upcoming days, with rain in the forecast.  JIMENEZ:  Up next, we'll hear from Vanessa Yurkevich, a CNN business and politics reporter, who recently took a look at social media, specifically TikTok's impact on teen brains. Her reporting focuses on social media usage and the rate of depression especially among Gen Z users. Her research comes as more than a dozen state governments have actually banned TikTok on government-issued devices and at least 22 states have taken some sort of action on TikTok since 2020.  So let's hear more about her research in the teens she speaks with on the ground. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS REPORTER (voice-over):  In just five years, TikTok has amassed more than one billion global users. Eyeballs around the world glued to the endless content and viral videos. How long do you think you spend on TikTok every day? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Two to three hours. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Three to four hours. YURKEVICH:  But last month, the U.S. government, along with more than a dozen states, banned TikTok on most federal devices, citing national security concerns over its Chinese parent company and the possibility it could pressure TikTok to hand over personal data.  There is no public evidence the Chinese government has done that but there is evidence of another risk, social media's impact on mental health particularly among Gen Z. DR. JEAN TWENGE, PSYCHOLOGIST:  Teen depression started to rise after 2012. So did self-harm. YURKEVICH:  Dr. Gene Twenge says as smartphones and social media grew, so did the rate of depression among teens, nearly doubling between 2004 and 2019. By that year, one in four U.S. teen girls had experienced clinical depression according to Twenge.  TWENGE:  What the algorithms trying to do is get people able to use the app for longer because that's how the company makes more money. YURKEVICH:  TikTok in a statement said, quote, one of our most important commitments is supporting the safety and well-being of teens and we recognize this work is never finished. We continue to focus on robust safety protections for our community while also empowering parents with additional controls for their teen's account through TikTok family pairing. Users of TikTok spent an average of an hour and a half a day on the app last year, more than any other social platform. What is it that keeps you scrolling even if you know maybe you've spent one two hours on it? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Once you watch the one video, you're like, well, time to watch another. So you just keep doing it's like a cycle you don't realize that the time is passing.  YURKEVICH:  That's exactly what happened to Jerome Yankee (ph). UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I've definitely done all-nighters on TikTok before I had just been scrolling until the sun came up. YURKEVICH:  He says he lost sleep. His grades suffered. He lost touch with his friends. He lost his sense of self. In 2021, he deleted the app. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Getting disappointed by my own life is never something I want to be doing, especially when I have the power to change it but I just wasn't because I was spending hours on this app. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have like a lot of cool resources that we give to our audience for free. YURKEVICH:  But Hannah Williams (ph) proves the positive side of TikTok, allowing her to create a business, Salary Transparent Street, providing paid transparency to her new nearly million followers. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think TikTok definitely helped just because they have such audience reach potential. YURKEVICH:  She hopes TikTok's algorithm works in her favor. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Helping people in marginalized communities is the only reason I am doing this. It's my entire mission. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ:  Up next for today's 10 out of 10, we're showing you a volcano that's erupt to no good. Yeah, even I've got to get in on the puns here. Come on. Check out this time lapse video of the Kilauea volcano erupting in Hawaii the time lapse shows smoke and lava flowing all captured by the U.S. geological survey there's something truly so beautiful about this, so hot, the temperature. As you can see the lava cooling on the surface and forming crustal plates it's fascinating science happening right in front of our eyes. Last up on the show today, you know, we got to do it. I want to give a special shout out to Kennesaw Mountain High School in Kennesaw, Georgia. That's where I went. Go Mustangs. It's been amazing hanging out with you all today. I'm Omar Jimenez. This is CNN 10. Have a great Thursday. END230113

OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. I'm Omar Jimenez, filling in for Coy Wire today. We made it to Friday. It is Friday the 13th, but Friday nonetheless. And you already know Fridays are amazing. This is CNN 10 and I'm so excited to be right here with you. Let's finish this week strong. Now, we're going to start today with the news in Washington. Classified documents belonging to President Joe Biden have been found in areas that are not authorized to store classified files. The documents which have classified markings were found at two locations inside his home in Wilmington, Delaware. Now, the files were found along with personal and political papers. The search for these documents started after similar classified docs were found at a private office of the president back in November. Now, the paperwork is from his time as vice president in the Obama administration and Biden said the documents were in a locked garage, that he was cooperating fully with the Department of Justice. Now some of the classified documents were top secret at the highest level. They were found within boxes that also contain unclassified papers that fall under the Presidential Records Act, but key questions remain unanswered about the nature of the material, including who brought these documents and what's contained in them. Last year, more than 335 documents were found at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residents, 60 of which were top secret. Republicans in Congress have accused Biden and the Justice Department of a double standard. Now, Donald Trump is under investigation for obstruction of justice for refusing to return the documents or at least turn them over. As of Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to look into an official Biden documents probe. Now, we're going to hear from CNN senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid who has more details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  People know I take classified documents -- classified information seriously. PAUL REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  President Biden Tuesday denied any prior knowledge of classified information uncovered late last year in a space he used while working for the University of Pennsylvania before he became president. BIDEN:  We want this to be a gathering place. REID:  CNN has learned that among the items discovered were 10 classified documents dated between 2013 and 2016, including U.S. intelligence memos and briefings materials that covered topics including Ukraine, Iran and the United Kingdom. CNN has reported that some of the materials included top secret files. BIDEN:  I was briefed about this discovery and surprised to learn that there are any government records that were taken there to that office. REID:  They were found in three or four boxes that also contained unclassified papers that fall under the Presidential Records Act, a source tells CNN. The vast majority of the boxes held personal Biden family documents, including materials about Beau Biden's funeral arrangements and condolence letters. The documents were discovered November 2nd, just six days before the midterm elections. Republicans pounced, launching investigations, comparing the discovery to former President Trump's retention of hundreds of classified documents and slamming Democrats. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  They have to eat their words but the hypocrisy -- think about this -- they've gotten away with so much for so long. This was discovered before the last election. REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA):  So if then Vice President Biden took classified documents with him and held them for years and criticized president -- former President Trump during that same time that he had those classified documents and only after it was uncovered did he turn him back. REID:  Even Trump's estranged former vice president weighed in. MIKE PENCE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT:  The handling of classified materials, a very serious issue for our nation and we ought to take it seriously. But there ought to be equal treatment under the law. REID:  But Democrats are defending Biden against any such comparison. REP. PETE AGUILAR (D-CA):  What President Biden did was disclose this to the Archives, let law enforcement know. That is exactly the way that you should handle this. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ:  All right. Ten-second trivia: Which of these historic figures was given the name "Michael" when he was born in 1929? Martin Luther King, Jr., Michael Jordan, Mark Twain, Thurgood Marshall? Michael King Jr., that was the birth name of the civil rights leader born in Atlanta, Georgia. This Monday, we celebrate the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. He was a Baptist minister and activist, and one of the most prominent leaders in the civil rights movement. King called for civil and economic rights, and an end to racism in the United States. Monday is a national holiday and we won't have an episode of our show that day. So, CNN's Dana Bash filed the following report on Dr. King's legacy on the 50th anniversary of his death. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  This is unbelievable. You look up there, it says Mason Temple, this is where Martin Luther King 50 years ago gave his incredible Mountaintop speech. SUBTITLE:  April 2, 1968, King gave an emotional speech at the Mason Temple in Memphis. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER:  I just want to do God's will. And he has allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land! BASH (voice-over):  That night, April 3rd, 1968, King checked in here, to Lorraine Motel. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He gets dressed around 5:45 and he steps outside of the balcony of room 306, and he speaks to other guests that are in the courtyard. SUBTITLE:  April 4, approximately 6:01 p.m., King was shot while standing on this motel balcony. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  At approximately 6:01, the final shot rings out. Dr. King lies mortally wounded on the balcony. He's taken from the balcony to St. Joseph's Hospital and he's pronounced dead at 7:05 p.m. SUBTITLE:  On the night of King's assassination, President Lyndon B. Johnson addressed the nation. LYNDON B. JOHNSON, FORMER PRESIDENT: Shocked and saddened by the brutal slaying tonight of Dr. Martin Luther King. I ask every citizen to reject the blind violence that has struck Dr. King, who lived by nonviolence. SUBTITLE:  Fifty years later, a bipartisan group of members of Congress visited the site where MLK Jr. was assassinated. REP. KEITH ELLISON (D), MINNESOTA:  To me, it's like a return into something rudimentary and fundamental. I mean, this is where Martin Luther King breathed his last breath. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In honor of, Lorraine Hotel decided not to recheck this room out in Dr. King's honor and remembrance. BASH:  This is exactly how it was left? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was left this way. BASH:  Right there when it all happened, King's partner and dear friend, Reverend Ralph Abernathy, his wife Juanita on this pilgrimage 50 years later. The night that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, you were with his widow. JUANITA ABERNATHY, FRIEND OF KING FAMILY:  Yes. BASH:  Tell me about that. ABERNATHY:  I told Coretta, I said, well, I'll meet you in your house, and I stayed there that night with her -- BASH:  So, did you sleep with her in her bed to comfort her? ABERNATHY:  Yes, right? BASH:  The night that her husband was killed? ABERNATHY:  The night that he died, I slept on his side of the bed and my little children were there with her children. (SINGING) BASH:  Tell me how you're feeling. I was watching you standing here. REP. JOHN LEWIS (D), GEORGIA:  Well, you know, it's very emotional to come here. I was not here that evening. He changed my life.  He inspired me to stand up, to speak up and to never give up. And when he died, I think something died in all of us. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ:  And lastly, we can't go until we do it, I want to give a special shout-out to Western Middle School in Auburn, Michigan. It's been such a pleasure getting to host CNN 10 for all of you. The show meant a lot to me when I was in high school. My first ever interaction with CNN was actually visiting this program and so it's a real full circle moment for me to be back here hosting for all of you. Hope your week was awesome. Have a great weekend and I hope to see you soon. END230116

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Terrific Tuesday to you. I hope you had a wonderful weekend and a marvelous Martin Luther King Jr. Day yesterday. I am back. My voice mostly back. Thanks for all the love and well wishes on my Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok. And special thanks to the Army JROTC program at Klein Cain High School in Klein, Texas. The Hurricane Battalion sent this lovely letter, and they also sent their school colors and their pride in the form of this tie. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, and we start with the dilemma over the rapidly approaching debt ceiling for the United States government. What's the debt ceiling? It's the limit the total amount of money that the U.S. government has authorized to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations, which include Social Security, Medicare benefits, military salaries, interest on national debt and tax refunds. That credit limit currently sits at about $31.3 trillion. Now, the debt ceiling can be raised, and it has been for decades hits the massive current debt. It was last raised in December of 2021, and is expected to last until at least July of this year. Well, this has set up a major battle on Capitol Hill between the Republican and Democratic Parties. Can the two sides agree to terms on which the debt ceiling could be raised again? Here's CNN anchor and chief business correspondent Christine Romans with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  We'd like to get a debt ceiling done in this work period. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  So, when it comes to the debt ceiling, it should not -- it should not be used or never be a matter of political brinksmanship. JANET YELLEN, SECRETARY OF TREASURY:  It's really up to Congress to raise the debt ceiling. CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Ah, the debt ceiling, the eternal Washington food fight. So what is it? And why is it so contentious? The debt ceiling is the legal limit set by Congress on how much money America can borrow. Because the U.S. spends more than it takes in, it borrows to make up the difference. The debt ceiling caps how much. The problem is, it's not enough. So, every once in a while, Congress needs to raise it. If it doesn't, the Treasury Department won't be able to pay all the country's bills in full and on time. Now the Treasury does have a little wiggle room before it gets to that point, what it calls extraordinary measures to move money around. But eventually, the accounting tricks run out and there's no more avoiding the debt ceiling. That's when the fireworks usually break out. REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY):  Our debt is out of control. I mean, we're talking about over $30 trillion. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA):  Me? I get rid of the debt ceiling altogether. It serves no function except to create leverage. REP. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX):  Look, they're difficult political times. Nobody likes them but they are necessary evils in a sense because it's the only time that you can actually negotiate ways to get our budget under control. ROMANS:  Now, many say raising the debt ceiling is just a license to spend more money and grow the debt but it's not really raising the debt ceiling just lets treasury pay the bills America already owes. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  There's nothing to do with any new spending. ROMANS:  If Congress really wants to clamp down on debt, it has to do it a lot earlier like before passing spending bills or tax cuts, both of which can add to deficits. Failing to raise the debt ceiling won't keep a lid on debt. It just risks the U.S. defaulting on its obligations something that could forever stain America's global reputation. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In 2005, the British travel company used an unscientific formula to determine what kind of day of the year? Best for shopping, the most depressing, the shortest, or the worst for traffic? Blue Monday as they called it was supposed to indicate the most depressing day of the year and it typically fell on the third Monday in January. Well, yesterday was the third Monday in January and while Blue Monday is a myth, some still use the marker to predict when travel purchases may peak as people are looking to escape the cold temperatures for a sunny vacation destination. The winter blues though, those can be very real. Ever hear of seasonal affective disorder? Our Dr. Sanjay Gupta tells us all about it and gives us some tips on how to make the most of the winter months and to help us find our happy place amid the wintertime grind. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Even if you love the cold and winter sports, you've got to admit, this has felt like a long winter. At least 12 million Americans suffer from something known as seasonal affective disorder or SAD, numbers probably even higher than that. Longer nights, shorter days, all of that leads to a chemical imbalance in the brain. What happens is your serotonin levels are down and melatonin, which makes you sleepy, that's up. To make sense, symptoms can be mild or severe, you can get fatigue, lack of energy over sleeping, difficulty concentrating, and also cravings for food that cause weight gain. That probably sounds familiar as well. Diet and exercise can always help. Also, get outside as much as you can. You can also get a specialty designed light box. You just sit there and stare at it for a while each day or at least put it on your desk, the point is you can get a boost of more natural light. Another tidbit, find things that bring you joy -- open up the blinds in your house, play some of your favorite music, and be with your family. Laughter and togetherness are always great therapy for the winter blues. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, is sinking into the ocean. So, the government of Indonesia has decided to build a completely new capital city in a completely different location. But at what cost? Aside from the estimated billion-dollar price tag for the futuristic smart city that the government officials are calling the world's most sustainable, critics say that the impact on the wildlife, ecosystem and indigenous people could be devastating. More now from CNN international correspondent Kristie Lou Stout. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LOU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Jakarta is a sinking city, scientists say the sprawling capital of Indonesia, home to more than 10 million people is dropping below sea level at alarming rates, mainly due to excessive groundwater extraction. The government of Indonesia has a plan, to carve a new capital city called Nusantara, out of the dense jungles of eastern Borneo. At an estimated cost of more than $30 billion, it's being designed as a futuristic smart city and touted by government officials as the world's most sustainable. JOKO WIDODO, INDONESIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  The development of the new capital has to become a move towards building cities that are healthy, efficient and productive, that are designed to be a place where the people are close from any destination, where they can bike and walk everywhere because there are zero emissions. STOUT:  Officials describe the new capital as a sort of Garden of Eden, built along the contours of the natural landscape. Nusantara is expected to be completed in 2045, and the government says it will be more than three and a half times the size of Singapore and home to nearly 2 million people. Officials and developers claim it will have minimal impact on surrounding rainforests that are some of the oldest in the world. SOFIAN SIBARANI, ARCHITECT:  We have in our -- in our guidelines is all the building, especially key buildings or government building needs to be green, green building. It needs to be sensitive to the environment. It's also futuristic. It's a future -- smart city, smart government, smart society, smart infrastructure. STOUT:  But some environmentalists disagree, warning of a potential habitat destruction. AGUS BEI, MANGROVE ACTIVIST (through translator):  The area is unique with its natural habitats and native species, and if its mangrove forests are destroyed, all the native species will be gone, too, and the next generations can only hear the stories about the species because they don't exist anymore. STOUT:  There is another concern about the project: the potential displacement of indigenous tribes. SIBUKDIN, BALIK TRIBE LEADER (through translator):  The land and the farms are inherited from our ancestors. The land is the biggest asset of our tribe. For us, the farm is the source of life. If our land is taken away, how could we farm? How could we live? STOUT:  To that, the government has said it will compensate landowners, and there are also some critics who say Indonesia should concentrate on fixing the problems in Jakarta arguing millions of residents will remain in the current capital struggling to cope with pollution traffic and worsening floods. DORINA POJANI, UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND:  Will it relieve congestion in Jakarta? Will it make whoever is left behind in Jakarta get to live a bit better? Well, I don't think so. STOUT:  As construction ramps up this year, many questions remain. But one thing is clear the road to creating Nusantara, Indonesia's shining city on a hill, will likely be an uphill climb. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. Today's 10 out of 10 is pandastic. Some baby pandas were having a tough time getting their bearings out of giant panda research and breeding habitat in southwest China. These cute cubs were tumbling, stumbling and rumbling. For all you teachers out there with toddlers or any of you with baby brothers or sisters, you know exactly the type of stress these researchers were feeling. My goodness. Pandemonium. All right. Now, shout out time. This one goes out to Washington middle school in Miles City, Montana. Rise up. I leave you with words of motivation today, one of my favorite Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. quotes in honor of yesterday's national holiday. If you can't fly, then run. If you can't run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward. Keep moving forward y'all. No matter what you're going through, you'll come out through on the other side a little bit stronger. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. END230118

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Today is January 18th, National Thesaurus Day, and we are happy, merry, mirthful, elated, ecstatic, enthusiastic, geeked up, on cloud nine, and tickled pink to be part of your day for the best 10 minutes in news. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. We have an awesome show for you today, so let's get going. We start by getting caught up on what's happening in the economy, specifically the job market. This past year, rising inflation and high interest rates made some economists fearful of a potential recession which among other things would make it difficult for people to find jobs. But in 2022, the labor market held steady with the economy adding more new jobs than many people expected. But what about 2023. Let's take 10 to break it down by the numbers. In November, there were 10.46 million available jobs in the United States, and while that was slightly fewer than the 10.51 million jobs available in October, there were still 1.7 job openings for each job seeker. Also, the Great Resignation is not over. Americans quit 4.2 million jobs and that figure was 2.6 million prior to the pandemic. We'll hear now from CNN business anchor and chief business correspondent Christine Romans who's with us to contextualize all the hows and whys of the current job market, especially in its uh recent headlines of all the layoffs that are happening across so many industries. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  It seems like every day brings another round of layoff announcements, especially in tech. Amazon, Meta, Twitter, Salesforce, Lyft, all among the companies cutting jobs. Media companies are laying off workers, too. Even consumer giants like Walmart and Pepsi are reportedly trimming staff. At the same time, the overall job market though is in desperate need of workers. There are more than 10 million job openings in the United States, about 3 million more than before the pandemic. Weekly unemployment claims are low and hiring remains robust. So, what's really going on in the job market? High profile headlines about tech layoffs don't tell the whole story. The industry hired aggressively during the pandemic and now, it's scaling back. NELA RICHARDSON, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ADP RESEARCH INSTITUTE:  It's important to note that tech is a very small percentage, 2 percent, of the overall labor market. So, tech is not a bellwether for the real economy or for the labor market. ROMANS:  Other sectors like leisure and hospitality and healthcare are much bigger, and they're still adding jobs. Those companies want to hang on to their workers, not fire them. The question now is whether the job market can stay strong. The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates to slow the economy, as it tries to fight inflation, and the Fed chief himself admits that's going to cost jobs. JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  There will be some softening in labor market conditions, and I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability. There isn't, and this is the best we can do. ROMANS:  For Powell, slaying the inflation dragon is the priority even if it means losing jobs. The Fed predicts the unemployment rate will rise to 4.6 percent by the end of the year. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, heroes don't always wear capes. We're getting a rare behind-the-scenes look into health and safety measures that recently saved an NFL player's life. Damar Hamlin of the Buffalo Bills suffered cardiac arrest in the middle of a game two weeks ago. And within seconds, medical professionals, heroes were at his side. Our Dr. Sanjay Gupta takes us to meet the NFL's chief medical officer for a detailed look at all the precautions taken, all the product protocols that are in place to protect players in America's most popular sport. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Dr. Allen Sills is the chief medical officer of the NFL. He's giving me a sideline view of the preparedness that goes into every game day. And once you see this, you'll probably never watch a game the same way again. You may have missed this pop-up blue tent. It's on every sideline. DR. ALLEN SILLS, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, NFL:  It's like a medical exam room. We've kind of made this a medical space, even in the middle of a very busy stadium. It's just so much easier to do things in here because like I said, everybody is just more relaxed. You don't have the cameras. You don't have the fans. GUPTA:  Or this, the injury review screen. SILLS:  So, we can be down here on the sideline and the spotter's booth, if they've seen an injury video, they'll queue it up for us, put on the video exactly what we need to see. We can talk to them. GUPTA:  The spotter's booth, they are the eyes in the sky. Hey. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Welcome, welcome. GUPTA:  Thank you. SILLS:  This is another part of our game day medical preparations. The real goal of this booth is to help spot any injuries or illnesses on the field. It can be hard to see the whole field from down there. GUPTA:  Right. SILLS:  Probably, to me, one of the most unique things in sports is the spotter can directly communicate down to the referee. These people can stop the game. SUE STANLEY-GREEN, CERTIFIED ATHLETIC TRAINER SPOTTER:  So, we watch every -- every play, probably minimally four times, and then we'll go back and watch it again. And so, you know, we just want to make sure we don't miss anything. SILLS:  It's always about the right people, the right plan and the right equipment. We have almost 30 medical professionals and everyone has a job to do. GUPTA:  ER doctors, orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, paramedics, X-ray techs and air-way specialists, like Dr. Justin Deaton. DR. JUSTIN DEATON, NFL AIRWAY MANAGEMENT PHYSICIAN:  So, this is the bag that I carry, and it's got a number of things that we could use. The first thing is a portable video laryngoscope. We have a portable ultrasound machine that we can use, and we also have the ability to perform surgical airways. I really have all the resources available here that I would have in an emergency room. GUPTA:  What's the biggest challenge of that scenario versus being in an emergency room? DEATON:  Well, the biggest challenge is the external environment and the chaos of the situation. When you have a larger than average size person that's lying flat on the ground and not able to be elevated to a certain level with extra equipment, plus cameras and other people around, those are really the things that make -- make it more difficult to manage. GUPTA:  How does everyone know you're the guy in charge? DEATON:  I wear a red hat on the sideline. But that signifies me as the emergency physician, the airway physician, so even the other team knows when I come out what my role is. DR. KEVIN KAPLAN, HEAD TEAM PHYSICIAN, JAGUARS:  If a player needs to get taken off of the field, the ambulance is going to be in the tunnel to your right. If you need anything at all, we'll be out there for you guys if you need us. Otherwise, I hope we have a safe and healthy game. Good luck. GUPTA:  Keep in mind, the medical team was able to get to Damar Hamlin within ten seconds. And speed really matters here. Every additional minute that someone in cardiac arrest goes without CPR, mortality goes up by up to 10 percent. SILLS:  This is a process that's in place for every single game and we train in the offseason, and just like the players train and practice, we do as well. So, I have tremendous confidence, but you always want to see a game with no injuries, and you want everyone to, frankly, be bored on the medical side. That's a good game from my standpoint. GUPTA:  I hear you. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Yakutsk, widely considered the coldest city on the planet, is located in what country? Canada, Russia, Norway or Mongolia? Located in the Russian province of Siberia, temperatures in Yakutsk have reached minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit this week. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANASTASIA GRUZDEVA, LOCAL RESIDENT (translated):  I have two mittens, two scarves. Warm shoes is a must. And you need to cover your head. SUBTITLE:  The temperature in Yakutsk, Siberia has dropped to -50 degrees Celsius. Residents of the city, known as one of the coldest on Earth, shared how they're managing the frost. GRUZDEVA:  Also, warm trousers, because the biggest heat loss is in the leg area. If your legs are cold, you are cold. REPORTER (translated):  Apart from dressing up warm, any other life hacks? NURGUSUN STAROSTINA, FISH SELLER (translated):  No, just dress warmly, in layers. Like a cabbage. ALYONA ZAITSEVA, FISH SELLER (translated):  We are freezing. But thanks to the customers we are on the move, so we warm up this way. TRANSLATED:  The mining city in Russia's Far East is experiencing an abnormally long cold snap but temperatures regularly drop below minus 40. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10 story, we're taking a trip to Wisconsin's highway 35 to meet Jeffrey the giant snowman. And Jeffrey's snow joke. He's 58 feet tall. That's more than four stories high. Drivers there are trying to keep their cool but Jeffrey freezes traffic to a halt with tons of people coming from hours away to get a glimpse and to take selfies with them -- an incredible feat by Craig Carlson and his two sons Beau and Hunter. They named Jeffrey the snowman after a loved one that passed away. Now that just melts my heart. All right. You already know what time it is. West Milwaukee Intermediate School in Milwaukee Wisconsin, we see you. Thanks for subscribing and commenting on our CNN YouTube channel. Before we go, it's #YourWordWednesday. So put your challenge word in the comment section of my most recent post @CoyWire on Insta, Snapchat and TikTok, and we're going to choose one fun word to work into tomorrow's show. I'm Coy Wire.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Welcome to CNN 10 and happy Friday Eve. It's your boy Coy. And the challenge words from your #YourWordWednesday were awesome, and this week ends with an OUS. It means beautiful. So, see if you can catch it. All right. We got a rendezvous with the news starting now and we begin in China, the most populated country on the planet. But for the first time in years, it recorded a population decline the last time deaths outnumbered births in China was during a great famine in 1961. A huge population has enabled China to produce a huge cost competitive workforce catapulting their economy's growth and this current population decline though is happening at the same time China saw its worst annual economic performance in half a century, and it's despite the government encouraging people to have more children. So, what could this mean for the global superpower? Well, China's elderly population currently makes up a fifth of its 1.4 billion people, with the number expanding to 280 million. And over the next several decades the number of people aged 65 and above is projected to surpass China's working age population and that would mean further impending troubles potentially for China's economy and their ability to grow. More now from CNN international correspondent Marc Stewart on what else this could mean for China and the global economy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The headline is significant. China's population shrank last year, the first time this has happened in more than 60 years, a decline of about 850,000 people. Let's break this down and look at some of the reasons why. First, priorities are changing. We're getting married later and some young people are not having children at all. In addition, Beijing held a controversial one-child policy until 2015, but it was relaxed because of concerns about the population. In 2021, three children were then allowed, and a plan was released to strengthen maternity leave and to offer tax deductions. In addition to all of this, the cost of living in China is high, so is education. And then there's just general economic uncertainty, that can all impact decision making. So, what are the takeaways from this? The United Nations is predicting India will surpass China to become the most populated country this year. And then there are the economic implications. This means an aging workforce without a pipeline into the future that could impact productivity and in turn economic success. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has raised these demographic challenges saying boosting birth rates and addressing the cost of raising a child will be part of future policy. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these words comes from a Latin term meaning bird? Auto, aerial, avian, or able? Avian is your answer here. It can be traced all the way back to a Latin word avis meaning bird. Did you know there's currently an egg shortage and now the prices of eggs are no yolk? One of the culprits is an outbreak of the avian flu, a virus mostly affecting birds. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the average price for a dozen eggs in California is more than seven bucks. It was just $2.35 a year ago. And one of my CNN teammates Maya in New York City, she spent $12 on a dozen eggs yesterday. That's a dollar per egg y'all. At these prices, I'm not sure those omelettes are all they're cracked up to be. Here's CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich who tells us exactly what's causing the shortage and these super high prices. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In chilly Palmer, Alaska, the demand for chickens and their eggs is heating up. DOON DYER, OWNER, POLARIS FARM:  I was already sold out even before the egg shortage. I was - I was selling everything I had. YURKEVICH:  If you've been to the grocery store recently, you may have noticed fewer eggs and higher prices, up about 11 percent last month on average from November, up nearly 60 percent in the last year. $11.49 for a dozen eggs in New York, $10.99 in Hawaii. SHANTEL ROLDAN, MANOA, HI RESIDENT:  I think it's ridiculous for it to be that much. YURKEVICH:  The highly pathogenic avian influenza, or avian flu, is largely to blame. Nearly 58 million birds and climbing have died across 47 states in the last year, a result of the deadly virus. Wild birds can carry the disease and spread it to domestic flocks when they migrate. CHELSEA CARRIGAN, OWNER, RED BARN FARM:  One wild bird coming into their chicken run and the next thing you know, 10 birds, 20 birds, 30 birds, they're just dropping dead. YURKEVICH:  Some states now recommending that all poultry be maintained indoors. Poultry and bird shows, canceled. And biosecurity around chickens, strictly enforced. SARAH SCHNEIDER, OWNER, EGG SHOP:  The avian flu is serious. YURKEVICH:  Egg Shop, with two cafes in New York City, is struggling with prices on their main ingredient. The fall migration of wild birds sent avian flu cases spiking again. SCHNEIDER:  We go through 7,000 to 9,000 eggs a week. So, it's a significant amount of eggs. And in the last couple weeks they've jumped as high as 60 percent. YURKEVICH:  How have you been able to absorb the high price increases of eggs? SCHNEIDER:  Unfortunately, we have raised all of our prices about 10 percent on our menu items. YURKEVICH:  For some, the increased cost is too much. Baked after Dark bakery in Nebraska will close its doors this weekend. STACEY JOHNSON, OWNER, BAKED AFTER DARK:  I think about what our family could afford to pay for a cookie. I take that into consideration. We can't charge $5 a cookie. YURKEVICH:  The ripple effect goes beyond restaurants and bakeries. Take a look around the grocery store. Items that use eggs, like mayonnaise, are up 11.8 percent in the last year. ANGELO PULEO, SUPERVISOR, MORTON WILLIAMS SUPERMARKETS:  From the flu to the increases in inflation, all combined together with the shortage, it is the perfect storm. VERA NEWHOUSE, NYC SHOPPER:  And I definitely have seen the prices shoot up recently. YURKEVICH:  Does that stop you from making the purchase? NEWHOUSE:  No, not at all. I'm just buying things to make a chicken cutlet. And you need eggs as the basis for that too. It's one of the reasons why there's no way not to purchase them. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, we're headed to Australia where every year in the Great Barrier Reef, corals spawn following a full moon. This is crucial because scientists said that rising temperatures have led to bleaching, and more than percent of the reefs surveyed last year. Coral that was once vibrant with pulchritudinous colors they're now colorless. Well, that does not mean though that the coral is dead just yet and a new technique just might bring the beauty back. Let's head down under the waves Down Under to learn more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUBTITLE:  For the past three years, researchers have used the annual spawning to test a restoration method called "coral seeding". CATHIE PAGE, AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF MARINE SCIENCE:  Coral spawning is the once in a year opportunity to replenish. So, it's a really valuable time for the reef but also a really important time for us to do our research. We allow coral lobby to settle onto 3D printed structures that we then deploy to the reef, and it's an opportunity for us to boost the number of very young corals on the reef and potentially boost rates of recovery on those reefs in the future. They have some protective features that might stop fish from biting them or algae from over growing them or sediment from settling on them. SUBTITLE:  So far, the technique has exceeded expectations. PAGE:  We're building year on year on our research in this area, trialing different designs one year and then building on those in the next. SUBTITLE:  The scientists seeded hundreds of corals during the reef's 2022 mass spawning. They hope their research will help restore reefs in Australia and eventually worldwide. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And today's story getting a 10 out of 10, a mirrored mirage and a camouflaged crib in Joshua Tree National Park. They call it the invisible house, 5,000 square feet of sleek design, mirrored on all sides blending into the topography like a chameleon, by reflecting the desert landscape and skies almost playing tricks on your eyes. But the inside, look at this, look at these views. From almost every single room in the house, absolutely stunning. And that's not all, there's a swimming pool inside that's 100 feet long. The invisible house has been a popular rental for lots of celebrities but now this southern California home can be all yours for a cool $18 million. Speaking of California, let's stay right there for our shout out today. Truckee High School in Truckee, California, we see you. And we hope you and everyone watching around the world can be a reflection of all that's beautiful or pulchritudinous in this world. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and I'll see you tomorrow. END230120

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. We made it. The weekend is upon us, and you already know Friday's rock. I'm Coy. This is CNN, and we are pumped to be right here to finish this week's strong with you. Let's start today by heading to Peru, the third largest country in south America after Brazil and Argentina is made up of a variety of landscapes from mountains to beaches. The multicultural nation considered the archaeological capital of South America has a population of million people. But recently, Peru is seeing some of its worst political violence in decades. It started last month with the removal of its former president and the protests have been so intense that people have lost their lives amid the violent clashes. The citizens aren't just protesting the most recent change in government. They're also upset about the political system that's governed the -- for the last 20 years. The people at the center of the protests are from the Andean regions, which are more rural and remote, away from big cities. Many experts say the protests illustrate deep divisions within this diverse country. More now from Stefano Pozzebon reporting on this story for CNN International. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN INTERNATIONAL:  Peru is seeing some of its worst violence in recent decades after the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo has led to protesters throughout the country to call for political change, particularly in the south where dozens of people have been killed in clashes with the police. But these protests are about so much more than former President Castillo. Peru has been experiencing a deep political crisis for years. The current president, Dina Boluarte, is the sixth head of state in less than five years and even if she were to go like some of the protesters are now demanding a solution to the crisis is hard to see. Both the presidency and Congress are widely discredited and are perceived as corrupted institutions. Only 21 percent of Peruvians said that they are satisfied with Democratic rule in the 2021 poll by LAPOP, a survey research laboratory at Vanderbilt University. And on one in two Peruvians, I think that the military takeover is justified when corruption is high. Even though the country has experienced an economic boom in recent years, the expectations of better living conditions have not been fulfilled. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Peru has recorded the highest per capita death toll in the world and according to the United Nations, over half of the population lack access to enough food. Many people simply think that the system is not working for them. Boluarte has so far resisted calls for early general elections and has declared a state of emergency in the areas of the country that have been most affected by the protest. The attorney general has opened an inquiry into Boluarte's handling of the unrest, and it's hard to predict how the situation will be in the near future. However, even if khan were to be restored in Peru, the root causes of this crisis still need to be addressed. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia of the three major mountain ranges in the United States, which is considered the oldest? Rocky Mountains, Appalachian Mountains or the Sierra Nevada? Appalachian Mountains is your answer here, home to America's longest hiking-only trail they're thought to have been formed around 480 million years ago. Let's go to the Appalachia Region now, home to more than 25 million Americans. The area extending from Mississippi to New York, known for its mountain terrain, relies heavily on the mining, forestry and agricultural industries. Recently though, a new industry has become a concern for some residents, the crypto mining industry, and mostly the noise pollution it creates. We'll hear now from CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir who recently traveled to Murphy, North Carolina, to speak with residents who pushed back when the sound of silence was replaced with the sound of cryptocurrency. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This is the sound of Green Mountain Farm. Certified by Quiet Parks International as one of the most peaceful spots in North Carolina. Thanks to their rare local enforcement of laws against noise pollution. Meanwhile, about 90 minutes away, beautiful Cherokee County sounds like this. It is stack upon stack of computer servers, and the fans needed to cool them. This is what's known as a crypto mine. And it makes the sound of people in San Francisco trying to make virtual money. WEIR:  How do you describe that noise? MIKE LUGIEWICZ, MURPHY RESIDENT:  We're probably sitting at probably 65 decibels right now. When it's at about 75, 80 decibels, I'd say a jet engine. A jet engine that never leaves. WEIR:  Sixteen months after the mine fired up without warning, Mike Lugiewicz put his house up for sale in frustration. TOM LASH (ph), MURPHY RESIDENT:  There would be turkeys out in the field and deer by the hundreds. WEIR:  Yes. LASH:  You don't have that anymore. WEIR:  While Tom Lash (ph) misses the wildlife -- PHYLLIS CANTRELL, MURPHY RESIDENT:  You don't sleep at night. WEIR:  -- Phyllis Cantrell says she feels trapped. CANTRELL:  You can actually lay your head on the pillow and hear it hum up through the walls. WEIR:  No way. Have you thought about moving? CANTRELL:  We're 73 years old. Where are we going to go? WEIR:  Imagine a game where the dice have a billion sides and the first person to roll a ten wins. That is essentially crypto mining. And to play that games these days, you need computers, thousands of computers running 24/7, 365. And after China outlawed crypto currency and crypto mining, more and more mines like this began popping up in Appalachia, places where the power is cheap, and the regulations are either nonexistent or unenforced. The mine has upended local politics. JUDY STINES, MURPHY RESIDENT:  I like to be behind the scenes, and I - I like to stir the pot. And I knew that we -- we needed to win an election. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Forget the noise -- WEIR:  Outrage over the mine helped flip the balance of power in November's county election. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Homegrown U.S. Senator Thom Tillis. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I do. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Congratulations. WEIR:  With the new board of commissioners now asking for federal help in ending American crypto mining. When asked over LinkedIn for reaction, Chandler Song, one of the mine's co- owners wrote, oh, boy, they wanted us so bad a year ago. As for the proposed ban, it is unconstitutional to say the least. Song and his crypto mining co-founder made Forbes 30 under 30 list a few years ago and recently claimed quarterly revenues of more than $20 million. But when asked follow-up questions, Song went silent. His mine in Murphy has not, so far. But the county attorney is looking for a legal way to shut it down. A cautionary reminder that the next time you hear a place as peaceful as Green Mountain Farm -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You're playing roulette with their lives. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's torture. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Come on. WEIR:  -- chances are someone got loud and fought for it. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEIR:  And for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, an artist that can recreate almost exact replicas of iconic marble sculptures. Here's the thing, the artist is a robot, Italian tech company Robotor created a 13- foot-tall stone chisel in Michelangelo Bernini wannabe that's recreating a famous 19th century Italian sculpture here. The 3D scans are used to analyze, assess and then carve away. The company says recreations are 99 percent faithful to the original. One thing's for sure though, they'll never completely be able to replicate the human touch. This brings to mind a thought I'd like to leave you with this week the type of person you'll become isn't determined by what you do, but how you do it. Carry love, peace and happiness with you into this weekend. And shout-out to Roland-Story Middle School in Roland, Iowa. Go Norseman! Remember, you are all more powerful than you know. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. It's been a blessing to spend this week with you. END230123

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello and happy Monday. I hope you had an awesome weekend and you're ready to start this week strong.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10 and I'm in Buffalo, New York, for yesterday's NFL playoff action. We start today, though, with news from the White House. On Friday, FBI investigators found more classified material while conducting a search of President Biden's Wilmington, Delaware home. This comes two weeks after it was first reported that classified documents were found at Biden's private office and then later again at his home in Delaware.  Also on Thursday, President Biden said there was nothing more to this a special counsel investigation has been appointed to look into the situation and here's why. According to the Presidential Records Act, presidential records belong to the government and must be given to the National Archives at the end of a president's term. The documents in this case date back to win then Vice President Biden worked for the Obama administration. After the discovery of the documents, the president's lawyers say they've given the documents to the government and are fully cooperating with the National Archives.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're fully cooperating looking forward to getting this resolved quickly. I think you're going to find there's nothing there. I have no regrets. I'm following what the lawyers have told me they want me to do. It's exactly what we're doing. There's no there there.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  This situation draws comparison to former President Donald Trump who is also under legal scrutiny for the scoring of classified documents at his home in Florida.  More now from CNN White House correspondent Jeremy Diamond. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Six more classified documents have been found at President Biden's Wilmington, Delaware residents. This time, they were found by FBI agents who were searching President Biden's home with the president's permission, the permission of his legal team. And with the supervision of a personal attorney to the president as well as a representative of the White House counsel's office. Now, all of this was revealed on Saturday night by Bob Bauer, the president's personal attorney who confirms that the FBI carried out a nearly 13-hour search of the president's Wilmington residence on Friday from 9:45 in the morning until around 10:30 at night. And those six documents being found of following an exhaustive search of the president's residence, the entire residence, we're told, they were given access to. Instead, this was done with the permission and the cooperation of President Biden's legal team.  But nonetheless, this is the fifth time in the last two weeks that we have learned of classified documents being found initially, it was, of course, at the president's former office in Washington for the Penn Biden Center. And then, of course, there was the discovery of documents at the President's Wilmington residence, and additional documents have since been discovered at that home or revealed since then. And that drip, drip, drip has certainly been problematic for a White House that has been insisting as the president did just days before this revelation, that there is no there there, insisting that he was surprised by the revelation of these documents and certainly a president who's trying to get past all this who hopes that the special counsel can do its work quietly, and ultimately exonerate him. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia:  Which of these terms refers to a group of chickens? Brood, pod, caravan, or troop? Brood is your answer here, though flock and peep are also terms used to describe a group of chickens. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  As we mentioned last week, an outbreak of the avian flu a virus affecting mostly birds is causing an egg shortage and it's a big reason why egg prices have surged. Well, I'm going to let you know about one solution some folks have found, more and more people are getting their yolks in their own backyard.  Having your own flock of chickens may be an excellent way to save some money, but some people are questioning the safety aspect and are being critical of the noise it can make for their neighbors. CNN correspondent Gabe Cohen has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GABE COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Every morning, Cassidy O'Donnell fetches a feast from her Pennsylvania yard. Fresh eggs from eight chickens, an idea she hatched last spring, as food prices surged.  CASSIDY O'DONNELL, CHICKEN OWNER:  We've seen that the price of eggs have gone up quite a bit. Now they've gotten even more expensive. So, grateful for the decision that we made a year ago.  COHEN:  The price of eggs is up a rotten 60 percent in a year, largely driven by a deadly avian flu outbreak across 47 states that's left some store shelves empty, inspiring more Americans to invest in backyard chickens, hoping to save some scratch.  MIKE HIGMAN, OWNER, MY PET CHICKEN:  What we're seeing right now is a wake up call from a lot of our customers.  COHEN:  Mike Higman owns My Pet Chicken, which sells chicken supplies for backyard flocks. He says business is booming, up 80 percent this month, compared to a year ago.  MIKE HIGMAN, OWNER, MY PET CHICKEN:  We're looking at record numbers, people are saying that prices of eggs are going up in stores, and that they're out of stock. This people that are concerned with what things are going to look like for food prices and food availability over the next 12 months.  COHEN:  Rene Ruiz built this coop last May, and purchased three chickens, with eight more just hatched, concerned with the cost of feeding his family of five.  RENE RUIZ, CHICKEN OWNER:  I just don't think it's sustainable for people to continue to just pay what they're being asked to pay in the supermarket, without having an alternative, and that's what this is.  COHEN:  But his hens haven't laid their first eggs. And he's already spent more than $1,000 on this project.  Do you think this will be worth it in the long run, as opposed to just buying eggs?  RUIZ:  Yes. It's going to pay off, not only after my first year. But just long term if I continue this process.  COHEN:  But some experts are skeptical.  Do you think most families won't actually end up saving money?  DR. BRIGID MCCREA, PH.D., POULTRY SPECIALIST:  No, the numbers don't really work out.  COHEN:  Bridget McCrea is a poultry specialist that teaches chicken owners how to raise small flocks, and she's warning them not to wing it, as costs like feed, housing, equipment, electricity, and time she says can drive up the average cost of backyard eggs to more than $20 a dozen.  MCCREA:  The reality is, that you're going to spend more money on your chickens at home than you are on eggs at the grocery store.  COHEN:  But Cassidy O'Donnell says her hens are already fluffing the family's bottom line, laying roughly eight dozen eggs each month, which could cost more than $40 in a store. Instead, she's spending about 20 bucks on chicken feed.  O'DONNELL:  So, we're saving a lot having them in the backyard right now.  COHEN:  And she expects roughly 150 eggs a month once the weather warms up, and says they'll try to sell what they can't eat.  O'DONNELL:  That's like $70 an egg at the store right now. So, yeah, we'll see a return on it.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And today's story getting a 10 out of 10 a bus for dogs. A wife/husband duo from Alaska have a dog walking business and they decided to drive around town to pick up the pups in style. CNN's Jeanne Moos takes us for a ride. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good morning Bama. JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It definitely isn't a Greyhound bus but there are hounds in it. MO THOMPSON, CO-OWNER, MO MOUNTAIN MUTTS:  Good morning, Jake. MOOS:  Nothing but dogs jumping into their assigned seats attached to leashes rather than seat belts, picking up waiting passengers with wagging tails. THOMPSON:  Good morning, Amaru (ph). Would you like a complimentary liver with your bus ride? MOOS:  Nobody said no. THOMPSON:  Jake. Dasher. Gumbo. MOOS:  This bus is better than an airline. THOMPSON:  Excuse you. You already had yours. MOOS:  The doggy boss -- THOMPSON:  Load up. MOOS:  -- is operated by Mo Mountain Mutts in tiny Skagway, Alaska. It's a husband and wife team offering dog training and dog walking. Do the dogs know their own seat? THOMPSON:  Most of them do. The new puppies don't. They'll try to just jump in any seat available. MOOS:  As they ride to outings -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, these are tangled. MOOS:  -- the bus offers the potential for entanglements. But when we watch them disembark -- oh sure, some of the passengers are rule breakers. THOMPSON:  Excuse me, ma'am, your tail is in the aisle. Ma'am, you're going to have to adjust your butt. MOOS:  But there's one seat that's off limits. THOMPSON:  Who's honking the horn? Bama? MOOS:  Bama's ready to trade her dog license for a driver's license. THOMPSON:  Excuse me, ma'am, you're not driving. Get out of my seat. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. We have two special shout-outs today.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, and you are awesome. We have a great show for you today, so let's get to it. We're going to begin with the news on lunar New Year. This is the year of the rabbit in Chinese culture. In China, the festivities are known as spring festival or lunar New Year because the New Year is determined by the lunar calendar. Every year, red packets of money will change hands and dragon dances will roar through the streets as people around the world usher in the New Year. The event typically results in what is considered the largest annual human migration as millions of people working and studying away from hometowns head back to reunite with family and celebrate. Lunar New Year lasts 15 days. It's an action-packed holiday with parades and fireworks and wearing red is crucial. The color red in Chinese culture is associated with luck and prosperity and, of course, we can't forget about the food. Grubbing is loving. And food is central and essential to all Chinese festivals and -- but sugary snacks man they are especially important for lunar New Year because they are said to sweeten up prospects for the New Year ahead. We'll go now to international correspondent for CNN, Marc Stewart, who has more on what lunar New Year will look like this year in China. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The lunar New Year is underway and despite a mask mandate here in Hong Kong, people are celebrating. Take a look at the iconic Victoria Harbor. People are lined up anxious to take a picture in front of the different plastic figurines. This is the year of the rabbit. There are families here. There are tourists here, all anxious to take pictures and in many cases just a few selfies. This is a big shift from last year at this time when much of Asia had a lot of restrictions, even lockdowns. In mainland China, things have opened up and as such, we have seen busy airports, busy train stations. During this roughly month-long period, it's estimated there may be as many as 2 billion individual trips out of this broader population of 1.4 billion people. While some health officials are expressing concern, the Chinese government feels that COVID has peaked in many places. As far as the year of the rabbit, it's a symbol of peace and prosperity, a wish that many people here in Hong Kong hope to share with the rest of the world. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these world heritage sites was built most recently? Machu Picchu, Great Wall of China, Chichen Itza, or Notre Dame Cathedral? Dating back to the 15th century, Machu Picchu is the youngest of these oldies but goodies. Right now, the world heritage site Machu Picchu is closed. It's among the greatest artistic and architectural sites in the world built as a legacy of the Inca civilization in Peru in the 15th century and then later abandoned. Built 2,400 meters above the sea level, the landmark site is made of approximately structures. And did you know what exactly it was used for is still a mystery to this day. This week, the government shut down Machu Picchu indefinitely as anti- government protests across the country grow. We'll hear more now from Rafael Romo, senior Latin American affairs editor of CNN worldwide, who has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR:  Peru's biggest tourist attraction, Machu Picchu, one of the seven wonders of the world Peru announced Saturday it's closing the famed site indefinitely including the Inca trail that leads up to it. Anti-government protests have choked transportation to and from the ancient citadel rail operators say they've had to suspend services because several tracks have been blocked or damaged by protests that have spread throughout the country. In the past month, dozens of people have been killed in violent clashes. The fiery protest erupting after the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo in December. Demonstrators are demanding new elections and calling for the resignation of current Peruvian President Dina Boluarte. The civil unrest has stranded tourists before. Last month, authorities evacuated hundreds of people after similar transit issues at Machu Picchu. Officials say this time around, some tourists have left by foot, but the trick is at least six to seven hours long. Machu Picchu usually draws more than a million tourists a year but it's now off limits. Peru's national treasure overshadowed by its spiraling political crisis. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, a Las Vegas family style Italian restaurant was struggling but now it has lines out the door. The owner of Frankensons Pizzeria says his dream of owning a restaurant was fading away until a local content creator Keith Lee made the restaurant an overnight sensation with one heartfelt TikTok review. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KEITH LEE, CONTENT CREATOR:  Yesterday afternoon, I got an email from an employee of a family-owned restaurant here in Vegas. I got it. Let's try it and rate it 1 to 10. SUBTITLE:  Content creator Keith Lee gave a heartfelt review after hearing from a manager at family owned Frankensons pizzeria. LEE:  Frank, if you're watching this, I'm going to be completely honest, you are an amazing man. SUBTITLE:  His viral TikTok gave the Las Vegas restaurant new life. LEE:  Let's try this food. Garlic knots off rick. These look amazing. Boy, that thing packed with flavor. I ain't going to try the ranch again because again I'm not a huge fan. This is one of the best wings I've ever had. SUBTITLE:  Lee has posted hundreds of taste testing videos, but his Frankensons review is by far the most popular, garnering 37.3 million views. FRANK STEELE, OWNER, FRANKENSONS:  So, I went out on delivery. It was just me and another girl walking that aisle because we're not busy. And the phone was just started blowing up. Come Tuesday morning, we had a long line out of our door prior to us opening up. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hey, guys how many saw this man on TikTok? (CHEERS) SUBTITLE:  Frank says prior to Keith Lee's visit, his restaurant was struggling with rent and on the brink of closing down. STEELE:  Thirty years ago, I had a dream of opening my own restaurant. Finally, this year, it came through with the help of my family. But I saw my dreams fading away because of the lack of traffic coming into my business. LEE:  That Summer, she the original employee that reached out to me. Summer, say hi. SUBTITLE:  Summer, the restaurant manager, reached out to Keith when she learned that the restaurant was close to shutting down. LEE:  The email read: I'm an employee at Frankensons pizzeria. It's really slow. We really can't afford rent and we would love for you to come and try the food. Frank, from me to you, this is my opinion. There is no way you should be behind our rent or struggling to pay rent. It is marketing. That's a hundred percent what I feel like. That food is delicious. The service is amazing. SUBTITLE:  Frank said he is overwhelmed by the onslaught of customers and hopes that the popularity will remain. STEELE:  People from everywhere and that is very emotional -- to me, but they will come out. It's support of my family and this trip is (INAUDIBLE). (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, if you love pizza, you're going to love this. Pizza Hut went to the Los Angeles Convention Center to build the world's biggest pizza. And to complete the task, workers put down layers of dough, tomato sauce, toppings then bake the enormous pie with a special heater. Let's break this pie down by the numbers. Nearly 14,000 square feet of pizza, more than thirteen thousand pounds of dough. We're talking nearly pounds of sauce and more than eight thousand pounds of cheese. At the end, it worked out to be 68,000 pieces of pizza for their record-breaking pie. And Guinness World Records confirms it's the world's biggest pizza. That is huge, for real though. Now, I'm going to be out the next two days but you're going to be in great hands, and I look forward to coming back to finish this week strong with you on Friday. I want to give a special shout out to Morton Middle School in Fall River, Massachusetts. We see you and we hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy.

JON SARLIN, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everybody. I'm Jon Sarlin. I'm a producer for CNN. I cover tech and business, and I'm the host of the CNN business show "Nightcap". I'm so excited to be with you today filling in for Coy Wire. Thanks for having me, Coy. We got a lot of news today, let's get started. We're going to begin with the latest news on Ticketmaster. Did any of you try to get tickets for the Taylor Swift concert recently? What about your favorite sports team? Well, if you did, chances are you probably saw tickets for those events on Ticketmaster. The company promotes itself as the way to buy and sell tickets online for concerts, for sports, for theater events. But Ticketmaster is in the news this week after the Senate judiciary committee held a hearing exploring whether the merger between Ticketmaster and the giant concert company Live Nation has led to a monopoly on tickets and harmed consumers by challenging any competition. In November, you might remember, Ticketmaster halted public ticket sales of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour after a chaotic rollout of pre-sale tickets left fans scrambling and waiting hours in virtual cues for tickets, congratulations to anyone who might have gotten them. But the debacle was so bad that it did something very rare, it united members of Congress from both the Democratic and Republican Party who fear that Ticketmaster now has a monopoly, meaning that they have exclusive control of the supply of tickets. We'll hear more on this now from CNN national correspondent Jason Carroll who has more on the details of the hearing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC) JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Scores of Taylor Swift fans still haven't shaken off the bitter feeling of being shut out of the pop star's upcoming tour this month. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Ticketmaster takes the $490 out of my account but it, like, crashed. CARROLL:  All that ire directed at Ticketmaster, which bungled the pop star's ticket sales so badly last November, it left thousands facing technical issues, such as canceled tickets, a crashing site and an artist beside herself over what fans endured to get tickets. Some of those who did get them ended up paying thousands for resale tickets just to get a seat to see Swift." Now Ticketmaster is in the hot seat. Its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment's president and CFO Joe Berchtold will have to answer to a Senate Judiciary Committee about claims the Swift fallout is the result of anticompetitive conduct from a company with too much influence. SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN):  I have called for years for a change and maybe Taylor Swift fans will probably put it -- will finally put it over the edge. CARROLL:  Berchtold is scheduled to testify Tuesday. Part of his planned testimony reads: In hindsight, there are several things we could've done better. We apologize to many disappointed fans, as well as to Ms. Swift. Antitrust experts say the real issue before Congress is whether Live Nation Entertainment is a monopoly, something critics say was created in 2010 when Ticketmaster and Live Nation merged. (MUSIC) CARROLL:  While some industry insiders questioned how much one hearing is likely to change things, others say the Swift movement has already had an impact. MORGAN HARPER, AMERICAN ECONOMIC LIBERTIES PROJECT:  This is going to be the first hearing that the Senate will be holding. And it shows that this is a priority issue for folks who are on the Judiciary Committee and that they see that there are problems with the Live Nation Ticketmaster merger. (END VIDEOTAPE) SARLIN:  Next up, 10-second trivia: What region is surrounded by the Adriatic Sea, the Ionian Sea and the Aegean Sea? Is it the Balkan Peninsula, the Amazon Basin, Patagonia or Western Plateau? Well, the only option here that's surrounded by all of these features is the Balkan Peninsula in Europe. Speaking of the Balkan Peninsula, let's travel to it to the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina where one lake is experiencing an example of extreme pollution, pollution so alarming that even environmentalists are surprised. And look, ocean pollution is not unique to the Balkans, but this collection point provides a clear picture of what can end up in waterways when not managed correctly. CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar has more on this story along the Drina River where a clogged lake filled with downed trees and frozen trash is gaining attention. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Snow falls on a lake on the Drina River. From up high, it's coated with frost, but get a little closer and you can see what's underneath the veneer of snow. A massive tangle of trash clogging the waterway. Even environmentalists are surprised by what ends up here. DEJAN FURTULA, ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST (through translator):  In addition to floating waste, such as plastic, there are also various household items, including refrigerators and stoves. There's nothing that is not present. But a significant portion is also fallen trees, which are very difficult to remove. CHINCHAR:  Experts say it's a recurring problem at this spot in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are several landfills and illegal dumps near the Drina River. And after a heavy rain, the waste washes into the water and collects here. Anti-pollution barriers have been installed where the waist ends up accumulating. Local authorities say the problem will continue until there's adequate waste collection, and people dispose of their trash more responsibility. FURTULA:  In addition to posing a significant health and environmental problem, this is a source of great embarrassment for all of us. As we seem unable to solve this issue for such a prolonged period. CHINCHAR:  A lake of trash, far from what nature intended it to be. (END VIDEOTAPE) SARLIN:  Next up, we're going to talk about the future of work and what exactly that looks like. So, while many companies offered remote work and flexible and hybrid schedules during the pandemic, workers may now be entering an era of having to go back into the office. Companies from Apple to Disney to Starbucks are now requiring employees work from the office for more than half of the workweek. Last week on nightcap, my show CNN's digital show focused on business and tech news, I spoke with a CEO Ed Zitron about what workers can expect in 2023. You can also sign up for the "Nightcap" newsletter and watch the show on CNN.com with new episodes every Thursday. Let's see what Ed has to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SARLIN:  The battle over working from home has entered a new phase. Disney just threw down the gauntlet requiring workers to be in the office four days a week, beginning March 1st. Two days later, Starbucks ordered corporate employees back to the office three days a week. Other companies are enforcing mandates as well. And Jane Frazier, the CEO of Citigroup, one of the only big banks to fully embrace hybrid work, just said this at the World Economic Forum. JANE FRASER, CEO, CITIGROUP:  We do want people collaborating in and they do collaborate better together. In productivity, you can see how productive someone is or isn't, and if they're not being productive, we bring them back to the office or back to the site and we give them the coaching they need until they get their productivity back up again. SARLIN:  So, with a tight job market, workers felt like they had the power to resist mandates to return to the office. But with all the big layoffs lately in tech media and other corporate jobs, has the power shifted back to the employers? And Zitron is the founder of EZPR who has written about working from home for "The Atlantic" and his newsletter "Where's Your Ed At". So, Ed, is it over? Have we reached the tipping point where this kind of workplace tug of war has now shifted back to the employer because workers are afraid of losing their job? ED ZITRON, CEO, EZPR:  I think that there is an implicit threat from companies around this, now that there is a rockier economy that there are layoffs happening, they're basically saying, we're not going to fire you but we need you back in the office due to reasons we will probably never explain to you. The thing -- the reality is, it's not going away. Remote work is not going away, but big companies, Starbucks, Disney and so on are using their leverage here of we're a big company and you want stability to say come back in the office because it makes us happy. (END VIDEO CLIP) SARLIN:  And for today's 10 out of 10 story, this fourth-grade paleontologist made the discovery of a lifetime. On Christmas morning, while walking on a beach in Maryland, Molly Sampson discovered a massive five-inch tooth from a prehistoric Megalodon shark, meaning big tooth. The Megalodon is an extinct species of mackerel shark that lived approximately a million years ago. Molly's mom said that children around the globe have sent letters to Molly sharing their excitement at her discovery. Good job, Molly. Last up, we can't forget to give a shout out. Today's special shout out goes to Mendota High School in Mendota, California. We see you. We thank you for watching. And for you and everybody else watching around the world, I hope you have a wonderful day. I'm Jon Sarlin and it's been awesome hanging with all of you this Wednesday. Have a great day. END230126

OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's going on from New York City, everyone. I'm Omar Jimenez and I am so happy to be back here with you for another exciting day of CNN 10.  Let's get right into it. If you search for this show on the world's most popular search engine or if you're watching on YouTube, then you've used a Google product to get here. This week, Google is in the news because the U.S. Justice Department and eight states have sued Google, accusing the company of harming their competition and the online advertising market.  For years, critics have said that Google has exploited their power and thwarted any competition. They say Google has used anti-competitive exclusionary and unlawful means to create a monopoly over digital advertising and that they've acquired their rivals through anti-competitive mergers. This move is the Biden administration's first big anti-trust case against the big tech company.  The eight states span both U.S. coasts that include California, Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Virginia. And while lawmakers and regulators have express concerns about Google in the past they've failed to pass new legislation or regulations. The last antitrust complaint against Google was issued by the Trump administration in 2020. So let's hear now from CNN's Anna Stewart based in the London bureau who has more on what we can expect from Google. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Allegations that Google holds too much control are nothing new, but this latest legal broadside from the U.S. Justice Department its first major anti-trust case under the Biden administration has certainly ramped up the pressure.  Now this complaint argues that Google has actively and illegally dominated the digital advertising market for many years as detailed by the U.S. attorney general in a press conference Tuesday. MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  For 15 years, Google has pursued a course of anti-competitive conduct that has allowed it to halt the rise of rival technologies, manipulate auction mechanics to insulate itself from competition and force advertisers and publishers to use its tools.  STEWART:  Now the lawsuit accuses the tech giant of controlling too much of the ecosystem of digital advertising including three main areas. Firstly, the technology used by major website publishers to offer ad space. Secondly, the tools used by advertisers to buy that space. And thirdly, the largest automated ad exchange essentially linking the publisher with the advertiser.  The U.S. government is calling for Google to be broken up and forced to spin off at least its online advertising exchange an ad server for publishers. Google responded with a statement saying: Today's lawsuit from the DOJ attempts to pick winners and losers in the highly competitive advertising tech sector.  It goes on to say their flawed argument with slow innovation raise advertising fees and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow. Google is not new to fighting antitrust legal battles. The DOJ sued Google for its dominance in web searches in 2020. The E.U. commission launched an antitrust probe into its conduct in digital advertising last year and has already fined Google three times in antitrust cases totaling more than nine billion dollars so far. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ:  All right. Ten-second trivia. What is the currency of Russia called? The rupee, ruble, yen, or franc? It's the ruble, the basic monetary unit of the Russian Federation. We turn now to Russia's war in Ukraine. On February 24th of last year, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine and fighting there has continued in the now nearly year ever since.  On Wednesday, Ukraine received what's being called a major sign of support from the United States and Germany. The nations both announced that they're sending tanks to the front line in Ukraine. Germany plans to send 14 tanks. And the U.S. is planning to send its special Abrams tanks to Kyiv.  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called the decision a turning point in the war and President Biden in a speech said the tanks will enhance Ukraine's capacity to defend its territory and achieve its strategic objectives. The president also announced a group of 50 nations that are making other contributions in the form of military equipment and weapons. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  As you all know, I've been saying this for a long time. The expectation of the part of Russia is we're going to break up, we're not going to stay united. But we are fully, thoroughly, totally united. (END VIDEO CLIP) JIMENEZ:  And though there was no immediate reaction from Russian President Putin, a Russian ambassador called Germany's decision to send tanks in extremely dangerous decision that would take the conflict to a new level of confrontation.  We'll hear now from CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson who has more on what to expect from Russian president Vladimir Putin. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (translated):  Dear Russian citizens -- NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  Putin's biggest issue in 2023 will be feeding his war in Ukraine, both men and materiel. But a visit to an armaments producer in mid-January, he commended workers for upping output three shifts a day, 24/7. He told them they'd be exempt from call up for military service in Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands of military-aged men fled Russia last year fearing conscription.  More than 100,000 Russian servicemen already believe killed in Ukraine. It's the most unpopular feature of Putin's war so far. More recruitment may spur more resentment of him. But at the rate he burns through soldiers on the front lines means that this dilemma is only going to get worse foreign. His second biggest issue would be paying to feed the war. International economic sanctions are beginning to bite. If they chew into Russian citizens' pockets, then Putin has a problem.  The dangerous high-wire walk Putin is trying to pull off keep the value of the ruble up, keep people in jobs, it's only going to get harder. A cold winter next year, impoverished Russians on the streets risks a revolt against the war and Putin himself and this will play into Putin's long-  range concerns, an election 2024. In 2021, he signed a law allowing him to remain leader until 2036, but he has built a house of cards. Russian elections are neither free nor fair, Putin has snuffed out dissent, locked up opposition leaders, taking control of all media but even that requires mafia-style playing of Russia's power brokers against one another.  If he can't make gains in Ukraine or worse starts racking up losses, his grip on Russia's power game could weaken. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ:  For today's 10 out of 10 news, a story as old as time. The rivalry between cat and microwave? Yeah, well, we have an insane video to prove it.  So, I'm going to let CNN's Jeanne Moos explain it from here with the details of this epic story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  There was nothing micro about the epic battle waged by Bentley the cat against this microwave. He yanked it. He physically moved it. He would have certainly gotten into it if it weren't for the child lock his owners put on it to keep him out. BRITTANY SCHIESL, PET OWNER:  His body language while doing it, it doesn't seem like a cat. MOOS:  He's got this physique. He's got like a great body. Using his legs like arms, he might have pulled the microwave right off the counter if the cord weren't plugged in. No wonder this sometimes cross-eyed cat from Sheridan, Oregon, has gone viral with millions of views. Bentley has been obsessed with the microwave ever since Brittany Schiesl left pizza in it. SCHIESL:  The microwave is wide open and the pizza is on the floor and gone pretty much. MOOS:  They also had to put a lock on the kitchen cabinets where Bentley uses all four legs. Without the child lock, we clocked him getting into the microwave in eight seconds flat. Brittany says the appliance is his best friend. This story reminds me of one I did 27 years ago about Peggy the bull terrier who got into the fridge so often, his owner had to keep it locked. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And then I stick it through the hole. MOOS:  But when it's cat versus microwave, sometimes the cat moves the appliance, and sometimes the appliance moves him. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ:  And before I go, it's time. I want to give a huge shout out to Elmira High School in Elmira, Oregon. We hope you and everyone watching there and around the world have a wonderful day.  I'm Omar Jimenez. It was so great to join you all today. See you soon. END
