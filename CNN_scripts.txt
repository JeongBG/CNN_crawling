COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Bad news it's only Thursday. Good news it's Friday eve and we're going to slay today. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and we have a powerful show for you today. And we start with the ongoing and devastating situation occurring in Nigeria in West Africa. A month ago, the country experienced its worst flooding in a decade. Hundreds were killed as homes and businesses were submerged. Weeks later, the death toll has risen and communities remain underwater, displacing more than one million people from their homes.  Victims of the flood blame the tragedy on the government's response or lack thereof. Government officials say they released flood warnings ahead of the disaster and advised residents to move to safer ground. There is a question as to whether those warnings even reach some communities and experts say proper relief has not reached many Nigerians. Food is scarce in the country and difficult for many to afford. Nigeria's economy is struggling. Inflation hit a 17-year high of over 20 percent in August. This has further strained people's spending power and capacity to relocate. People have lost everything and many survivors are living in terrible conditions in camps and shelters with little to no government assistance. CNN correspondent Larry Madowo has been reporting on this for us on the ground in Bayelsa, Nigeria, where he's seen firsthand the tragic events that people there are facing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Our communities still submerged nearly a month after the flooding began with no end in sight. Boats have become the only way to get around much of Bayelsa State in Southern Nigeria. The streets have turned to rivers, driving entire communities away from their homes.  We have really suffered, she says. Tell the government to help us. UGERE OBI, FLOOD VICTIM:  Again, tell them to come help us. MADOWO:  Everything you own is here under the water and this is your house? OBI:  Yes. Everything. MADOWO:  Some are living rough on the streets, washing with this water, cooking with it and bathing in it. Even people's homes and businesses and livelihoods are already submerged, it's still raining and there is more expected. The Nigerian government is warning this could go until November, so even more of this. This is Nigeria's worst flooding in a decade.  Aniso Handy has remained in this house through it all. ANISO HANDY, FLOOD VICTIM:  Nigerians are used to manage. If not, we would have all died. We have not seen this situation where people are not cared for. But Nigerians care for themselves. We are just like infants that have no father, no mother. MADOWO:  The feeling of abandonment runs deep here. The victims are disappointed with the Nigerian government's response which hasn't declared the flood a national emergency. The floods have affected 33 of Nigeria's 36 states partly due to well above average rainfall.  Bayelsa is among those cut off from the nation with major highways underwater. The situation has been exacerbated by poor drainage infrastructure and an overflowing dam in neighboring Cameroon.  But with a warmer climate causing more intense rainfall, authorities have also blamed it on climate change, angering some Nigerians. In this community though, there are more short-term consequences. It's a tough life to navigate for humans and animals alike, but life must go on.  Larry Madowo, CNN, Bayelsa State, Nigeria. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up today, a debate around driverless cars. Are they safe? Are they needed? Are they helpful?  Well, what do you think?  The technology continues to be tested in various cities around the U.S. and one company called Waymo just announced it's planning to launch robo taxis in one of America's most populated cities, Los Angeles. They've already been tested in Phoenix, Arizona, and San Francisco.  We're talking fully autonomous or self-controlled driverless rides relying on detailed maps and sensors to navigate their surroundings. Proponents say these electric vehicles would provide more eco-friendly modes of transportation, while opponents of safety concerns and say that technology is not quite ready to be taken mainstream. CNN transportation editor Michael Ballaban gives us a glimpse now at a recent experience he had with the full self-driving technology available in a Tesla. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL BALLABAN, CNN TRANSPORTATION EDITOR:  Oh, we've got a situation in front of us. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, no, we're going on the wrong side of the road. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Nope, nope, nope. It wanted to hit the truck.  This is a Tesla model 3. So we are turning on the full self-driving beta. Okay, the car is now officially technically sort of driving itself. Whoa, whoa, that was a really sharp turn the car just tried to make. Oh, we've got a situation in front of us. Whoa. Okay, what we just had in front of us was a UPS truck coming onto our lane. We had a guy in front of us with a cargo bike. To avoid hitting the guy on the bike, the car seemed to want to put us straight into a giant UPS truck. I would prefer not to hit a UPS truck today. So I took over. It does seem to need an interruption every couple of blocks or so. Sometimes if the car is hesitating a little bit I have to intervene. You also have to be ready to take over at any time. Now, this is challenging. Oh, no, we're going on the wrong side of the road. We're not trying to make this car screw up. We're not trying to have a laugh at Elon Musk's suspense. That's not the point. We're really just trying to see how it handles driving in the city.  So far, it's going okay. We're going down a pretty just straight normal road. There's not a lot of pedestrians here and when you're going down a straight road with not a lot of pedestrians, the car actually seems to be doing okay. We're doing right around the speed limit. You know, we're not hitting anything.  The car can see cones. The car can see trucks. The car can see even pedestrians on the other side of the street.  Seeing might not be totally the issue here, it's knowing what to do in challenging situations, stuff that experience teaches you. A lot of people have issues with this being called full self-driving. First and foremost, it's not fully self-driving, I have to sit here. If it was fully self-  driving as promised that would let you take a nap, while you're driving along.  You know, it does seem to be making all the drivers upset. It's the people behind us it's the people honking. Now I'm not saying of truly fully autonomous car will never happen but I think at this point we're still years away. SUBTITLE:  Tesla did not respond to CNN Business' request for comment. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  I like to think of myself as a fun guy, but I've got nothing on these guys. Did you know that mushrooms are the largest life forms on the planet? Yep, they expand and grow underground with interconnected fibers called mycelium, looking for food, often nutrients from soil and trees, alive or dead. In fact, the largest living organism on Earth right now is a single honey mushroom in the Malheur National Forest in Oregon. It's three and a half miles wide about 2,500 acres, and it's believed to be about 2,400 years old. Now, that's a humongous fungus and that's random. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  All right. Halloween is exactly two peace signs days away, and I am loving your costume suggestions that you've been sending me on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok. Lex Luthor, Mr. Clean, keep them coming. I'm @CoyWire there. And speaking of TikTok, 73-year-old sensation Barbara "Babs" Costello has given folks pumpkin to talk about. Carving tips like sprinkling cinnamon in there to treat your olfactory senses. Oh my gord. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBARA COSTELLO, TIKTOK SENSATION:  I'm going to remove all those nasty strings the easier way. SUBTITLE:  This 73-year-old TikTok sensation gave us some hacks on how to improve the spooky season.  In a new video, Barbara "Babs" Costello broke down the do's and don'ts of pumpkin carving.  COSTELLO:  Hi, everybody. It's Babs. Did your mom ever tell you the do's and don'ts of pumpkin carving? SUBTITLE:  1. Carve the pumpkin from your lap. COSTELLO:  Don't stand and carve your pumpkin. Sit. Just put them on your lap. SUBTITLE:  2. Carve from the bottom of your pumpkin. COSTELLO:  Now time to cut the bottom of your pumpkin, not the top.  SUBTITLE:  3. Use a hand mixer to clean out your pumpkin. COSTELLO:  Don't do this. Use your hand mixer instead. Get all those strings cleaned up. Your mixer did the hard work of loosening all those strings. SUBTITLE:  4. Use a red dry erase marker to design the face. COSTELLO:  When designing your pumpkin face, use a dry erasable red marker that you can get rid of the lines after you carve.  SUBTITLE:  5. Carve the design with a rubber mallet and a cookie cutter. COSTELLO:  If you don't want to struggle using a knife to carve your pumpkin, just use a soft-headed mallet and your cookie cutter, and just push it right through. Remove all your red lines. SUBTITLE:  6. Cover all surfaces with Vaseline to keep it fresh. COSTELLO:  Don't let all your work go to waste. Those kids want to enjoy these pumpkins. Take Vaseline and rub it on all the open cut surfaces. We'll keep your pumpkin moist won't dry out as quickly, and it should last about one to two weeks.  SUBTITLE:  7. And finally, sprinkle some cinnamon. COSTELLO:  And if you want a beautifully scented jack-o-lantern, try sprinkling some cinnamon right on the top and over the candle she goes and she smells delicious. Happy Halloween. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. You gorgeous creatures, today is National Civics Day, celebrating the importance of civic education as a foundation for a strong democracy.  And we want to give a strong shout out now, Walnut Cove, North Carolina, Southeastern Stokes Middle School. Rise up and have an awesome day.  It's almost Friday. See you tomorrow.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. It's your boy Coy, and it's Thursday. So, happy Friday eve to you. This is CNN 10. We have an awesome show for you today, so without further ado, let's do what we do. We start today with the latest news out of China. Foxconn, one of Apple's largest suppliers, is racing to control a COVID-19 outbreak at its campus in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou. Trending social media videos show anxious workers reportedly fleeing the lockdown facility earlier this week after experiencing food shortages and difficult living conditions, including mandatory isolation. The city, which has a population of more than 12 million people, identified dozens of COVID-19 cases last month and the Chinese government shows few signs of easing its COVID policies. These events highlight how China's strict zero COVID policy is hurting international business. We'll hear now from my colleague Selina Wang, the CNN international correspondent, reporting on the chaotic conditions at the Foxconn factory. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Chaos at Foxconn, one of Apple's largest suppliers. It's Zhengzhou factory, which is its largest iPhone assembly factory in central China, is trying to contain a COVID flare-up but workers are fleeing the COVID restrictions. Viral videos on social media show masses of workers carrying their luggage trekking long distances across highways. Workers in recent days have been flooding social media with complaints about subpar living conditions, the poor quality of food and the difficulty and getting enough food amid the intense COVID restrictions. The exodus is putting major strain on Foxconn at a critical period just before the holiday season. It's another reminder of how China's zero COVID policy is hurting international businesses. According to analyst estimates, the Zhengzhou factory accounts for as much as 85 percent of Apple's iPhone assembly capacity. According to Counterpoint Research, they estimate that this could jeopardize 10 to 30 percent of the iPhone-14 production if this situation doesn't stabilize in the near term. Now, according to state media, Foxconn is trying to boost capacity production at other sites. The company says it is actually quadrupling bonuses for workers at the Zhengzhou plant in order to incentivize workers to stay. But zero COVID is clearly still having a massive impact on businesses, on people's daily lives, the entire city of Zhengzhou, which is home to more than 12 million people, it's been under lockdown since late October. These constant lockdowns in China are causing global businesses to re- evaluate the reliability of China as a production base. In fact, Apple has been increasing production in places like India in order to reduce its dependency on China. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In Spanish, the word "manta" means what? Blanket, bread, balloon or basket. Manta refers to a type of cloak or blanket which is why manta rays share the name describing the look of the animal's large flat diamond-shaped bodies. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Today is CNN's Call to Earth Day, which aims to highlight the conservation work of organizations and individuals around the world and in connection with that. We have a special feature with marine scientists and Rolex Awards laureate Kerstin Forsberg who's working to protect manta rays in her home country of Peru. I recently had a chance to talk with her about her experience beneath the waves. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KERSTIN FORSBERG, MARINE BIOLOGIST AND CONSERVATIONIST:  The ocean is our source of life. The ocean touches us in every single second. It's, you know, connected with our atmosphere. The ocean provides resources. The ocean provides oxygen in our planet. The ocean provides so many different things to inspire us even on a cultural or emotional level. WIRE:  What made you fall in love with the ocean? Why did you choose this path? FORSBERG:  I was passionate about nature and environment and animals ever since I was a kid. I was always reading about animals, reading about nature. And then I think as I grew up and I decided to start a career in biology, it became really clear to me that the ocean was in real trouble, and that a lot of people needed to really start to think about the importance that the ocean has on our everyday lives. WIRE:  You have designed and developed dozens of environmental initiatives. What are some of the biggest challenges facing our oceans and ocean life right now? FORSBERG:  We're taking all the resources out of it. We're polluting the ocean. We're putting all our waste and dumping all their waste into it. So it's really about thinking of us as our everyday and how we connect to the ocean, and how we can depend on the ocean, but we can also shape the ocean. So, through sustainable seafood consumption, through making sure that we are utilizing our waste properly, and that's how we're going to ultimately stop those challenges which at the end are all about over-exposition, pollution and also climate change and habitat destruction. We started building a network of schools. It's called the Marine Educators Network of Northern Peru. And this network of schools started to grow, in over local schools in northern Peru, connecting between each other with teachers starting to incorporate ocean literacy within classrooms, but then building on that having youth start developing their own environmental projects that benefited their communities. First of all, we work with schools. We partner together with schools and with teachers and we develop an ocean literacy training program in which kids learn about the ocean, learn about how we're connected to the ocean. But even beyond that, they learn about environmental leadership and how to develop their own project. So we're giving them the tools on how to develop a project how to set out goals how to develop your own budget, how to track your progress and in doing that connect kids so we've developing feedback between each other and really developing this sense of global citizenship at the end, right? We all need to start connecting between our ourselves as global citizens in order to move forward and address sustainability challenges. WIRE:  Well, we have a special day, Call to Earth Day. I'm sure you have something up your sleeve or two. FORSBERG:  For Call to Earth Day, we will be hosting an activity in northern Peru, with over 40 different youth. These are local university students and we're partnering with a series of local organizations, including from the regional government and civil society and conservation areas. So, it's really about having everybody together. It's going to be a huge celebration, where different organizations come together, with different youth come together, and again, we're different disciplines, right? Come together, and ultimately, land and sea come together So, that's what it's all about for us, Call to Earth. It's a celebration of our planet that connects us all. WIRE:  Kerstin Forsberg, your -- your smile, your passion are contagious. You inspire us as we aspire to make this world a bit of a better place. Thank you so much for joining us. FORSBREG:  Thank you so much for the invitation. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, we may have bitten off more than we can choo choo. The world's longest ever passenger train took a trip through the Swiss Alps. What ingenuity, this train is 1.2 miles long, made up of a hundred cars, it had to be a slowcomotive, taking about an hour to complete a 15-mile trip, through 22 tunnels, over 48 bridges. The record-breaking event took place on October 29th, the 175th anniversary of Switzerland's first railway. For your news, for some fun, we're here for you train or shine. And so is shout-out time. Mrs. Bush's class at Bosqueville Middle School in Waco, Texas. Think it, speak it, believe it. Did you know that today, November 3rd is National Stress Awareness Day. So, like my four-year-old daughter tells me, smell the flowers, cool the soup. Whenever you feel overwhelmed, don't fret about the future. Don't worry about the past. Just take a deep breath and embrace the power of now. I'm Coy and this is CNN 10. END221103

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey you. You made it to Friday, and you already know Friday's rock. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. And we've got an awesome show for you today. Let's finish this week strong. I have some good news to start your weekend. Many of you get an extra hour of sleep on Sunday, Daylight Saving Time. But could this be the last year of it? Every year on the first Sunday of November at 2:00 a.m., many of us turn our clocks back an hour. On the second Sunday in March, they spring back forward an hour. But where did this idea of shifting time come from and why is it so polarizing? Let's take 10 to break it all down. While Benjamin Franklin gets credit for the first mention of the idea, Daylight Saving Time was first implemented in the U.S. with the Standard Time Act of 1918. A wartime measure with the purpose of adding more daylight hours to conserve energy resources Currently, not all states participate in daylight saving, including most of Arizona and Hawaii. Over 70 countries around the world use daylight saving time with notable exceptions of China and Japan. But earlier this year, the U.S. Senate passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act which would make Daylight Saving Time permanent year round, beginning in the fall of 2023. That bill is currently sitting in the House of Representatives. If passed there and then signed by the president, it would mean no more changing clocks in the U.S. There are, of course, arguments for and against the practice. We'll travel to the United Kingdom now to meet a small group of clockmakers who have a big job of making sure everything is working on time, especially when it comes to the time change. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX JEFFREY, CLOCKMAKER, PALACE OF WESTMINSTER:  I love talking about clocks. I could talk about clocks all day. Not everyone wants to hear about them, but everyone wants to hear about the clocks at the Palace of Westminster. Whether it's Big Ben, whether it's just being interested in such a busy building, working on clocks, doing the time change, maintaining, it's something I take a lot of pride in. REPORTER:  Ian Westworth and Alex Jeffrey are part of a small team of clockmakers at the Palace of Westminster in London. Twice a year, when the clocks spring forward or fall back across the United Kingdom, they have the responsibility of adjusting 2,000 timepieces before lawmakers return to work. JEFFREY:  There's two thousand clocks on the parliamentary estate. There's 500 heritage clocks, there's two days and it's our task to perform the GMT time change. IAN WESTWORTH, CLOCMAKER, PALACE OF WESTMINISTER:  And overnight, we changed Big Ben. The great clock of Westminster and we put that back an hour just to make sure everybody who can now see the dials can actually tell at the right time when they wake up on Sunday morning. JEFFREY:  So, this is one of our heritage clocks. There's around four or five hundred of them, and they're just going to bring the minute hand back to do the time change being careful not to graze the dial, and it's -- in one of the committee rooms along committee corridor where a lot of important meetings happen. WESTWORTH:  We have clocks here that pre-date this palace and some that were designed specifically for this palace. We do actually come across clocks that we've never found before. It only happened the other week. An MP contacted us saying, I've got a clock in my office, it hasn't run for some time. And I'm thinking, I've been here 18 years and I've never been into your office. He said that's probably why it hasn't worked. JEFFREY:  The time changes were put in initially as a mechanism, a practical mechanism to take advantage of daylight hours in the summer. So, it's important I think to keep that tradition. REPORTER:  In the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill championed the concept of daylight saving during the First World War before he became prime minister, believing that the country could save energy by stretching the hours of evening sunlight. The practice has spread across the world. In the U.S. most states observe daylight saving moving clocks forward in the spring. Only Hawaii and most of Arizona don't. In 2022, the Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act, a law which would make Daylight Saving Time permanent across the United States from November 5th, 2023. If passed by the House, the clocks would not fall back again. In the U.K., a 2019 poll showed that a small majority of Britons want to keep changing the clocks. At the Palace of Westminster, its resident clockmakers are responsible for maintaining this tradition. WESTWORTH:  Even with this digital world, you know, everybody's got a computer with a clock at the bottom or they've got a digital watch on. But the MPS and the lords or the staff, who've actually got a ticking clock in their office. One of the first things they look at is the ticking clock and not the one on the wrist. Our job is to make sure that every day, these clocks are working for them. The last clock of the day before doing great clock tonight. JEFFREY:  You know, there's a lot of ground to cover. I left my step count on last year and it was 55,000 steps. It's very time consuming but it's very rewarding. You know, we can say to each other, well done, guys. It's a job well done and when people turn up for work on Monday, they're right on time. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And now it's time for some hero talk. We've been introducing you to CNN Heroes since the start of the school year. Together, we met a woman upcycling old computers to open new worlds for young people in our home country of Kenya. We met a teacher in New Jersey on a mission to hand out free books by the thousands. This week, CNN announced the top heroes of the year. Let's meet them and hear how they are making this world a better place. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  From California when elderly dog owners can no longer care for their pets, Carie Broecker helps them stay together or finds these beloved family members new forever homes. From Nashville, Richard Casper uses art to heal the wounds of war. He's helping fellow veterans share their stories visually and vocally. Nelly Cheboi is bringing technology to young people in her native Kenya, recycling old computers, she provides the tools and education for brighter futures. North Carolina innovator Nora El-Khouri Spencer is training women for well- paying careers in construction while also helping seniors age safely at home. From south Philadelphia after spending five years in prison on drug charges, Tyrique Glasgow is now providing his neighborhood long challenged by poverty and gun violence with safety and opportunity. Alaskan nurse Teresa Gray leads volunteer medics into global hot spots, delivering vital care and support to those in need. Meymuna Hussein-Cattan is helping refugees and immigrants transition to lives in the U.S. with critical resources and support while also sharing their culture with the L.A. community. Aidan Reilly brought together a nationwide network of young volunteers tackle food waste and insecurity they're rescuing tons of excess produce from farms to feed the hungry. From Chicago, Deborah Vines struggled to find support and resources when her son Jason was diagnosed with autism. Now, she's providing services and education to African American families and first responders. And Atlanta's Bobby Wilson is feeding and healing his urban community by teaching thousands of people how to plant grow and prepare their own healthy food. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: American, Bridal Veil, and Horseshoe are features that combine to make what natural wonder? Great Barrier Reef, Niagara Falls, Grand Canyon, or Galapagos Islands. Located on the U.S. Canadian border, these are the names of the three waterfalls that together make Niagara Falls. (END VIDEO CLIP) WEIR:  We're giving this next story an A-plus, a gold star, and a 10 out of 10. Niagara Falls, one of the natural wonders of the world, on the New York and Canadian border, draws visitors from every corner of the planet who come to see its majestic cascading water. Well, there's a tunnel buried deep beneath the falls. It's been off limits until now. It's about seven football fields long it was built more than a century ago on the Canadian side as part of the former Niagara Parks Power Station. And visitors can now venture through the plant down the corridor and onto a waterside platform for some of the most breathtaking views in the world. This has been an awesome week.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  It is Monday and it's going to be the best day because it's the next day. I'm Coy, here with your news, some inspiration and a little bit of fun. Thanks for choosing us to help you start your week strong. We begin today with news on the Mississippi River. This video shows the river at historically low levels from Illinois to Louisiana. Experts say the record low water levels are due to the worst drought in the central part of the United States in at least a decade and that we can expect to see continued decreasing levels in the months to come. Lack of rain or snow over a period of time and atmospheric conditions such as temperature change and changes in the jet stream are all factors that can contribute to drought and low water levels. According to the U.S. drought monitor, half of the United States is covered by moderate drought conditions or worse, with more than 134 million people affected. That's the highest part of the population since 2016. And the Midwest has seen the worst of it. Several inches of rain are possible over the next week near the Mississippi River which could provide some relief but the drought is forecast to continue through January and low water levels have some serious consequences. They could impact crops at a crucial time for harvest and allow for salt water from the Gulf of Mexico to travel up the Mississippi River which could potentially spoil Louisiana drinking water with salt.  And while the Army Corps of Engineers has been dredging or excavating portions of the river's basin to make a path for boat traffic to keep flowing. It's at such a slow pace, hundreds of barges and vessels carrying goods are waiting for the all-clear to be able to pass through the shallow river. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  To navigate this river in the old South, a man would stand on the prowess steam ship and bounce a lead weight on a knotted string off the bottom. If it was a safe 12 feet deep, he'd shout "Mark Twain". Samuel Clemens made that his pen name, of course.  But if he wrote about this river today, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn would spend a lot of time walking on the beach because in too many places, the not so mighty Mississippi is a fraction of a Twain. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're going to look at a few old steamboats, steamboat racks. WEIR:  Mark Twain era steamboats? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah. WEIR:  And the relentless drought across the heartland is exposing all kinds of memories. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It may have caught on fire or sank 50 miles upstream and floated here during floods. WEIR:  As far as water levels go, this is as worse if you've ever seen? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is about as low as I've seen it. WEIR:  From the Missouri down to New Orleans, accidental archaeologists are finding steamboat graveyards and human remains, Civil War ammo and forgotten shipwrecks. And one of the more striking yardsticks is here in Baton Rouge. This is the USS Kidd, a World War II destroyer, and on a good year the Mississippi comes to that first rush strike, about 25 feet above my head right now. And these water levels are so low creating such a catastrophic shipping crisis that this is going to affect your grocery bill, is the price of moving. A bushel of soybeans went up 300 percent and there are thousands of barges full of food and all they can do is just wait and pray for rain. And if they can't get rain, they pray for help. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We've got a difficult stretch of river. WEIR:  From the Army Corps of Engineers, with billions of dollars on the line, they cut channels as fast as they can with working antiques like the Dredge Potter. Built in 1932 but still a workhorse and an endless fight with the river in every kind of weather. You're a professional riverbed redecorator. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kind of, yeah, yeah.  WEIR:  A little of this over here. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's right. WEIR:  Over there. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As long as we can keep barges moving and keep commodities prices down, we're all in good shape. WEIR:  That's your -- that's your mission. It's impressive to see up front. Andy, you know the Ole Miss better than most, huh? You've been doing this a while. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thirty-four years. (LAUGHTER) WEIR:  And how would you characterize what's going on these days? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is a concern, a heightened concern. I don't know that I -- we call it a panic yet, but we are watching the water levels very closely, on an almost an hourly basis.  WEIR:  Is it the kind of thing where if this goes on you can dredge around the problem? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  To a point. In 1989 and then again in 2012, we got to an area where the chan -- to a level where the channel was almost unsustainable. So we had numerous dredges working and there was very little commerce going through. And ultimately, what saved the day was rain. WEIR:  And these days, when you wish for rain, you have to specify not all at once. The Midwest is still recovering from summer flash floods. And if the water cycle whiplashes again, hard rain on parched earth would be another blow to farmers, already struggling to move their harvest.  Fewer and lighter barges on the river means more expensive trains and trucks putting more planet cooking pollution into Earth's system. And on a connected planet where one in eight humans eat something that was moved down the Mississippi, those hearty souls on the Dredge Potter are going to need a lot more help.

But everything from fuel leaks to hurricanes have already stalled the mission. Liftoff is now scheduled for November 14th and Artemis is back on the launch pad waiting for its big moment. But if you can't wait, there may be a way for you to get that moonwalking feeling right here on Earth. A new invention from Shift Robotics aims to make walking faster and more efficient. But will they revolutionize the way we walk? That remains to be seen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) XUNJIE ZHANG, CEO, SHIFT ROBOTICS:  Instead of replacing walking, what if we can augmenting or enhancing walking? REPORTER:  These are not roller skates, they are moonwalkers designed by Shift Robotics, a startup out of the robotics lab at Carnegie Mellon University. ZHANG:  I think the biggest problem is just the walking is too slow, it's super inefficient to get around by walking. So instead of replacing walking, what if we can you know augmenting or enhancing walking? REPORTER:  The company says these battery powered shoes can boost walking speeds up to seven miles an hour. Using a machine learning algorithm, Shift Robotics says the shoes can adapt to a user's walking pattern in real time. ZHANG:  You know, even though it has some elements of roller skate. You never freeloading, you just go -- they only move when you want to move. REPORTER:  Moonwalkers can fit most shoes with flexible straps that can be easily taken on and off with magnetic buckles. With speed limitation tech and braking systems the company claims the shoes are safe to use on on sidewalks or in crowded areas. ZHANG:  Outside the personal commuting or running errand scenes we think they're going to be great on distribution centers supermarket stores like warehouses for example where it's not fully automated but that still require lots of people walking around. REPORTER:  Shift Robotics also claims that users can walk over six miles after a single charge of an hour and a half. The company says it will deliver the first batch of shoes to consumers in March 2023 at nearly fourteen hundred dollars.  ZHANG:  I think at one day, you know, once we achieve economy scales, we will be able to drop the price we will be able to develop newer models that will allow us ultimately to drive the cost down.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is a hoot, a textbook example of parody by a parrot. TV reporter Nicholas Crum was in Chile telling a story about rising crime rates when a parrot pulls off an impeccable heist stealing the headphone right out of his ear. He gone. Crum, he needs to be more careful. He had someone else chase the thief for him so he could continue his report. Apparently, Crum suspected foul play. Well, the whole thing was caught on camera and where it is, he did get his headphone back. All right. Without feather ado, my favorite parrot of the day, I want to give a special shout out to West Side Middle School in Charleston, West Virginia.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, hello. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy. Grateful to be spending part of my day right here with you on CNN 10. Today is the first Tuesday in November and that means election day across America. Millions of Americans head to the polls to cast their ballots but they won't be choosing the next U.S. president. Americans will cast their votes for representatives in Congress and candidates for state and local offices.  Every two years, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for election while only about a third of the 100-seat Senate are up for grabs. These are called midterm elections because they happen two years into a U.S. president's four-year term. The midterms are the first chance for voters to weigh in on President Biden's term, policies and vision for America. All eyes are on Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania, four states that President Biden flipped to Democrat in the election but are now battlegrounds states that Republicans could win back. Issues at the top of mind for voters are, the economy, social issues, immigration, concerns about violent crime and concerns about election security and the election process itself.  This year, early voting has surged in some key states, including Georgia, which shattered records for early voter turnout but rain forecasted across the country today could impact voter turnout on election day. We'll hear more now from CNN's Karin Caifa about today's elections and what Americans might expect as results come in. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARIN CAIFA, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  President Joe Biden isn't on the ballot, but for most Americans, it's their first chance to weigh in on his party and policies. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This election isn't a referendum, it's a choice. It's a choice between two fundamentally different visions of America. CAIFA:  Among states taking center stage in the battle for the U.S. Senate tight races in four that president Biden flipped in the 2020 presidential election, Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania were Biden and former President Barack Obama stumped Saturday. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT:  Democracy itself is on the ballot. The stakes are high.  CAIFA:  And former President Donald Trump also rallied. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT:  This election is your chance to make your voice heard. CAIFA:  Underscoring how 2022 may foreshadow the 2024 presidential contest. Polls indicate most voters are looking at the economy right now as they cast ballots. Democrats touted Friday's October jobs report and unemployment still near a half century low as assigned their economic policies are working, while Republicans point to the highest inflation in 40 years.  SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI):  The inflation crushing our pocketbooks, can't fill up our tank, can't fill up our grocery cart. CAIFA:  Democrats hope the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June will motivate voters, especially women, while Republicans have accused Democrats of being weak on crime especially in major cities.  Both parties eager to drive turnout in their favor. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Name the peninsula in Egypt located between the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea. Sinai, Iberian, Arabian or Yucatan? Sinai peninsula is the answer here and at the southern tip is where you'll find the Egyptian city of Sharm El-sheikh. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  This week and next in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, tens of thousands of world leaders, representatives, negotiators, businesses and citizens will gather for the COP27 Conference. Twenty-seven because this is the 27th year that the global climate summit has been held. The focus of these conferences is climate change. The U.N. says this was a fringe issue when the summits began, but it's now a global priority though different nations have different levels of commitment to it. Carbon dioxide emissions are front and center here. Most scientists say these emissions are harming the global environment by causing earth's average temperatures to rise a smaller group of scientists says that climate change happens naturally and that the earth can absorb human carbon emissions. But the goal of these U.N. summits is for member countries to lay out new plans to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide. Let's take a look now at the history of these COP conferences as nations continue to debate the issues that relate to the health of the planet. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  COP stands for Conference of the Parties. The gatherings are intense technical negotiations brokered by the U.N. Countries are meant to work together to coordinate a global effort to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. But progress at successive COP summits has been limited. RAUL ESTRADA-OYUELA, KYOTO COP3 CHAIRMAN:  This is a very long process. It will take decades. PAULA DOBRIANSKY, HEAD OF U.S. DELEGATION, BALI, COP13:  We will go forward and join consensus in this today. LEONARDO DICAPRIO, UN MESSENGER OF PEACE: Now must be our moment for action. REPORTER:  The first climate COP summit took place in Berlin in 1995, and representatives from more than states or territories attended. Two years later, progress. The parties at COP3 in Japan agreed to the Kyoto Protocol in which 37 industrialized states or territories were legally bound to start reducing their emissions.  But the biggest polluter at the time the United States refused to ratify the agreement because it didn't oblige developing nations like China to cut emissions. In the following years, climate change slipped on and off the global agenda. After 9/11, the world's attention shifted to fighting international terrorism. Climate issues took a back seat. All the while, greenhouse gas emissions continue to soar and without the United States and China on board, the Kyoto protocol began to crumble, successive climate summits produced few results. COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009 was highly anticipated, but fell short.  BUYELWA SONJICA, SOUTH AFRICAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTER:  It's not acceptable. It's definitely not acceptable. It's disappointing. REPORTER:  Then at COP21 in Paris, there was a breakthrough. In 2015, the Paris agreement was adopted by more than 190 parties, including the U.S. and China, and effectively replaced Kyoto. Its ambition was to limit global warming to well below two, but preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But the watchdog Climate Action Tracker shows that all major economies are off track to meeting their obligations to contain temperature rise and as governments lagged in fulfilling their pledges a new wave of youth-led environmental activism was born. GRETA THUNBERG, CLIMATE ACTIVIST:  All what you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you? DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, before Paris, France. REPORTER:  Then, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris agreement, only for his successor President Biden to bring the U.S. back into it.  JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  This moment demands urgency. Good ideas and good intentions aren't good enough. REPORTER:  At COP26 in Glasgow, developed countries pledged $100 billion annually to support developing countries in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting their economies.  But the conference also had its shortcomings. India successfully demanded that the final agreement would commit countries to phase down rather than phase out coal. JOURNALIST:  It's according to science, sir. It's according to science. BHUPENDER YADAV, INDIAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTER:  No, not at all. REPORTER:  Fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas emit heat trapping greenhouse gas emissions. And if we don't cut those emissions dramatically, scientists predict global temperatures could warm by three degrees by the end of the century. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Now for today's 10 out of 10, we're bringing you a tasty story that's going to wake you up. People deep-fry chicken, they deep-fry potatoes. I've even heard of deep fried Oreos.  But coffee? How to even do that? James Hoffman, a coffee connoisseur and author, deep fried the coffee beans for 14-1/2 minutes. And he says it created a soft and buttery cup of Joe rich but not greasy, I guess you could deep fry just about anything. I think my weakness is French fries. I can eat them all day, every day.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Wonderful Wednesday to you. I know we're just halfway through the week, but we're going to keep on grinding and shining because that's just what we do. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10 and we've got a rendezvous with the news. Yesterday was election day in America. Millions of adults all across the country went to the polls to cast their votes for representatives in Congress, senators and state and local officials. The results were still coming in when we produced this show for the latest info check out CNN.com where results are updated in real time. But between early voting which shattered state records in Georgia and absentee ballots and the sheer volume of votes on election day it could be a while before we know who the winners are all eyes are on the results in Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania, battleground states that Biden flipped to Democratic states in the 2020 presidential election. But now, Republicans are hoping to gain control there. Experts say the 2022 midterm results could foreshadow the 2024 presidential contest. Polls indicate that most voters rank the economy as the number one issue on their minds, but women's rights, guns and public safety as well as immigration and election security are also major issues that are important to voters in this election. Let's hear now from chief national correspondent John King in the election center who explains the early signs he's looking for as election results come in. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Let's start in the House. JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Four hundred thirty-five races in all, under new lines because of the census two years ago, the redistricting process. As you know better than anybody, they're not all competitive. So, what we've done is we've identified working with our partners at inside elections, 82 competitive seats heading into election day. And as you can see, they are coast to coast. Another way to look at it, look at this, just to understand Democrats are on defense. It's a Democratic president's first midterm. It's a tough climate, just look down here at the key to these seats. BASH:  Yeah. KING:  Fifty-seven of the competitive seats have Democratic incumbents almost three times as many, almost three times as many of Republicans. There are three new seats here too as you look at the map. So Democrats are on their heels defending much more territory in a tough year. That's one way to look at it. Now let's bring it up, the big question is, who can get to 2018, right? And in our rankings right now, we already have Republicans favored in seats. Now some of those are just barely favored you see the lighter red on the map. But Republicans have a huge advantage going into election day and if you look down and, you know, the race is very well. These toss-up races go coast to coast. BASH:  Let's look at the Senate. Obviously right now, 50-50. KING:  Right. BASH:  It could go so many different ways. KING:  The chess game here, you can game it out. Reasonably, Democrats winning here, Republicans winning there were elections in all. Again, you work with -- we've worked with our partners here to identify the competitive seats. Eight elections of the Senate, we view as competitive. It could be more. Republicans think they could surprise us in some places of these eight. They're evenly divided now between held by Democrats or held by Republicans. Best way to look at this is to come into the balance of power as you come into the control right now. Again, Democrats enter the election, 50-50. The vice president United States breaks the ties. So Democrats can't afford to lose essentially. And so, you have the states on the map if you come in now to how we rank them, the goal or the toss-up states, one is a Republican held state right now, no incumbent Pennsylvania, Democratic incumbent in Georgia, the probably the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent you were just out there in Nevada. BASH:  Yeah. KING:  This is where the chess gets fascinating. BASH:  Yeah. And so many -- I mean, you're saying that these yellow are maybe the tightest, but that might belie what we're actually seeing on the ground, which is a wider swath of really, really tight races. KING:  But it is possible, again, we know these races are competitive right. But we still tilt New Hampshire Democratic, Republicans think they can pick up that seat. We still tilt Arizona Democratic; Republicans think that one is within their reach. They say watch, we still have -- this as likely Dem up in Washington state, in Colorado, Republicans say keep an eye on everything. So you could -- you conceivably could get Republicans to 52 or 53. You can also get the Democrats to 51 or stay status quo at 50. Again, this race could decide the Senate. In the end, does anybody get above or are we going are we going another month? BASH:  Or are we going to be standing here in December? KING:  On December 6th, but you were just out here. This is what Democrats worry about most. They view Catherine Cortez Masto as the most vulnerable Democrat and again think about the math, right? We won't know that one because it's out west, right? The Democrats would love to pick up Pennsylvania as a safety valve an insurance policy against maybe losing out in Nevada. BASH:  It is going to be a long and very exciting night. KING:  Week. BASH:  Maybe week. John King, thank you. KING:  Thank you. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In what sport would you find a gully, sweeper and a wicket keeper? Curling, bowling, cricket or lacrosse? The answer here is cricket in which the only field are allowed to wear gloves is called the wicket keeper. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Our next story involves the sport of cricket but it's about so much more than the intricacies of the game. It showcases a much broader dynamic of sports and highlights the importance of camaraderie, lifting each other up and setting aside differences to work together towards something greater than ourselves. Steffan Nero is visually impaired. He struggled to fit in, but his life changed when he found his squad, and he's gone on to shatter records. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUBTITLE:  Steffan Nero is not your average athlete. Born with two visual impairments, he struggled at school, failing to find a place where he felt he fitted in. After discovering visually impaired sports, Australian Nero started playing blind cricket and found new horizons. STEFFAN NERO, BLIND CRICKETER:  Sport is for me is such a big part of my life. like I can't really understate it, to be honest. I never really connected with other people my age regarding, you know, just obviously other people who didn't have the same obviously sight condition as me. But I usually felt quite lonely at high in high school. Sport, I would say, really changed my life and really pushed me to realize that I do have a lot of potential. I'd say I've flourished in a way. I became much more confident in myself. Part of a family, you're part of a group, you all dealt with the same experiences. You can speak to each other, and that's something that I really needed when I was growing up, because I think without it I've been a much more -- much different situation without those kinds of experiences. SUBTITLE:  Blind cricket differs from the able-bodied version in a number of ways. Players of varying visual impairments bowl a ball with internal bearings underhanded, allowing it to be heard. Nero etched his name into sporting history when he scored a record-breaking 309 not out innings against New Zealand. NERO:  Once I got the 300-mark, I was just like, okay, this is, you know, I can even make history here. When everyone was clapping as well, it was amazing feeling to experience and something I could say I'll never forget for the rest of my life. Obviously, it wasn't just me, but it was the team and my coaching staff, everyone, my parents, everyone. But still my name was said, Steffan Nero has made 309. So still a very special moment. SUBTITLE:  Although the response was overwhelmingly positive, there were still some negative comments around the record. NERO:  Majority of people obviously very crisp of saying, oh, wow, didn't realize this game that I think it can -- it helps to kind of change people's minds a bit about what disability means as well. I did hear a few comments saying oh you know it's just disability cricket. You know that kind of thing. But like I said a lot of people just making jokes about it as well, which happens, you know, that's the way it is on social media. After a while, I stopped looking at the comments and stuff as well and just kind of just ignored it and said, you know what, this is something that I think is really positive for blind cricket, for people with disabilities in Australia as well. SUBTITLE:  As well as furthering the sport, Nero wants to use his position to inspire the next generation. NERO:  I always say, if you try something, you don't like it, then that's fine. Unless you've tried it, you know, you're taking that first step. It probably will be the hardest thing you ever do, but once it happens and you're involved in that kind of group and that community, I think things get much easier and can be quite a really rewarding experience. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10 story might cause an uproar, and I ain't even lying. The Oklahoma City zoo needs names for its litter of African lion cubs, and it's asking the public to pick 'em. Born September 26 at the zoo's lion overlook habitat, these cute baby lions are the zoo's first in 15 years. Before the cubs are old enough to be put in public display though, they need names. But before you toss out names like Santa Claws (ph), Empe-roar (ph), or Kitty Purrie (ph), you have to cast your vote on a pre-approved name on a list on the zoo's website. Shout out time now. High five and a high 10 to Maclay Middle School in Tallahassee, Florida. Hope you all have a happy day. And remember, happiness isn't some idea that we have to chase or find or create. Happiness is right here, right now, whenever we choose to embrace it. Much love and many blessings. I'm Coy and this is CNN 10. END221110

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. I'm Coy Wire. Here to help you jump-start your week with the best minutes in news right here on CNN 10.  let's start today with an update on the midterm elections. Last week, millions of adults across the country went to the polls to cast their votes for representatives in Congress senators and state and local officials Democrats performed better than predicted. They are projected to retain majority control of the U.S. Senate after winning a pivotal race in Nevada.  Now Democrats will hold 50 Senate seats with Republicans currently holding 49. A December runoff election in the state of Georgia could earn Republicans a matching 50th Senate seat but Democrats would still hold a tie-breaking vote in the Senate which belongs to Vice President Kamala Harris. But the race isn't over yet Republicans may win the House of Representatives as votes continue to be tallied from a handful of districts. If Republicans win the House, they could still stop a significant portion of President Biden's Democratic agenda in his medical proposals. Congress makes nationwide laws. The House decides which laws are voted on, while the Senate can approve or block them and confirm appointments made by the president. Let's hear now from CNN's Jessica Schneider, a justice correspondent based in Washington. She has an update on President Biden's proposal to forgive some student loan debt which would need clear congressional authorization to go through. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  A federal judge out of Texas who is actually nominated by President Trump is now saying President Biden just does not have the power to forgive these student loans by executive order and instead, President Biden would need clear congressional authorization to forgive these loans and he would have had to go through more of a process rather than just simply issuing an executive order.  However, we will see an appeal of this decision. The Justice Department has already noticed that it will appeal and this is ultimately a decision that could be determined by the Supreme Court. Of course, President Biden issued this executive order in August. It's estimated that if it goes through, it would ultimately cost about $400 billion.  The program though now in doubt, and it's also been on hold for the past month because of another court decision out of a circuit court that put the loan forgiveness rollout on hold while all these legal challenges play out.  You know, we know that about 26 million borrowers already have applied for this debt relief. The government had already approved million of those applications, but no debt at all will be canceled for the foreseeable future here because of these court challenges. The White House press secretary did however say that the Department of Education will hold on to the information of all of these applicants so it could be processed pretty quickly if the program is ultimately given the green light in court. But we'll have to see how the courts decide this. If it does go all the way to the Supreme Court, it's possible that the conservative majority on the Supreme Court could nix this program as well. You know this has been a majority that's often skeptical of wide-ranging executive and agency action, so this debt forgiveness program could ultimately. Be deemed unconstitutional and if that happens none of these millions of people would get any debt relief. But for now this program is also on hold. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, a film crew searching the Atlantic Ocean for World War II artifacts unexpectedly swam upon something much more modern, a 20-foot long piece of the Space Shuttle Challenger which exploded shortly after liftoff in 1986. CNN's space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT:  It was the space shuttle's very distinctive heat shield tiles that really gave these divers their first clue that perhaps they had found a piece of NASA's old space shuttle Challenger and you can see in the video these white square tiles that are you know partially covered by sand now in the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean and those white tiles would have been used to protect the underbelly of the space shuttle from the very high temperatures that it would encounter as it re-entered the earth's atmosphere.  So the lead team member on this expedition, the guy by the name of Mike Barnett, he had a friend who was a former NASA astronaut. He showed him this video and that made them convinced that this is indeed what they had found. They brought it to NASA and NASA confirmed it, announcing the findings just this week. And so, the big question now is what does NASA do with this? By law, any piece of a space shuttle is NASA property. So NASA is trying to find a way to do something with this 20-feet section to do something that would really honor the memory of these seven astronauts that were killed back in January of 1986, including Christa McAuliffe who of course would have been the very first teacher in space. Kristin Fisher, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which U.S. government agency measures job market activity and working conditions? Department of Commerce, Department of State, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics? The Bureau of Labor Statistics serves as the statistical resource for the U.S. Department of Labor. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  For the past year, the job market has been strong. In October, the economy created 261,000 new jobs. But things may not quite be what they seem. Job hires dropped to a low not seen in more than a year and a half.  We'll hear now from CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich who's finding out why getting a job might not be as easy as some might think, and how some people are getting creative to get noticed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARLY PAVLINAC, JOB SEEKER:  I'm open to all options. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Karly Pavlinac is on stage in a high-stakes competition. The potential prize: a new job. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How do you make sure you're working with the right talent, you're finding the right connections? PAVLINAC:  The biggest thing is just being able to communicate the idea. YURKEVICH:  This is not the first time Pavlinac has done something unconventional to land an interview, since losing her marketing job in September. After she didn't hear back for a position at Nike, she sent them a cake with her resume on it.  PAVLINAC:  I've been applying obviously that hasn't worked yet, so let me throw something new in the mix and see if that you know works. YURKEVICH:  Her resume cake making headlines.  PAVLINAC:  I've since talked to a bunch of people at Nike but still no job. YURKEVICH:  But the economic data tells a different story. The jobs market is strong. There are 10.7 million open positions, labor shortages and hundreds of thousands of jobs being added each month.  Yet some job seekers even with a viral cake moment can't seem to land one. LIZ ANN SONDERS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST:  On the surface, this is still fairly strong labor market. But if you go a couple of layers under, you are starting to see more significant cracks in the surface that suggest we should eventually see it in those more popular headline type labor market readings. YURKEVICH:  Cracks like a slowdown in hiring, as seen in this week's job opening survey. Hires dropping to 6.1 million, the lowest since February 2021, and the tech industry is shutting jobs percent more than last year.  PAVLINAC:  My perception of the job market was there were a ton of jobs out there and it was going to be easy to find a job, and that actually hasn't been the case. YURKEVICH:  Another crack of the 10.7 million open jobs, some companies might be advertising positions they aren't actively trying to fill. PAVLINAC:  I have applied to many jobs that they're still sitting there, that's been a giant question in my head.  YURKEVICH:  It's called pipelining talent. Companies post jobs to develop a pool of candidates. Recruiter Laura Mazzullo says she sees companies do it all the time. LAURA MAZZULLO, FOUNDER, EAST SIDE STAFFING:  Candidates don't know that's what's happening. So they're being pipelined when actually they think they're applying for an active job and this is where we're seeing a bit of a disconnect.  YURKEVICH:  That may mean as the labor market weakens, job seekers can't be as picky. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our goal is potentially to give away two jobs tonight. PAVLINAC:  I have been picking in that sense of where I want to work but I know what I want. I'm still searching, still talking to people. I've come to terms that it is taking longer than I thought. YURKEVICH:  Vanessa Yurkevich, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10 is from Minnesota man James Rasmussen as we head into the holiday season. He's hoping to avoid the terra bowel experience he had last season. He couldn't figure out who-who was cutting his outdoor Christmas lights. Turns out it was the owl who stole Christmas, using the lights to deck its own halls, its nest under Rasmussen's deck. Critters, there's no talon what they'll do. Better luck nest time Mr. Rasmussen. Without further owl do, a special shout out now to Ryan Middle in Fairbanks, Alaska. Wishing you and everyone watching around the world some motivation this Monday.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy. Grateful to be spending part of my day with you right here on CNN 10. We have a great show today, so let's get to it. We're going to begin with the news out of Bali where the G20 Summit is taking place. The global 20 is an intergovernmental forum between countries that addresses major issues related to the global economy. President Joe Biden held a three-hour talk Monday with the president of China, Xi Jinping. The meeting was their first in-person encounter since President Biden took office and an opportunity for both countries to improve deteriorating relations. Dialogue between them hit a new low in August when U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, a choice that upset China. Expectations for major change were low headed into the meeting. The White House said in a statement afterwards that President Biden raised concerns about China's human rights violations, but that the two countries found areas of agreement especially when it came to the war in Ukraine. In addition, the two nations promised to work together on global climate issues, world health and food security, and they pledge to keep communication open. But at the heart of the U.S.-Chinese relations is the Taiwan question. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Will Ripley in Taipei. The capital of ROC, the Republic of China, commonly known as Taiwan. This island is a vibrant democracy of $23 million people and a key ally of the United States, about 100 miles from mainland China. SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  And I'm Selina Wang in Beijing the capital of China, officially called the People's Republic of China. The PRC was founded in by the victorious Communist Party after a bloody civil war. RIPLEY:  On the losing side, the nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek who had ruled since the 1920s, they fled here to Taiwan where the ROC flag still flies today. Two sides both claiming control of one country, a decades-long dispute, halting travel and trade and leaving a lingering threat of war. WANG:  Initially, both the United States and the United Nations recognized Taipei as the seat of the Chinese government. But amid the shifting political relations at the height of the Cold War, that changed in the 1970s. The PRC replaced the ROC at the U.N. and the United States changed diplomatic relations. It moved its embassy from Taipei to here in Beijing. While the U.S. has adopted a so-called one China policy, it has never recognized the communist party sovereign claim over Taiwan. Washington continues to sell weapons to Taipei, but it has remained deliberately unclear about whether it would come to Taiwan's defense in the event of a Chinese invasion. It keeps Beijing guessing. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You know, you hear people saying Biden wants to start a new Cold War with China. I don't want a cold war with China. I just want to make China understand that we are not going to step back. We are not going to change any of our views. RIPLEY:  That looming threat of invasion is only part of China's ongoing campaign to squeeze Taiwan. Decades of diplomatic pressure by Beijing means this island has very few formal diplomatic allies, because any nation that wants to normalize relations with China has to sever formal diplomatic ties with Taipei. The island's Olympic team can't even carry the Taiwanese flag. They have to compete under the name Chinese Taipei. In Singapore, in 1992, the two sides did agree at least in theory to the existence of one China. WANG:  It's impossible to overstate just how important Taiwan is to the ruling communist party and its legitimacy. China sees the self-ruled island as a breakaway province that must be reunified with the mainland, even by force if necessary. Reunification is also rooted in the communist party's goal to reverse China's century of humiliation by colonial powers. That means returning China's borders to something more like that of the Qing Empire. It's the basis of modern China's claims to Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong and Taiwan. RIPLEY:  Putting sovereignty on the back burner gave Taiwan's economy a boost. Cross strait trade, tourism and money moving again. In 2015, the ruling parties on both sides met again in Singapore, a historic summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Taiwan's then President Ma Ying-jeou. One year later, a turning point. Taiwan's 2016 election of Tsai Ing-wen, the island's first female president, leading a longtime pro-independence party. Tensions rising ever since, something Taiwan blames on China's plan to push its power across the Indo-Pacific. Taiwan's young democracy divided on the issue of unification with the mainland. The tide is turning. In 2020, Tsai won a landslide re-election, vowing to defend Taiwan's democracy from she's increasingly powerful and authoritarian China. Cross strait ties plunging to their lowest level in decades. TSAI ING-WEN, PRESIDENT OF TAIWAN (translated):  The broadest consensus among the Taiwanese people and our various political parties is that we must defend our national sovereignty, our free and democratic way of life. On this point, we have no room for compromise. WANG:  With U.S.-China tensions at an all-time high, Washington and Taipei have moved closer. In 2016, then U.S. President-elect Donald Trump broke a decade-long precedent and spoke to President Tsai on the phone. He also elevated official exchanges between Washington and Taipei, a move that infuriated Beijing. RIPLEY:  China's refusal to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine has many here asking, what is Beijing planning for Taiwan, testing the island's defenses, flying scores of warplanes near the island, making President Xi's long-standing calls for peaceful reunification ring hollow? REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  We will not allow China to isolate Taiwan. RIPLEY:  In August 2022, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi became the highest ranking U.S. lawmaker to visit this island in 25 years, a move Beijing call a major political provocation. In response, China launched military exercises beyond the median line encircling the island. During her visit, Pelosi delivered the unequivocal message that America stands with Taiwan. But if the time comes, would the U.S. send in American troops to defend this Chinese-speaking democracy, a democracy with an uncertain future? (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: When compared to Earth, the atmosphere of Mars is? Thinner, thicker, or about the same? The atmosphere of Mars is over 100 times thinner than Earth. And actually, that thin atmosphere on Mars presents challenges for NASA. (END VIDEO CLIP) A new initiative from NASA called LOFTID could be a potential solution and will determine if a giant inflatable shield could protect spacecrafts against the heat of re-entering the atmosphere. The shield can withstand 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit and at feet in diameter, it's also the largest blunt object ever to return from space. The technology would help spacecrafts enter Mars's thin atmosphere because the Martian atmosphere can't decelerate a spacecraft as quickly and coolly as Earth's atmosphere. And we're ending today's show with a bang for 10 out of 10. Check out this massive explosion in western Kentucky. Drop them like it's hot. These three structures are actually cooling towers at a closed coal plant. The towers were 435 feet tall until they weren't. Tennessee Valley Authorities said the blast was done on purpose to clear the land for future use. The dramatic footage shows the towers slowly collapsing to the ground with clouds of dust all around. The Drakesboro, Kentucky, plant was active for nearly 60 years before effectively closing in 2020. And now to my favorite part of the day, I want to give a special shout out to Crown Point High School in Crown Point, Indiana. Go Bulldogs! Thank you so much for watching.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, everyone? It's Wednesday. Are you hanging in there? Let's smell the flowers and cool the soup.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10.  Just a few more days and we are on the Thanksgiving break. So let's rock. We're going to start today though with news out of India, where air quality is an ongoing issue.  New Delhi, India, is the world's most polluted capital according to IQAir, a Swiss company that measures air quality. It's blanketed in smog every winter as the cold air traps dust in the atmosphere above the city.  In March of this year, firefighters battled ablaze in New Delhi at a landfill site. The fire cloaked the area in a toxic haze and smoke choked residents for days. Factories, construction sites and primary schools were ordered to shut down, and Delhi authorities urged people to work from home. There's currently a debate in India over how to handle waste. There's no processing of waste in most Indian cities, according to the government's central pollution board and in some cases trash is simply burned in open dump yards on the roads. Delhi's 24-hour air quality index measures the concentration of harmful pollutants. Anything over 300 is considered hazardous and New Delhi's levels are as high as 470. The government is attempting to take stricter measures to tackle air quality as there are major health concerns for citizens in India.  We'll hear more now from Vedika Sud, a CNN reporter based at the New Delhi bureau who will introduce us to some of the people impacted by the poor air quality and explain the science behind the toxic air. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  Seventy-two-year-old shopkeeper Narayan Choudhary suffers from chronic asthma. He says he almost died in April this year after the landfill behind his house which is the size of a village caught fire.  NARAYAN CHOUDHARY, SHOPKEEPER (through translator):  It was a massive blade. It was difficult to survive. My face and nose started swelling. I was gasping for breath. I could barely drink or eat. SUD:  Choudhary says had it not been for his friend who rushed him to hospital, he wouldn't be here today. It was a dangerous combination of methane, unsegregated garbage and record high temperatures earlier this year that sparked massive fires not only at the Bhalswa landfill but also here at one of Asia's biggest dump sites. Government data from 2019 says this Ghazipur landfill is almost stories tall and the size of s soccer fields. Methane is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas and one company GHGSat found on a single day in March as trash decomposed more than two metric tons of methane gas leaked every hour from the Ghazipur landfill. STEPHANE GERMAIN, CEO, GHGSAT:  When we take all the measurements that we took over a period of about a year, we found that the total emissions were equivalent to emissions from approximately 350,000 U.S. passenger vehicles per year. SUD:  And methane emissions aren't the only hazard. Dangerous toxins from landfills seep into the ground polluting the water supply for thousands of residents living nearby. That's the color of the water, a pale, dirty yellow and we're barely hundred meters away from the foothill of the landfill. In May, CNN commissioned two accredited labs to test the groundwater around the Bhalswa landfill. The result, the groundwater within at least a 500-  meter radius around the wayside is contaminated. According to the labs, it's unfit for drinking.  In the first lab report, the total dissolves solids from all three samples were off the charts. Amid other parameters, levels of ammonia and sulfate was significantly higher than acceptable limits mandated by the Indian government. Results from the second lab report were equally worrying. Also iron traces in the first sample for both lab reports were at least eight times more than the permissible limit. And while authorities bring in a supply of clean water, residents say they're simply not enough for this densely populated neighborhood, and that they must buy and consume purified water.  As part of his Clean India Initiative, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said efforts are being made to remove these mountains of garbage and convert them into green zones. That goal if achieved could stem the suffering of those residents living in the shadows of these dump sites and go a long way to curb the massive amounts of methane being released into the atmosphere.  With more than 3,100 landfills, the task is monumental and so far unrealized. And if decisive action isn't taken soon, the consequences on the global climate fight could be catastrophic and the toll on human life unimaginable. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In what U.S. city would you find the famous museum complex nickname "the nation's attic"? New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles or Raleigh? The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. is home to 19 museums, 21 libraries and is home to over 154 million eclectic holdings. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Up next, we're traveling to Raleigh, North Carolina, to show you how big tech is making that city one of the fastest growing in the United States. Raleigh even gained the recognition as the Smithsonian of the South because of its booming art scene and all the free museums you can choose from. Let's check it out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  If you were to list the great art and educational centers of the U.S., you might think of New York or D.C. But you might be missing one, here, Raleigh, North Carolina. Raleigh has long been a museum Mecca with a vibrant art scene. Now, big companies like Google and Apple are moving into the area, helping to make it one of the fastest growing cities in the U.S. And as the city's grown, Raleigh has gained more recognition as a cultural destination. The area boasts more than locally owned art galleries, over 60 performing art spaces, and 140 pieces of public art in the downtown area, not to mention over 50 historic sites and 17 museums, most of which are free, leading some people to call Raleigh and its abundance of cultural institutions the Smithsonian of the south. VALERIE HILLINGS, DIRECTOR AND CEO, NORTH CAROLINA MUSEUM OF ART:  The state of North Carolina from the 20th century realized what an important thing it was to offer to its citizens free museums, giving everyone an opportunity to learn about and experience different subjects. We opened our doors in 1956. REPORTER:  The North Carolina museum of arts collection stretches across different cultures and eras. It has dedicated galleries to Rodin, Jewish ceremonial art. It even has an infinity mirror room sculpture by Yayoi Kusama, who has been nicknamed the most Instagramed artist in the world. HILLINGS:  As I like to say, all art is once contemporary and all art becomes history. We began to move single artworks around into other galleries, unexpected galleries, that really changed how people saw this collection. One of the Wileys has been a real fan favorite as it's been paired with an earlier portrait of King Louis showing two young men having a great sense of swagger., REPORTER:  The museum also has the largest connected art park in the country, at a whopping 164 acres. HILLINGS:  It becomes like an outdoor art gallery. REPORTER:  The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences is the largest of its kind in the Southeast and home to millions of plants animals gems and to the second biggest earth on Earth. CHRIS SMITH, COORDINATOR OF CURRENT SCIENCE PROGRAMS, NC MUSEUM OF NATURALK SCIENCES:  It's accurate down to the most minute detail. There's a lot of great ways to get close to nature here at the museum and a lot of great ways to learn about what's going on in the state of North Carolina.  One of the main highlights, the reasons to come visit are the whale skeletons. That whale the Smithsonian tried to take it and we were like no, we want it. These are dinosaurs that would have lived in prehistoric North Carolina. This is an eastern glass lizard and very active this morning good to see him out. There are 50 states, North Carolina is the best because North Carolina has a little bit of everything that everybody loves. REPORTER:  Whether you're interested in history, modern art or even Harley- Davidson drag racing, Raleigh's got you covered. HILLINGS:  Many of the things you can see not only in New York but at museums worldwide, you can see here in North Carolina. But also you can see things you won't see anywhere else.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANNOUNCER:  Five, four, stage engine start, three, two, one -- booster's ignition and liftoff of Artemis I. We rise together back to the moon and beyond. (END VIDEO CLIP) COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Happy Thursday, everyone, or as I like to say happy Friday eve. I'm Coy. Thankful to be hanging out with you. Time for the best 10 minutes in news right here on CNN 10. Let's rise together. We start today with the liftoff of the rocket we just saw. Yesterday, NASA launching its long-awaited Artemis moon rocket. The mission was a long time and a lot of money coming. NASA has spent more than billion dollars to date getting Artemis off the ground. But there were scrubbed launches hurricanes and mechanical issues that delayed takeoff for months. But the rocket finally got off the ground. This mission kicks off a key test of America's ability to send astronauts back to the moon. Can you believe the last time humans were on the moon was way back in 1972? That's 50 years ago. But hold on a moon-it, there won't be any humans on the moon just yet. There's no crew for this expedition. The rocket will come within 60 miles of the lunar surface before flying forty thousand miles beyond the moon and then looping back to Earth over three weeks' time. The journey will conclude with a splash when the rocket lands at sea on December 11th. We're going to hear now from CNN's space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher about the first test flight of the Artemis moon rocket. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT:  This is, of course, an uncrewed first test flight for the Artemis moon rocket. It is a SLS rocket, the space launch system rocket, with the Orion crew capsule on top. And so, what we've seen over the last few hours is launch and then the capsule separating from the rocket, and the rocket falling back to earth. And now, this little capsule, the Orion capsule, is now making its way to the moon. It's going to take about five or six days to get there. When it gets there, it's going to fly by very close to the moon just about feet off the lunar surface before then traveling farther out into space than any spacecraft ever designed to carry humans has ever flown, before flying back to earth testing out that all-important heat shield at the base of the Orion capsule before splashing down into the ocean. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia, Thanksgiving themed. What type of food was definitely not present in 1600s New England when Pilgrims first arrived? Cranberries, pumpkin, potatoes or corn? Potatoes which are native to South America hadn't been introduced to North America yet. They weren't established crops there until the 1700s. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Officially, one week away from Thanksgiving now. What's your favorite thanksgiving side dish mashed potatoes cream corn cornbread or stuffing or dressing as some folks like to call it? Whatever you love, be sure to really love and appreciate it this Thanksgiving. Because due to inflation, Thanksgiving dinner will cost 20 percent more this year than last, and that was already considered the most expensive Thanksgiving ever. We'll hear now from chief business correspondent Christine Romans on what you and your families can expect at the grocery store this holiday season. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  On the menu this year for Thanksgiving, rising prices. Overall, prices are up 7.7 percent from last year and grocery prices are more than 12 percent higher than a year ago. Here's what it means for the family grocery bill as you shop for the big day. First, the turkey. Per pound prices for turkey are up 17 percent year-  over-year. An average frozen turkey costs roughly $2.38 cents a pound. That's up from a $1.74. Now you can blame the avian flu outbreaks and hire fuel feed and labor costs because of inflation running near 40-year highs. What about eggs? Eggs cost 43 percent more than a year ago. Butter and margarine are up 33 percent. Flour is up nearly 25 percent. Your pies are going to cost more to make. These higher prices could potentially change Thanksgiving plans. A new Wells Fargo report suggests some Americans may opt to eat out rather than shop and cook at home this year. Dining out also can be cost the report says, but it may be a better value than one might expect. Government data backs that up year over year the cost of dining out rose at a slower pace than the cost of a typical grocery store run. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Speaking of Thanksgiving grubbing, one of the best parts is eating leftovers in my opinion like for days and days, right? But we all know some people get skeezed out by that. Did you know though that the United States wastes 108 billion pounds of food each year? Well, maybe it doesn't have to be like that. CNN reported on the science behind food storage with expert tips on how to best store your food and to keep your leftovers from going bad. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  The kitchen is the heart of our homes and fortress for our fresh food. Taking pride of place, these gleaming apples and bananas might look safe now, but when you open the fridge or cupboards a few days later, you can find your once fresh ingredients in a very different condition. And this often comes down to how you put them away in the first place. BRITTANY TOWERS LEWIS, FOOD SCIENTIST:  A lot of food is wasted. People buy in bulk and then end up not eating it. REPORTER:  So much food in fact that if food loss and waste were a country it would be the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases. To keep food for longer and help the planet and your household budget in the process, there are a few things to keep in mind. LEWIS:  One is time. So obviously the longer you keep something, it will eventually go bad. Oxygen, there's a lot of reactions that happen if you've heard of oxidation. That kind of causes apples to go brown, for example when you cut them. Moisture can increase microbial growth, which is something that we want to prevent because obviously bacteria, molds, light can also cause foods to spoil a little faster. Like potatoes, they're exposed to light. They can turn green. They produce sprouts for example. REPORTER:  So, to avoid waking up to potatoes like this, you should keep them in a cool dark place, in a breathable bag to avoid moisture, and away from fruits such as bananas. This is because bananas are climacteric foods which means they produce a lot of ethylene. LEWIS:  Ethylene, very fancy term. It's a gas that causes fruits and vegetables to ripen. That's why a lot of times when people are like, hey, you want to ripen something put it in a bag with a banana, because bananas produce a lot of ethylene. So, it'll cause it to ripen faster. REPORTER:  Salad leaves are another victim of bad storage, resulting in this all too familiar kitchen scene. LEWIS:  If you notice kind of your leaves aren't lasting as long a really great way is to rinse them off and make sure they're completely dry. Vinegar not only will help kill or monitor bacteria but it's also very acidic. So, most bacteria also don't like acidic environments. REPORTER:  And remember the role moisture plays. LEWIS:  Bacteria love water and that's what they use to grow. So, the more water you try to take out, the longer that they last. So, if you put a little paper towel in, keep it in your refrigerator, that will help keep the lettuce a little longer. REPORTER:  But when it comes to herbs, a little H20 used correctly goes a long way. LEWIS:  If you cut the bottom stem part off and kind of put them in some water, in your refrigerator, that can help keep them a little longer. They're like a living plant. So, they're in their little water and they're drinking it up, instead of in like a bag from the grocery store that kind of just like harbors just bacteria because everything's like stuck together. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10 is fantastic. Scientists discovering never seen before deep sea creatures at the bottom of the Indian Ocean near the Cocos Islands, an Australian territory. These fish are freaky. There's a deep-sea batfish looking like a baby Yoda thingy. And then this previously unknown species of blind eel. I mean, it makes me wonder what else could be down there or do we even want to know? All right. All my so-fish-ticated folks, it's about that time. I want to give a special shout-out to Marianna High School in Marianna, Florida. We see you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. We made it to the weekend. Friday's rock especially when they lead into a nice long holiday vacation. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and we are pumped to be right here with you to finish this week strong. We're starting today by concluding our months-long coverage of the midterm elections. Let's reflect. On November 8th, Americans cast their votes for representatives in Congress which consists of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, and they also voted for candidates for state and local offices. The elections are called midterms because they happen in the middle of a president's four-year term. After a close race and days of counting ballots Democrats retained the Senate, while Republicans won the House of Representatives. This means Republicans can stop a significant portion of President Biden's Democratic agenda. Remember, Congress makes nationwide laws. The House decides which laws are voted on. The Senate can approve or block them and confirm appointments made by the president. The candidates who won their position will take office this January so we won't see any changes until then. Pretty soon, the next batch of candidates will start campaigning for the elections in 2024 where the big race will be for president of the United States. We'll be here through the whole process updating you on the latest with no opinion or slant, just the facts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What country will host the 2022 World Cup? Japan, France, Qatar or Australia? The Middle Eastern nation of Qatar will host the 2022 international soccer tournament which kicks off on Sunday. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  The World Cup, it's one of the most popular sporting events of all time. Every four years, the best players from across the planet represent their nations in an epic soccer tournament. The world cup kicking off this Sunday in Qatar is the men's tournament. The women's is next year, and more than one million people are expected to travel to Qatar. That's more than a third of the nation's entire population. This year's tourney has been described though as the "World Cup of chaos". For the first time ever, it's not being played in the traditional summer months because for the first time ever, it's in the Middle East where the Qatari desert would have been scorching hot during that time. So, players in top leagues across the world are having to play this World Cup in the middle of their club seasons, meaning they'll be exhausted. Also, the country of Qatar has been criticized for its human rights record. More now from CNN anchor and correspondent Isa Soares. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEPP BLATTER, FORMER FIFA PRESIDENT:  The winner to organize the 2022 FIFA World Cup is Qatar. ISA SOARES, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The sports world was stunned when FIFA awarded the World Cup to Qatar. Controversy took center stage and football risked becoming a sideshow. Why was Qatar, a tiny desert state with no football pedigree, chosen to host FIFA's showpiece event? Even the disgraced former chief of football's governing body has since described the decision as a mistake. BLATTER:  I was right at a certain time to say it is -- we should not go there. SOARES:  That move, 12 years ago, provoked unprecedented anger, accusations of corruption, and sportswashing. Qatari officials strongly denied the allegation that bribery was involved in their bid. Before a ball is kicked at the year's tournament, attention has focused on Qatar's human rights record. Its stance on same-sex relationship, and most damaging to its reputation, the treatment of overseas workers drafted in to build essential infrastructure. Amnesty International claims authorities failed to properly investigate the deaths of thousands of migrant workers despite evidence linking premature deaths with unsafe working conditions in the searing heat. Qatari officials say they investigate all reports of abuse and exploitation and are committed to holding unscrupulous employers to account. When the final whistle goes at Qatar 2022, the legacy will be judged not only over 28 days of football but in the years that lie ahead. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, this is a sad and uncertain time for many people across the tech industry. Many workers are scrambling to seek new opportunities. Fears of recession, rising interest rates and a shift to pre-pandemic lifestyles have all dealt major blows to the tech industry. More than 35,000 tech workers across 72 companies have been laid off just this month, for a total of 120,000 tech jobs lost this year. We'll hear now from CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich who has more on the future of the industry. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In three weeks, the tech industry lost tens of thousands of jobs. Historic layoffs at Twitter, Meta, Lyft and Amazon. Layoffs.fyi, a crowdsourced layoff tracking site, puts it at more than 35,000 layoffs so far this month. ROGER LEE, FOUNDER, LAYOFFS.FYI:  That's the highest month since the pandemic. So that beats April 2020, which was 17,000 employees laid off. YURKEVICH:  Meta cut its workforce by 13 percent. CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying he's taking accountability and apologizing to those impacted. New owner Elon Musk slashed half of Twitter staff with founder Jack Dorsey tweeting: The company grew too quickly, I apologize for that. And Amazon is laying off ten thousand workers this week, citing an unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment. NELA RICHARDSON, CHIEF ECONOMIS, ADP RESEARCH INSTITUTE:  There were big investments made during the pandemic time while the rest of the economy for example was plummeting by 3.4 percent. Tech grew by four percent. YURKEVICH:  But in a post-pandemic high inflation world, consumer behaviors and spending habits are changing, with the threat of recession on the horizon. RICHARDSON:  I take this as a sign that maybe companies got over their skis at some point right and they're trying to kind of sit upright again. YURKEVICH:  Roger Lee founded layoffs.fyi as the pandemic unfolded. Recently, he's been digging deeper into the numbers. LEE:  There have been many companies who have been letting go half or more of their recruiting HR teams just because they're not hiring as many people anymore. YURKEVICH:  Aaron Backman, a recruiter at a tech company, was one of those layoffs. What did that feel like for you? AARON BACKMAN, LAID OFF FROM TECH COMPANY:  It was a really awful feeling. We were told really early in the morning an email saying layoffs are coming today. And if you get a call, it's going to be you. And I sat there for six hours on slack and watched my colleagues get laid off one by one. YURKEVICH:  Then he got the call. BACKMAN:  It's depressing. YURKEVICH:  As American workers watch tech giants shed jobs at a rapid clip, many in other industries are asking, am I next? Should they be nervous? RICHARDSON:  First of all, the tech economy are just two percent of the labor market. Tech is an important part of the economy but it is not the whole of the economy. The rest of the labor market is looking pretty good. The economy is adding jobs at a pretty healthy clip. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's out 10 of 10 is quite relephant to what we do here at CNN 10.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, everyone?  Hope you had an awesome break and had some time to reflect on the things for which you are thankful, something for which I'm grateful is all of you and I am pumped to be right back at it so we can finish 2022 strong together, just 34 days remain in this year. We start today with news out of China. Protests have erupted all across the country, citizens taking to the streets in an unprecedented challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping's zero COVID policy. Hundreds of people in China shouting the phrases "Step down, Xi Jinping. Step down, communist party", and "Don't want COVID test, want freedom". The Chinese government has faced mounting anger at its zero COVID policy which attempts to isolate every case of COVID in the country and shut down the surrounding areas. Even almost three years into the pandemic, COVID tests, incessant lockdowns and quarantines have plagued the country. The protocols have kept China's infection rate lower than countries like the United States. The government, though, faces complaints about the economic and human cost as citizens are isolated for weeks at a time with limited access to food and medicine, while the country suffers economically.  A deadly fired an apartment block in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, killed 10 people and injured nine more on Thursday. After the event video suggested that COVID lockdown measures delayed firefighters from reaching the victims. The incident has been a further catalyst to the widespread anger and defiance against the government, which is rarely seen in China, a country where the communist party cracks down on all dissent. We'll hear more now from CNN international correspondent Selina Wang based at the network's Beijing bureau with more on this movement. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Anger is rising and tragedies are mounting but China shows no sign of budging on zero COVID. Authorities are clamping down with more lockdowns, mass testing and quarantine, and people are getting more and more frustrated. Adding to the anger is a fire that broke out in the capital of China's far west Xinjiang region on Thursday night. Ten people were killed and nine were injured in a fire at an apartment building in Urumqi.  Most parts of Xinjiang have been under lockdown for more than a hundred days. The deadly fire sparked nationwide outrage because widely circulated videos which have now been censored in China show that COVID measures, COVID lockdown measures very likely delayed firefighters from getting to the scene.  Now, state media claims that people in the compound were allowed to leave the building, that it was considered a low-risk COVID area. But video shows fire trucks unable to get close to the scene because the compound entrance was partially blocked. The video shows it's blocked with fences tents and metal barriers that are normally used as part of COVID measures.  The videos also show smoke and flames coming from a high floor of the building but the water failing to actually reach the fire. What adds to the tragedy is that those who died in the fire likely spent their last three months largely confined to that building if not entirely.  The fire really struck a cord with the public here because we've seen scenes of tragedy and suffering play out over and over again since the start of the pandemic. Countless stories of people struggling to get enough food daily necessities and emergency care and lockdown three years into these draconian policies, frustrations are more frequently turning into public protests which are normally rare and authoritarian China.  Last week, in the southern city of Guangzhou, some residents revolted during lockdown by tearing down barriers and marching through the streets. There were violent clashes at the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou this week. But still, there's no end in sight to zero COVID. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What type of star is the sun? Yellow Dwarf, Neutron Star, Red Dwarf, or Supernova? According to NASA, the sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old Yellow Dwarf star, at the center of our solar system. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next up, we'll hear how Heliogen, a renewable energy company in California's Mojave Desert, is using concentrated sunlight to power more than just your home. This new tech startup wants to replace fossil fuels with concentrated sunlight. But unlike traditional green energy suppliers, this startup is able to store fuel to create power even when it's dark outside or cloudy.  But while the company has major financial backers, it's not a perfect solution. Stock prices are low and some question whether Heliogen can execute on a large scale. We'll hear now from CNN business producer Jon Sarlin. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JON SARLIN, CNN BUSINESS PRODUCER (voice-over):  In California's Mojave Desert, renewable energy company Heliogen is working to harness concentrated sunlight for more than just powering your home. Using artificial intelligence, these mirrors can produce the extremely high temperatures needed to make things like concrete, steel and green hydrogen. So behind you are these mirrors reflecting light. Tell me what they're -- what are they doing? BILL GROSS, FOUNDER AND CEO, HELIOGEN:  We're taking a field of mirrors. Each one of them being moved precisely by computer algorithms to reflect the sunlight to a single spot up on the tower behind us. At that single spot, we're achieving temperatures that are almost a third the temperature of the surface of the sun.  SARLIN:  What do you turn what these mirrors are projecting into? GROSS:  The end result is we get very high temperatures so we can make steam for heavy industry, we can melt aluminum, we can melt steel, we can make concrete.  SARLIN:  It's the algorithm that separates Heliogen from other concentrated solar power ventures. Heliogen doesn't need complex mirrors. Instead, they use cameras and computing power to align their mirrors to reflect sunlight onto a refinery tower. This process creates temperatures of about a thousand degrees Celsius and all of that heat is directed and stored in big thermos-like containers. GROSS:  So the energy continues after the sun goes down or even on cloudy days. We hold enough energy for a week of no sunshine, so that industry can run 24/7.  SARLIN:  Concentrated solar power is a renewable energy resource that's been around for decades to generate power, but with mixed success. Its primary disadvantage has always been the hours of the day the sun isn't shining.  Heliogen's process solves this problem by storing its heat and making green fuel like hydrogen that can be used to fuel electric generating stations. Okay. So you have this concentrated light source. You're using it for power, for industrial uses, and for what else? GROSS:  Because we have continuous electricity. We can make hydrogen. So hydrogen is a miracle substance. It's the most common element on earth.  SARLIN:  Heliogen is using the thermal energy it creates to make hydrogen. Ironically, most hydrogen is made using fossil fuels, which has limited its production. What Heliogen is doing is making the process of creating a clean fuel clean. GROSS:  We already moved a molecule all over the earth in the form of oil and gas. Hydrogen is also a molecule which we can transport. So why is that so important? The United States can be an energy exporter, a renewable energy exporter. SARLIN:  So are we there yet? GROSS:  We're there. This is happening. Where we really need hydrogen is for trucks, for airplanes, for long distance transportation. All the places where hydrogen is made right now in a dirty way, we're going to make it in a clean way.  SARLIN:  So the question though is if we can do it, we can do it in the lab. But can we do it on scale? GROSS:  We are doing it at scale. That's what you're looking at here. SARLIN:  At scale? GROSS:  At scale. This is a scale technology with a multi-acre field gathering the sunlight from multiple acres, concentrating it, and using that high temperature energy to split water and make hydrogen. SARLIN:  The company has major backers like Bill Gates. But still, Heliogen has faced obstacles. Your stock price has faltered over the last year. Is the business at where you want it to be? GROSS:  Absolutely. In all businesses, your timing has to be perfect. So what's happened in the last year or so that makes the timing perfect? Well, fossil fuel prices have tripled. So all of a sudden, you can go to business and say, I'm going to install a system for you that takes away the volatility, you'll have control over your own energy production and I'm going to meet or beat your price and with zero emissions.  The sun is a resource that no one owns. It gives us ten thousand times more energy than the whole humanity needs and it's available for everybody. So the innovation can happen everywhere.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. And we've got a rendezvous with the news, so let's go. We're going to begin with news on the economy regarding the most wonderful time of the year, the holiday season, traditionally a big season for shopping as well. This year, many shoppers are returning to their pre- pandemic routines, going back nearly three years now. Shoppers are expected to shop big around some key dates like Black Friday last week, but they're also predicted to make major purchases later in the shopping season, hoping to land deals.  This year, inflation has limited many shoppers budgets though. But retailer experts say that customers are pulling back on discretionary spending like furniture and electronics and are being more selective about what they buy. Many Americans are dipping into their savings accounts and racking up debt to make purchases as well. They're also utilizing services like buy now pay later, which is a type of installment loan people might use instead of a traditional credit card. Let's break it down by the numbers. Online, Black Friday sales in the United States topped a record-breaking $9 billion this year, and were over two percent higher compared to last year. U.S. shoppers spent a record $5.29 billion on Thanksgiving Day, up nearly 3 percent from a year ago.  Experts are predicting that American shoppers spent more than $9.5 billion across Saturday and Sunday, and that Monday will be the biggest online shopping day again, growing more than five percent from last year to $11 billion. But some of that growth reflects higher prices, not necessarily higher volume, due to inflation this year. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSIENESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  On this year's holiday shopping menu, more sales but with a healthy side of inflation. DENISE SALLETTE, HOLIDAY SHOPPER:  Cutting off your circulation. I'm going crazy. YURKEVICH:  Denise Sallette is in the middle of her holiday shopping at Willowbrook Mall in Wayne, New Jersey.  SALLETTE:  This is for my mom. And then I got stuff for my kids and my niece and, oh my God.  YURKEVICH:  This year, the wish list is looking a little different. Last month, inflation cooled but was still running hot at 7.7 percent year-over-  year. SALLETTE:  I've had a cutback on shopping because things are too expensive. I mean, I do have three girls. They do understand that, you know, times are hard right now and it's just me being a single mom. YURKEVICH:  Despite high inflation, the National Retail Federation estimates that nearly 8 million more people will shop between Black Friday and Cyber Monday and spend up to eight percent more this year than they did last year. MATTHEW SHAY, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL RETAIL FEDERATION:  We're looking at records in all categories. It is remarkable in the face of the cost and the price pressures that consumers are still finding a way to increase their spending power the economy, drive economic activity. YURKEVICH:  Last month, retail sales beat expectations, up 1.3 percent in October. But this month, consumer sentiment fell. Still, higher prices haven't stopped some people from shopping. Has that impacted the way you're going to spend this holiday season? CYNTHIA PENDELTON, HOLIDAY SHOPPER: For me, not really because I try not to overspend anyways. So even before this is going on, I try not to exceed what I can do.  YURKEVICH:  And according to the National Retail Federation, while online sales are expected to increase this year, a return to in-store shopping will make up a larger portion of all holiday sales. PENDELTON:  I kind of like in person more. YURKEVICH:  You do wise up. PENDELTON:  I don't know. It's just more of the feel of being able to touch it, being able to see it, being able to try it on for the stores that you allow to, and then being amongst everybody else. YURKEVICH:  It's that holiday nostalgia that Willowbrook Mall says will help this year's shopping season return to pre-pandemic expectations. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What group of islands is the most isolated population center in the world? The Galapagos, The Solomon Islands, Hawaii, or The British Isles? Answer is Hawaii. Surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the U.S. state is over 2,000 miles from California, nearly 4,000 miles from Japan. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Up next, the world's largest active volcano. The Mauna Loa in Hawaii, it's erupting for the first time in nearly years. The eruption is prompting an ash fall advisory for Hawaii's big island and surrounding waters.  The good news, there's no evacuation notice at this time. Lava flows are contained in the summit area and are not threatening to harm downslope communities according to the Hawaii Volcano Observatory.  The bad news is asphalt from the volcano could damage vehicles and buildings, contaminate water supplies, disrupt sewage and electrical systems. It could even damage or kill vegetation.  Mauna Loa has erupted 33 times since 1843 and covers half of the island of Hawaii and it's only 21 miles west of one of the most active volcanoes in the world, Kilauea, which is also currently erupting. When it erupted in 2018, it destroyed more than 700 homes. All right. From lava to dragon eggs. There's new drone technology that's improving an effective technique used to prevent wildfires, right? But it might not be what you think, not a soaring fire extinguisher or a water dropping drone. They're drones that drop fire in the form of, quote, dragon eggs to perform something called prescribed burning or starting a fire in order to avoid one later.  But some experts say that the technique is dangerous for firefighters. CNN business producer Jon Sarlin is here with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JON SARLIN, CNN BUSINESS PRODUCER:  This fireball-dropping drones are improving one of the oldest and most effective ways of preventing extreme wildfires, prescribed burning. CARRICK DETWEILER, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, DRONE AMPLIFIED:  Prescribed fires basically work by doing a very low intensity burn that will burn up the dead leaves and sticks that would cause major wildfires when they dry out later in the summer. We can reduce these huge wildfires by using more fire when it's safe to do so. SARLIN:  Many experts say prescribed burning should be used more often but it can be dangerous for firefighters.  DETWEILER:  They're often hiking out into the middle of mountains with a drip torch or they're riding an ATV and then you have helicopters with the whole crew on board flying really low and slow over the fire about a quarter of all while then firefighting fatalities are related to aviation. And for me, this really was a motivation to get these systems into the hands of firefighters. SARLIN:  Robotics researcher Carrick Detweiler started his company Drone Amplified to make prescribed fires safer, easier, and less expensive. DETWEILER:  Our system doesn't cover the amount of area that a helicopter can, but you can deploy tens or hundreds of our systems for the same cost as a helicopter. SARLIN:  On a 50-pound drone, Carrick secures a device that can carry 400 fireballs that ignite when they land on the ground.  DETWEILER:  We call these dragon eggs. They have potassium permanganate when you mix it with glycol, it starts a chemical reaction and a fire. SARLIN:  The drones allow firefighters to work at a distance from the flames and areas difficult to reach due to terrain or visibility. DETWEILER:  And this is really doubling the amount of time that firefighters can fight the fire when it's dark, when it's smoky, when other airplanes can't be out there. You can drop the balls in specific locations and this lets you do much more precise burns. SARLIN:  Precision is important, because even though prescribed burn escapes are extremely rare, the outcome can be devastating.  Two recent controlled burns in New Mexico led to the state's largest wildfire on record. DETWEILER:  Our system can help prevent escaped fires through the use of thermal cameras. You can see through smoke and look for any fires outside of the fire boundary. Our app also allows the firefighter to put in geofences to precisely control where the fire is starting and this lets the firefighters actually control the intensity of the fire. SARLIN:  Carrick says a hundred of their drone systems are now working for clients like the U.S. Forest Service and other federal agencies. But in the future, they envisioned similar systems in the back of every firefighter's truck. DETWEILER:  When firefighters are widely deploying these, we'll really be able to get up to doing more prescribed fire that's needed to mitigate these wildfires. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, we're taking a journey to the far side of the moon, and it all starts with a selfie. NASA's Orion spacecraft snapped a selfie as it approached the moon. The spacecraft was eight days into its and a half day mission at the time. The journey will go more than forty thousand miles beyond the far side of the moon and if Orion completes its journey, it'll be the farthest a spacecraft intended to carry humans has ever traveled. This selfie was snapped with a camera, on one of the capsule's solar panels. Pretty cool if I do say so myselfie.  And now on to my favorite part of the day. Special shout out to Calhoun Middle School in Denton, Texas. We see you.  Today, November 29th is Giving Tuesday. Every year on a Tuesday after Thanksgiving, people take time to give back.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, everyone? It's Wednesday. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and you are awesome. We're going to start today with a follow-up on the World Cup being played in the Middle Eastern country of Qatar. Yesterday was a huge soccer match between the USA and Iran, not just because it was a win or go home match for USA or that it was a win or draw or go home for Iran, but because of the political talking points surrounding the match. Some World Cup teams have been showing solidarity with anti-regime protesters in Iran who are fighting for women's rights. Some Iranian players even refrained from singing the national anthem ahead of their first match to show solidarity with protesters. But things really got heated when the U.S. Soccer Federation altered the Iranian flag on one of their graphics online, removing the Islamic emblem from the center of it. As a result, Iran called for FIFA, the World Cup organizers, to ban Team USA from the World Cup. That didn't happen, all this adding attention ahead of the match. Players from both sides while they do care about issues outside of sport, they really want to just focus on the game and their dream of playing in a World Cup. On Tuesday, the match finally arrived, and CNN correspondent Andy Scholes was at a watch party to take in the action. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDY SCHOLES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The party is on here in the U.S. at Fado Irish pub in Atlanta, Georgia, as Team USA is moving on. They had only scored one goal since June and that was against Wales last week, in their opening game of the World Cup. The fans here tense, waiting for the goal because they had to win the game. A tie wouldn't cut it this time around. And into the 38th minute, this place just exploded when Christian Pulisic came through with that goal to give the USA the 1-0 lead. They would hold on to win by that final score and they are now moving on to face the Netherlands. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was incredible. I thought we played the first half brilliantly. Towards the end, I was a little scared when we went defensive. But in the end, it all worked out. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So proud, so ready to the next round. I think we're going to kill it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This team is young, they're hungry, they don't 90 stop minutes strong. We got through it today. So happy, unbelievable win for the USA. Let's go baby all the way. SCHOLES:  And, Coy, as you can see this win meant so much for Team USA and their fans. And, hey, the good news is we get to do it all over again on Saturday. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. As we mentioned yesterday, the world's largest active volcano, Mauna Loa in Hawaii, has erupted for the first time in nearly years. Its neighbor, the Kilauea volcano, sits just 21 miles away and it began erupting more than a year ago. So, this rare dual eruption is expected to attract visitors from all over the world actually. Next, we're traveling to Hawaii with senior national correspondent Sara Sidner who recently flew over volcanoes in Hawaii to get a better understanding of the changing landscape and the science behind and under volcanoes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA SIDNER, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  As the sun rises each morning here in Hilo, Hawaii, it reveals destruction and creation happening simultaneously at the heart of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. I witnessed this from new heights with pilot and volcano expert Samantha Hanson. From up above, the full scale of volcanic activity is clear. SAMANTHA HANSON, PILOT:  If you look out here across the horizon, you see all these like little mini mountains out here, and these are all cinder cones. So, they're almost like many volcanoes right on the side of the big volcano. This whole thing right here that we're flying over right now, this is Mauna Loa. This is the largest volcano on the planet. SIDNER:  You really see how the lava spread out. HANSON:  Yeah. SIDNER:  I mean, it's very apparent. HANSON:  If you were to cut the island in half, it would look like Swiss cheese. It's just riddled with these lava tubes. As the island gets bigger and bigger, right, there's lava tubes, kind of, you know, build on each other. SIDNER:  But most of the volcano isn't what you see here. It's underwater where eruptions can and do occur, like the massive explosion in the waters off Tonga, just one of the over potentially active volcanoes worldwide, capable of creating earthquakes, tsunamis and entirely reshaping the landscape. One of the most devastating eruptions in Hawaii happened here in 2018 at Mount Kilauea where we joined volcanologist Kendra Lynn. KENDRA LYNN, VOLCANOLOGIST, U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY:  This was most significant collapse event that's really been recorded and observed since Western visitors arrived at the volcano. SIDNER:  Lava at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit crept across the island oozed over homes and roads and burst out of fissures. The eruption went on for over 100 days, destroying more than 700 homes and forcing thousands to evacuate. That one event dramatically changed the landscape. LYNN:  Here at the summit, almost daily, there was a magnitude earthquake as all of these rocks just started to collapse in on themselves and create the new crater. Which are kind of larger. SIDNER:  And the destruction brought a new course of exploration for Kendra, the study of rocks and how they form. LYNN:  We often looked to the rock record and the different types of rocks that are preserved around the volcano to understand past behavior. We look for patterns that might clue us into how the volcano will behave in the future. SIDNER:  Is there any prediction as to when the next eruption might be or what it's going to look like? LYNN:  It's difficult to say when, but we do know for sure that it will happen again someday. SIDNER:  Scientists are working hard to determine just how catastrophic that eruption might be. MICHAEL NEWMAN, PARK RANGER, HAWAII VOLCANOES NATIONAL PARK:  What's really remarkable about Hawaii is that it's a living landscape. It's a place where the volcano breathes. We can see the steam breathing from the crater. We can feel the movement of the earth. We can see land being created as we speak, and it's a place where we can really become in touch with nature. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these American retailers started in 1886 as a watch company? Sears, Target, Big Lots, or Costco? Considered to be the Amazon or Walmart of its day, Sears went on to become one of America's biggest retailers. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Once America's largest retailer and business employer, with an extensive retail network, Sears has struggled in the 21st century. It had more than 350,000 employees in 2006. But today, there are only 15 full-line Sears stores still open across the country and the company filed for bankruptcy years ago. We'll hear now from CNN's Rachel Crane on the slow demise of the iconic chain and how it was once both the Amazon and Walmart of its day. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RACHEL CRANE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Sears is in trouble, closing thousands of stores and losing billions of dollars. But once upon a time, Sears transformed the way Americans shopped. Back in the late 1800s in Minnesota, Richard Sears was spending his days as a railroad station agent, until one day, he sold some watches from a local jeweler and realized he was really good at selling. So, in 1886, he started a mail order company, the RW Sears Watch Company, and eventually hired a watchmaker Alva C. Roebuck. And in 1893, Sears Roebuck and Co. was born. Sears then became a very successful mail-order catalog company. This business model broke the mold. Remember, most Americans were living in small towns with access to only a few stores. They often made their own clothes and furniture or did without. Sears early catalogs only featured watches and jewelry. But soon these catalogs were more than 500 pages long, people could buy anything, from shoes, wagons, stoves and musical instruments. Sometimes, people even bought their homes directly from Sears. And because Sears bought in bulk, the company was able to charge customers lower prices. In 1925, Sears opened its first retail location in Chicago, and it wasn't just retail. Sears had a radio station, a mortgage business, a credit card. Sears was everywhere. Annual sales hit one billion dollars in 1945. The next year, sales doubled. Once Americans started to move to the booming suburbs after World War II, Sears began investing to help build malls. By 1970, Sears was considered untouchable by its rivals. But not all stories have a happy ending. As the 20th century came to a close, so did Sears' reign. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, check out this house.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Can you believe it's December 1st already? I swear it feels like it was just November yesterday. But no, just like that, only one month remaining in this year, so let's make it great. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we're starting with news out of China today, where protesters are taking to the streets in a rare display of defiance against the country's ruling communist party. The people are rising up against the zero COVID policy, a strategy that China has been using to limit the spread of COVID. But while the policy has kept China's virus levels lower than other large countries, it's placed millions of people under lockdown and quarantine, limiting their access to food medicine and family. It's also hurting the economy and restricting travel. Anger boiled over last week when a fire in an apartment building killed at least 10 people. Some believe the tragic deaths could have been prevented were it not for the anti-virus restrictions that may have prevented first responders from arriving more quickly. The authorities aren't messing around when it comes to shutting down the demonstrations and acts of defiance online as well. Hundreds of armored vehicles have been deployed to the streets. Authorities have vowed to, quote, strike hard if necessary. The number of people detained as a result of the resistance is not known at this time but the punishment for protesting in China can be severe. Senior international correspondent Ivan Watson has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  China's police state strikes back, flooding the streets of Beijing and Shanghai with police, an unmistakable show of force after a weekend of unprecedented protest in at least 15 cities across the country. In the eastern city of Hangzhou Monday night, police arrested people in a central square. And an eyewitness tells CNN police searched people's phones on the Shanghai subway, looking for apps that allow users to circumvent Shanghai's strict Internet censorship. The communist party's domestic security committee ordering officials to resolutely strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces, as well as criminal activities that destabilized social order. No compromise for peaceful protesters to voice their opinion. Meanwhile, health officials striking a slightly softer tone, calling for shorter lockdowns in the Chinese government campaign to eradicate COVID-19. CHENG YOUQUAN, CHINESE CTR. FOR DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION (through translator):  We need to minimize the inconvenience to the general public because of the anti-COVID-19 measures. As for the high-risk regions, we must have rigorous control. But at the same time, we should spare no effort to provide services to meet people's basic living needs and medical needs. WATSON:  A carrot and stick approach from different parts of the Chinese state, after the biggest nationwide display of discontent that this tightly controlled country has seen in a generation. Ivan Watson, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, we're going inside a cryptocurrency mine. Unlike the dollar, the euro, yen, franc or pound that you can put in your pocket, cryptocurrency is completely digital. It's created with encrypted computer algorithms. Many experts are quick to point out the issues with crypto, though, including market instability bankruptcies lawsuits and how it can actually harm the environment because the computers give off massive amounts of heat. That's why they're stored in crypto mines. We'll go now to northern Sweden with CNN reporter Anna Stewart who's found a mind that may be more sustainable for the environment if their plans to use the heat to grow things we can eat come to fruition. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER:  Well, this is what a crypto currency mine looks like the frozen rows of computers, in fact, there are 116,000 here. As you can hear, it sounds pretty noisy, and I can say that it feels really hot up close to these machines. There's about a 30 degrees centigrade difference though between here and here under one of the big bends where you're getting the cold air from outside. So, you can feel the energy that is coming out of these lots of power a small city, one of the reasons crypto mining can be just so controversial. But that is why Hive Blockchain Technologies have set up shops here in the north of Sweden. Come take a look why. Outside, some 500 meters along the River Lulea is a hydrogen power plant, a source of abundant cheap and renewable energy. JOHANNA THORNBLAD, PRESIDENT, HIVE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES:  This is the energy that is powering the Boden community and our data center that is located just nearby so this is also one of the main reasons that Hive has decided to bet on the Boden community. STEWART:  Given Europe is in an energy crisis, there will be people that think this is renewable energy. Should it be used for crypto mining? Shouldn't it be used to power people's homes and industry, keep lights on in hospitals? What do you say to them? THORNBLAD:  There are not enough inhabitants or companies to use all the energy that is available, so the community of Boden was inviting data centers to come to use this renewable stranded energy really. STEWART:  One crypto mining company is not just turning a profit in the midst of a crypto winter but also trying to forge a greener future, there are nearer term plans to turn the excess heat from the crypto mining into something more fruitful. THORNBLAD:  In the spring, we're going to support a Swedish company called Actira (ph). So they're building a huge, big greenhouse just at the back of our data center. And so, we will have tomatoes and cucumbers grown all year round in the very north of Sweden. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What is the geographical region at the base of South America which covers parts of Chile and Argentina? Colombia, Patagonia, Marmot, or North Face? Patagonia is your answer here, a nature lover's paradise where you could hike the Andes Mountains. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next, we head to Patagonia on the Chilean side, home to some of the most tantalizing topography and wondrous wildlife on the planet. The remote and rugged coastline region in south America is known for its gorgeous glaciers, beautiful lakes and rivers. But this region may be in danger. We'll meet Vreni Haussermann now, a marine biologist studying the wildlife in the region. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VRENI HAUSSERMANN, MARINE BIOLOGIST, SAN SEBASTIAN UNIVERSITY:  For me, Patagonia is the most beautiful part of Chile. It's a very remote, very wild and rugged coastline. Full of green forest, temperate rainforest, has lots of glaciers, rivers, lakes and the coast is very steep. The marine life came from deep waters but also from adjacent areas and so the diversity we find in fjords is elevated compared to other coastlines. My name is Vreni Haussermann. I'm a scientist working at the University of San Sebastian and I'm studying the marine biodiversity of Chilean Patagonia. Diving in Patagonia, we found many species that haven't been described before. The coastline is more than 100,000 kilometers, which is twice around the world. Only a handful of scientists working there. So even if we studied all the main areas, there are still most parts that we don't know yet. Chilean Patagonia was free of human impact for a long time, but in the '80s when aquaculture moved in, it started to be impacted. Life in the fjords has been reduced in abundance. There are species we hardly don't find anymore. By impacting an area where we know very little about, we always have the risk that we are damaging ecosystems and the equilibrium of the ecosystems is lost. I hope that humanity understands the need of protect our planet. I hope humanity understands the need of protecting the oceans and our lives and the lives of all future generations depend on a healthy ocean and a healthy planet. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, a reminder that it's never too late to right a wrong. In Minnesota, a library book was finally returned after being checked out 47 years ago. For decades, a Mercedes-Benz repair manual was missing from the shelves but earlier this month, it was mailed back with 200 bucks and an anonymous handwritten note saying that the sender had been fixing their car and although they probably couldn't afford the late fees maybe the library could buy a new book instead. Hope that dude finally got his car fixed. And you know I went to a bookstore the other day and saw a book called "How to End 50 Percent of Your Problems". So, I bought two. Shout out time now. Hanover Online School in Ashland, Virginia, thanks for subscribing typing and commenting on our YouTube channel. And thanks for all the love, @CoyWire on Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok. It is Thursday. So happy Friday eve people. My team and I are already working on a plan to finish this week strong with you right here on CNN 10. END221202

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. What a wonderful day. It's Friday and you already know Friday's rock. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, where we break down big news stories and easy to understand explanations with reporters all over the world, no opinion, no slant, just the news and we love having some fun with you. Starting with some good news today. Hurricane season is officially over in the United States. The hurricane season runs from June 1st to November 30th. And this season was notable for several reasons. One, it was calm the first half of the season. No hurricanes from July 3rd to the end of August, for the first time now since 1941. But the second half, three destructive hurricanes did hit the United States. Here's a breakdown: despite the slow start, there were 14 named storms, eight hurricanes, two of them major, registering category 3 or higher. Hurricanes Ian, Nicole and Fiona were among the most notable. Hurricane Ian made landfall as a category 4 storm, killing nearly 150 people, destroying homes and businesses. Tropical storm Ian also caused more than $50 billion in estimated damage. Several hundred Florida Keys residents marking the end of this hurricane season by gathering on Wednesday to celebrate. They burned hurricane warning flags. Some people though are still cleaning up damage left behind, mourning loved ones taken by storms. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In which of these U.S. states would you find a zip code that starts with a number 1? New York, California, Texas or Florida? Zip codes starting with a one represents New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next up, I want to introduce you to a very special principal who's empowering her students and defining her school's sense of pride. Principal Lisa Caldwell Linder from Brownsville neighborhood in Brooklyn came from what some would consider a rough neighborhood. But she always believed that she could rise above any of the negative aspects surrounding her and she did. Over time, she coined a phrase: "I am not my zip code". And she's using that phrase now to empower her students at her school and make them realize that they too can rise up higher than others might assume as possible. Meet Principal Lisa Caldwell Linder. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATHALY WARNER, FORMER ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL:  Ms. Linder sees natural abilities within people. KADIR ELLISON, FORMER STUDENT:  That's what I loved about her, that she just kept us on the right track. TRISTAN MILLS, JR., FORMER STUDENT, ASSISTANT BAND DIRECTOR:  Ms. Linder honestly gave me a safer environment. LISA CALDWELL LINDER, PRINCIPAL, PS/IS 184 NEWPORT:  My favorite phrase is "don't let the zip code fool you", because a lot of people do that. I am a product of Brownsville. My zip code growing up was 11212, and I'm sure if we Google one, one, two, one, two, all of the negatives will be exposed. I want our students to feel good regardless of their zip code. PS/IS 184 is a haven for learning. Attendance might be a challenge for a lot of our students because a violent crime may have been committed in the -- in the neighborhood, may have been committed in their complex, and there's some level of fear. Hence, that's why we try to create the safest environment internally. SUBTITLE: In order to improve attendance, Principal Linder created arts programs to encourage students to come to school. LINDER:  When I came here, I was a big advocate of the arts. Whole classes would just go to this one art teacher and no other arts offerings were made available. We instituted the following year where students were provided with an option to select which elective they would go to. So, to date, and we have the only marching band in district 23, we have added dancers to go along with the marching band. Broadway Jr. is like the creme de la creme of 184.  This year, we're doing Willy Wonka. So, you can see the difference. Students want to be present in school because we're rehearsing for Broadway Jr. We're performing for the Christmas showcase, right? So, I have to be present. So, we recognized by doing all of those things, it supported us with improving our attendance. Since the 10 years I've been here, we've seen sort of a roller coaster, I'll be honest, right? But we knew that we had to add and provide more. As a community school, we have a community resource director who identifies the gaps, what's not here. WARNER:  We are pretty much the hub of the community. Yeah, so when our parents are in need, they can come. LINDER:  How many parents are taking their children for exams? We're going to have the eye exams right here on site. WANDA SPEEDE, COMMUNITY RESOURCE DIRECTOR:  Today, as you can see, we had our food distribution of fresh produce, because we go into the supermarkets in the area, we will notice that there's a dearth of fresh natural foods. So, our book distribution, these are books that we've accumulated over the years, we've used them as class sets. We actually distribute those for free to families. So, we're excited that we can do this for the community. LINDER:  I will be retiring after 30 years with the New York City Department of Education. I felt like I had left an indelible impact on the school community and all the other communities I have worked in. AUBREY NICHOLSON, FORMER STUDENT:  Ms. Linder is an amazing person, and I would say that the school definitely, you know, started to thrive, I mean, when Ms. Linder got into the principal's office, definitely. MILLS:  Ms. Linder is like my second mother. ALIYAH BASKERVILLE, STUEDENT:  And thank you to Ms. Linder that she made that she's the main one who made this school and who made us feel powerful and brave. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. All of you powerful and brave people, your 10 out of 10 story today is about two friends from France who went to the World Cup in Qatar. Why? Because they traveled roughly 4,300 miles by bike. We're talking 13 countries, flooded woodlands in Hungary, a scorching desert in Saudi Arabia, dozens of flat tires. Their goal was to see their beloved team France, the defending World Cup champs. They told us, we're the kind of people that have big ideas and we don't want to have any regrets. Let's meet them. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MEHDI BALAMISSA, TEAM FRANCE FAN:  This crazy idea of going to Qatar from Paris by bicycle to attend the World Cup. GABRIEL MARTIN, TEAM FRANCE FAN:  It was under 7,000 kilometers, three months, 13 countries. We went from Paris to Istanbul. Istanbul, we went south was Jerusalem. Third of our adventure, weather in Saudi Arabia. BALAMISSA:  And we actually went through all kinds of landscapes, from Europe to the mountains of Turkey, and in the desert in the Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia. First stages in the desert were especially very hard because it's a very -- like it's such a hostile environment. And compared to what we experienced in Europe for example, there is just nothing around here. MARTIN:  We had a lot of surprises, but I think the most important but how hospitality is a world, a universal world. You know, in each country, we are received by people, giving us some food, even giving us some water, sometimes welcoming us at home. Arriving in Doha was incredible. There were so many people welcoming us especially from the French community based in Doha. We had the French national team here. They made the surprise to work on us, to take picture with us, and to offer the French national jersey with all the players signatures. BALAMSSIA:  So, we will fly back to Paris, but this doesn't mean bike trips are over the lifestyle that we actually loved, and I'm sure that we will want to go back on other adventures. We were actually very happy to document our trip and share with our followers on social media. And so, we also realized that this was a way of telling people that, look, you can take your bike and live adventures. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, lovely people. We made it. There ain't no mentum like momentum. So, let's finish this week strong and power right along into the weekend. First, though, a shout out to Lakeview Junior and Senior High School in Campti, Louisiana. Remember, you are more powerful than you know. I'm Coy. This is CNN, and it's been a blessing to spend this week with you. END221205

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. It's your boy Coy here, starting with some Monday motivation for you and me.  I challenge you to say the alphabet backwards -- Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T, S, R, Q, P, O, N, M, L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, G, A. Like that. And I want you to challenge me to work a unique word of your choice into tomorrow's show. Follow me @CoyWire on Insta, Snapchat and TikTok and put your challenge words in a comment, and I'll choose one fun one to work in tomorrow's show. All right. It's time for the best 10 minutes in news for you. CNN starts right now. We're going to start with the news out of Hawaii. On Sunday, huge amounts of lava continue to flow from the Mauna Loa volcano, the world's largest active volcano, which has been erupting for over a week now. It turns out the lava is creeping closer to a key highway that connects the east and west sides of the big islands of Hawaii. As of Saturday morning, the lava was just two and a half miles from the DKI highway. It had been moving around feet per hour over the last hours.  For now, the highway remains open and it's even attracted sightseers who have flocked the area to see the historic lava show. The volcano is erupting for the first time in almost four decades. The flow of lava is unpredictable. Its direction is expected to change hour to hour and day to day, making it difficult to estimate when or even if the lava flow will impact the highway.  In the meantime, Hawaiian officials say they have a plan to shut the highway down if the lava gets close enough to become dangerous. Now, while it may seem scary and potentially destructive, some people see it as beautiful. After all, the islands were formed as a result of volcanic eruptions. So without lava flow, there would be no Hawaii at all. CNN's David Culver is on the scene with the latest.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The nighttime glow of Mauna Loa's oozing lava -- well, you just have to pull over and properly admire it.  It's basically the middle the night and you guys are out here, why?  PIILANI ZYCH, OAHU, HAWAII RESIDENT:  Well, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to be able to experience this. And we decided to come early in the morning so we didn't have to sit in traffic.  CULVER:  Having hopped from Oahu to here, the big island, this family, three generations, came to respectfully honor the Hawaiian eruptions.  ZYCH:  It's all beautiful to us. So, we pay huge reverence to this. It's very culturally significant for us as well. So, it's a big deal.  CULVER:  A site made even more luring with the side of sunrise, which brought the crowds to old saddle road. Officials turning this stretch into a one-way street, allowing passersby the chance to stop and let the views seep in.  And that keeps drivers from pulling over and stopping on this, what is one of the main highways connecting one part of the island to the other. USGS and state officials warned, the lava flow, while slowed in recent days, is inching closer to cutting off this highway. It is within three miles now.  The other worry, not here on the ground but up in the air. What looks like plumes of smoke, experts say those are acid gases. Officials monitoring the levels, warning it could become tax toxic for residents and visitors of the big island.  Mauna Loa is the second of the big islands five volcanoes currently erupting. Kilauea is still rumbling after destroying more than 600 homes here in 2018.  But many Hawaiians see the potential path of destruction as simultaneous creation, surfacing from this, the world's largest active volcano.  And with the eruption continuing at its current pacing, officials feel like they should be able to give folks up to two days notice should the lava make its way onto that major thoroughfare cutting off that highway. But they also warn when it comes to the flow of lava, there is no forecasting. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Who conducted the first spacewalk, which took place in 1965? Alan Shepard, Yuri Gagarin, Ed White, or Alexei Leonov? While Ed White was the first American to space walk, the first to ever do it was Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  On Saturday, the International Space Station got powered up. NASA astronauts Josh Casada and Frank Rubio got suited up and floated outside the station to install a solar array or panel on the outside of the space lab. Their mission lasted seven hours. There were two solar arrays installed back in June of 2021, but now, the plan is to add a total of six more to hopefully boost the space station's power generation by more than 30 percent. The original solar arrays were only designed to last 15 years, but they've been supplying power for more than 20 years. They still work but they're definitely showing some signs of wear and tear after that long-term exposure to the environment.  When it comes to office views though, this one might be the best one in the world or the best out of this world. (MUSIC) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, a fresh look at a game of golf on the moon. Astronaut Alan Shepard will forever be remembered for becoming the first American in space in 1961. Putt in 1971, as commander of the Apollo 14 moon mission, he left viewers and even folks back at mission control stunned when he pulled out a club and ball to take a celestial swing on a fairway 230 miles away.  His moon game is now being seen in a whole new light after a NASA specialist dedicated over 10,000 hours to restoring flight film of the Apollo missions. Now here's teeing up for us right now. Roll it. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUBTITLE:  Over 50 years ago, Alan B. Shepard Jr. played a game of golf that was "out of this world".  Almost 240,000 miles away from Earth, Shepard hit two golf balls on the surface of the moon. Despite being so far away, he found a way to connect with the people back home. BRIAN ODOM, CHIEF HISTORIAN AT NASA:  I think it resonates with people because it's just a very human activity, a very, you know, a cultural thing that's taking place on the moon. So I think that's why it really resonates with folks. You can talk seismometers and all of this stuff all day long really of what they're doing on the moon, but you talk hitting a golf ball in the moon and people like, oh, yeah, right. Shepard obviously was the first American in space and he'd been grounded for a long time. So, you know, he thought he may never get to go back into space. So when he finally gets this, you know, his health works out and he gets this opportunity to go back, you can kind of see him thinking what's something fun and cool I can do to put my own stamp on this program. And, you know, sneaking things onto the capsule and hitting a golf ball, that seems to be pretty well in line with the Shepard we know. SUBTITLE:  Former property developer Andy Saunders found a new calling in enhancing poor quality NASA archive footage.  It was the lack of high-quality pictures of Neil Armstrong on the moon that started him on this path.  ANDY SAUNDERS, NASA DIGITAL RESTORATION EXPERT:  I wanted to see Neil Armstrong in the moon, he first person on another world, this monumental moment in history. Since childhood, I was obsessed with anything that could fly really from boomerangs and paper airplanes. Rockets were the ultimate, and it was also that added fascination with the moon. At one stage, I was kind of a semi-professional photographer, probably is about as serious as I got. And it's kind of uniting those two things, those two interests that led me to take on this, this particular project. SUBTITLE:  Like Armstrong, there was limited coverage of Shepard's feat, and it was Saunders' job to change that.  SAUNDERS:  They had TV footage of him swinging the club, live TV footage that was being back very, very, very low quality. But you couldn't see them and the ball disappeared off screen.  In the low res images, everything just looks like small rocks. But in a higher resolution scan, I could zoom right in, enhance it and find something which looked very much like a ball. SUBTITLE:  In February 2021, Saunders found the second golf ball and was able to accurately measure the distance traveled: 40 yards.  SAUNDERS:  When he said, oh, it's gone miles and miles and miles, I think he knew deep down that they didn't quite go that far. So 40 hours, that's terrible, but you know, they have these visors, they built your spacesuit. They could barely even see their feet. So visibility wasn't very good because of the restrictive suit, he had to hit it one-handed.  So to even make contact I think was pretty, pretty impressive. SUBTITLE:  Why do Shepard's actions resonate so much? ODOM:  It's the human side of this. It's, you know, that's the thing we can't forget. When it comes to a human activity, something that's done just for the joy of being alive, that's something that people can appreciate. SAUNDERS:  You know, a lot of people know that someone play golf on the moon but not a lot of those people would know that it was on Apollo 14. That there was even wasn't Apollo 14. So, you know, those human moments resonate forever, and that -- and that's one of the few. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  That's all we have time for, for now. We hope that that story helped to capture your i-moon-gination in this marvelous Monday.  Our shout-out today goes to a school of innovation. The Franklin School of Innovation in Asheville, North Carolina.  Our goal is to shout out all of your schools lunar than later. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire and this is CNN 10. END221206

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. As the ancient philosopher Confucius once said, we have two lives and the second begins when we realize we only have one. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. With just 86,400 seconds in this day, let's get going and let's make the most of them. We're going to begin with the latest out of Indonesia where Mount Semeru, a very active volcano, erupted on Sunday, blanketing roads and homes in volcanic ash and promoting evacuations of nearly 2,000 residents in the East Java province. The volcano spewed thick columns of ash, nearly 5,000 feet into the sky and as far as 7.4 miles away. Villages and nearby towns blanketed with falling ash, blocking out the sun but thankfully no casualties have been reported. On Monday, improved weather conditions allowed rescuers to resume evacuation efforts in a search for possible victims. The area of eruption is the most densely populated island in Indonesia, nearly 2,000 people escaped to emergency shelters at several schools. Indonesia's officials warned residents to stay at least miles away from the volcano's eruption center. But many felt they had to return to their homes Monday to protect their property. The eruption in East Java on Sunday following a series of earthquakes on the west of the island, including one last month that killed more than 300 people, and many residents are still traumatized after more than 50 people were killed, and thousands more displaced when the same volcano erupted just last year. We'll continue to follow this story as well as the Mauna Loa volcano eruption in Hawaii. Let's hear more now from my friend, CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice-over):  Ash fills the skies in Indonesia, forming a thick caustic cloud over Mount Semeru on the island of Java. Video from the country's ministry of environment and forestry captured the explosive eruption on Saturday a burst of ash shooting 15 kilometers into the sky, a sign for people living in the volcano's shadow it's time to go. This man, escaping on a motorbike, the ash caking on his face. He says he doesn't know where he's going just somewhere out of the volcano's reach. Authorities say nearly 2,000 people have been evacuated from the slopes of the volcano which is located about kilometers southeast of Jakarta. The roads in the area are packed with vehicles rushing to outrun the volcanic ash that is still raining down. Emergency workers are directing people out of the danger zone, handing out masks and urging them to go to shelters. INDAH AMPERAWATI MASDAR, LUMAJANG DISTRICT DEPUTY CHIEF (through translator):  We have readied some nearby schools and village halls. We will prepare them until the observatory post declares it's safe. CHINCHAR:  The damage has already been done to some areas. Rooftops are singed and the ground is covered with smoldering soot. Authorities are telling people to stay at least eight kilometers away from the eruption center, but there are fears the hot ash could drift further. So far, many people are heeding the warnings, a lesson learned last year when more than people were killed in a previous eruption and thousands were forced from their homes. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which U.S. state nickname was inspired by the sticky sap of its pine trees? California, Montana, North Carolina, or Alaska? With vast pine tree forests, North Carolina is nicknamed the Tar Heel State. Power outages in North Carolina are causing so much concern that the FBI is investigating. Officials believe intentional attacks on substations are causing power outages in Moore County near Fayetteville. But at this time, they haven't named any suspects or even motives. Forty thousand customers were in the dark as of Sunday. The investigation turned into a criminal investigation when utility crews found signs of potential vandalism to equipment at several different sites, including two substations that were damaged by gunfire. We're talking millions of dollars in estimated damage. In order to protect residents, property, businesses and public services, the authorities announced a mandatory curfew from 9:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m. in the county. The curfew which started Sunday will continue nightly until there's an emergency declaration. This outage is impacting the community in all sorts of ways as you can imagine. All schools in the county were closed on Monday. There was no church on Sunday. Traffic lights are out. Many businesses are closed, with a few stores using generators to open their doors. Authorities opened a shelter which is running on a generator. According to local officials, the damage is significant and rerouting power just isn't an option. As of Monday, an FBI manhunt was underway. But whoever is responsible remains a mystery to the community. We'll keep you updated in the coming days right here on CNN 10. Next up, CNN business producer Jon Sarlin is introducing us to BlocPower, one of a handful of companies looking to make clean energy affordable for everyone. The Brooklyn, New York-based business wants to help companies prioritize helping the climate, while also lowering utility bills and saving money. The company also targets dense and low-income neighborhoods where significant cost savings can help the most. They've reached nearly 1,200 buildings in New York so far. Let's learn more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JON SARLIN, CNN BUSINESS PRODUCER:  From eating locally to buying an electric car, being eco-friendly can be expensive especially when it comes to making our homes greener. In 2020, residential and commercial buildings accounted for 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. But the cost of buying and installing green technology can cost tens of thousands of dollars. DONNEL BAIRD, CEO, BLOCPOWER:  Greening buildings can be really difficult, complicated and hard and a little scary and expensive. SARLIN:  But what if it wasn't expensive, and you could make your building green without paying any upfront costs. A company called BlocPower is one of a handful of companies trying to make that possible. BAIRD:  Our job is, okay, how do we make clean energy affordable for everyone? A lot of building owners and property managers might not care about climate change as their top priority, but they definitely care about reducing their costs because that's money that can go in their pocket. SARLIN:  BlocPower leases and installs equipment like solar panels and heat pumps, energy efficient devices that both heat and cool buildings and use about 50 percent less energy than furnaces or baseboard heaters, all of which means lower bills. According to BlocPower, installing a heat pump can lower utility bills between 20 and 70 percent a year, the company is able to make back its money over time by taking a portion of the building's savings. LINCOLN ECCLES, BUILDING OWNER:  It looks very clean and very sleek. I like I like how you guys did this. This system it's quiet, it's clean. I've literally had tenants come up to me and tell me that they see a real savings in their actual electricity use. NOAH, BROOKLYN RESIDENT:  Right, so that we had a radiator system, the radiator was either just hot, extremely hot or non-existent, so my bill has significantly been a lot cheaper. SARLIN:  Greening buildings has become more competitive with companies like Sealed also offering retrofits with no upfront costs. BlocPower says it prioritizes greening dense, low and moderate-income neighborhoods where buildings are often outdated, and cost savings are needed most. BAIRD:  I grew up in a low-income apartment building. All the buildings were overheated. The tenants had opened up all the windows and we're burning energy that was like floating out of the window. And so, I was like man, there's a massive problem here. SARLIN:  Since 2004, Brooklyn-based BlocPower has upgraded over 1,200 buildings in New York, and they're partnering with cities around the country to help them hit carbon goals. With investment from the Bezos Earth Fund, they're currently building proprietary software that they say will help them identify greening opportunities for millions of buildings. BAIRD:  The most rewarding part of working at BlocPower for me is I'll be able to look my kids in the eye and say I did everything I could to prevent the climate disaster. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10, an Illinois 8th grade hooper hitting legendary status with an epic buzzer beater. Milton Pope down just one with just seconds to go and the opponent misses a free throw, but Cooper Thorson snags the rebound dribbles around, he heaves it, and you better believe it. Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Cooper hitting the nearly full court shot but dropping it like it's hot. The whole moment was caught on camera, creating the perfect viral moment. CNN highlight reel. Take that chef Steph Curry, this is Cooper's kitchen. And that kid is eaten. And now on to our favorite part of the day, I want to give a special shout out to Foxboro High School in Foxboro, Massachusetts. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one, going out and make someone smile today. Remember that kindness is not what you do, but who you are.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. I'm Coy Wire, ready to make this a wonderful Wednesday with you. But before, I start I must say I am bumfuzzled by the amount of creativity and passion with which you accepted my challenge to pick a word for me to work into yesterday's show. It was supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, if you didn't notice. And don't worry, I'll challenge you to another one next week. We start today with the latest on the economy. If you've watched the news in the last few months, it's likely you've seen concerns from consumers and experts about the economy or headlines featuring layoffs especially in the tech industry. However, this month, the economy showed a continued demand for workers, and new jobs were added to the market. This is despite the Federal Reserve's push to curb inflation which was predicted to impact the economy and the job market. Let's break it down by the numbers. Employers added 263,000 jobs this month. That's only a slight drop from 284,000 added in October and the unemployment rate was unchanged this month at 3.7 percent. We'll bring you now to Christine Romans, CNN chief business correspondent and anchor of "EARLY START" who will tell us more about the state of the economy and consumer concerns. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Behind all those headlines of tech layoffs, sour consumer confidence, inflation anxiety, it's an economy showing resilience. Surprising strength in the economy in the third quarter, 2.9 percent annual growth from July through September, a sharp bounce back from a contraction in the first half of the year -- you know, it's a pace that would have been considered very strong before the pandemic.  The job market remains strong, too. Another 263,000 jobs added in November. It's the fewest in months but it's more than economist forecast.  This year, a stunning 4.2 million jobs added. Stripping out the pandemic, it's the most jobs added in years. And inflation, while still too hot, is showing signs of cooling.  The fed's favorite inflation gauge, the PCE price index showing signs of peaking, and gas prices are falling. They're below where they were when Russia invaded Ukraine.  Call it the yes-but economy. Yes, consumers feel like the economy is bad, but they keep spending. After all, it was a record Thanksgiving shopping season. So, why the foul mood and the sometimes conflicting headlines?  Well, COVID broke the economy and putting it back together has been hard to measure. Remember tens of millions of jobs were lost overnight, schools closed, factories shuttered, more than a million lives lost. More than two years later, we're still struggling to gauge the strength and durability of the recovery. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia, which of these animals is part of the Canidae family? Grizzly bear, golden retriever, gopher, or goldfish? Often referred to as canines, dogs, including golden retrievers, are part of the Canidae family. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Up next, we're introducing you to a very special organization called Canine Companions. They're the oldest and largest organization in the U.S. that provides service dogs. They provide service dogs for children and adults with a wide range of needs, including both physical and emotional support. These pups are uplifting and they're pretty doggone cute, too. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELINDA SOWERS, VP, CANINE TRAINING AND CLIENT SERVICES, CANINE COMPANIES:  We're in Orlando, Florida. We are at the southeast region campus of Canine Companions. We are the largest and oldest organization that provides service dogs for children, adults and veterans with disabilities. And we work really hard to transform lives. At Canine Companions, we offer several different types of dogs. One of the types of dogs that we offer is a service dog. The service dog works with someone to mitigate their disability. They can pick up items, open and close doors, drawers, refrigerators. The dogs can know over 40 commands. We want the dogs to love the work they do. SUBTITLE:  Canine Companions places dogs who can help with more disabilities, PTSD, emotional support and physical therapy. SOWERS:  Since 1975, we've placed over dogs. We currently have over 2,600 graduates that are out there working with service dogs to our organization, and over 1,400 puppy raisers who are raising puppies for us. SUBTITLE: Dogs are trained from puppyhood for over two years before being placed with people in need. The service animals are matched with their new recipients during a process called "team training".  SOWERS:  Team training is just a magical time.  It's for so many of them, the moment that they have been waiting for.  IZZY & ALANA SHERMAN, CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA:  So, we applied I want to say a year and a half ago. We just knew that this was the right thing because as he's been in and out of hospitals because of brain cancer, and all the facilities we've been in have therapy dogs and they just bring so much joy to the kids. The ability to give her not only a companion but a skilled companion that can help with some of the challenges that we face daily. SUBTITLE:  Canine Companions breeds Labrador and golden retrievers for their temperament and work ethic.  SOWERS:  We provide all of our dogs free of charge just thanks to amazing donations.  SHERMAN:  I mean our medical bills are quite high. So it's really a gift to our family. SOWERS:  We want to make sure that anybody who needs a service dog or a facility dog is able to get one. SUBTITLE:  To increase their supply of service dogs, Canine Companions partners with Duke University's "Puppy Kindergarten," a program designed to identify strong service dog candidates.  Aurora attended Duke Puppy Kindergarten before finishing her training at Canine Companions.  SOWERS:  And then at the end of that team training class, they'll have a graduation ceremony where they will graduate and go home. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Today is Canine Companions national graduation day. Instead of a diploma, our graduates today will be handed a leash. SHERMAN:  You know, it isn't the unknown. And the unknown brings questions. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Congratulations. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, we're going to meet a voice that might be familiar to you if you've ever been on TikTok. I was pretty blown away actually when I found out this voice was actually a person and not a computer.  Let's meet Kat Callaghan, the real life woman behind TikTok's text to speech feature and one of the most popular influencers online. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAT CALLAGHAN, VOICE OVER ARTIST:  Songs that made artists famous.  If you have an air fryer, you need to try this. Would you sit in this seat? My name is Kat. I work with TikTok on TTS and other projects. You're probably sick of my voice. I am sick of my voice. SUBTITLE:  Kat Callaghan, the voice behind TikTok's "Jessie" text-to-speech feature, recently revealed herself on her TikTok account. CALLAGHAN:  I understand people are a little bit freaked out that have never heard my voice before in association with a human being. I've had interviews for the last several weeks with people going, okay, I can't -- I can't look at you, because I think you should say, I can't look at you when you're talking. And you don't hear it in my regular voice all the time but once I hit that upper inflection, you know you can hear it. SUBTITLE:  Callaghan, a radio host in Canada, is still getting used to the fact that her voice is TikTok famous.  CALLAGHAN:  People are recognizing me as the voice of TikTok, and also as a radio person. I was walking down the street and a car stopped and said, "Voice of Kat", which is my which is my TikTok handle is "Voice of Kat". And I'm just like, oh, yes, hello. SUBTITLE:  However, reactions from the revelation haven't been entirely positive, with users mocking Jessie's text-to-speech feature limitations.  CALLAGHAN:  The way I say law. Definitely not a perfect technology. I'd like to have fun with the fact though that Jesse mispronounces words.  Why do you say emoji like emoji? It's one of the funniest things to be honest with you is people commenting, say this, say that, or why do you pronounce it this way? So I plan to just continue to have a little bit of fun with that. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. We are so grateful to spend part of our day with you. To get your shout out, remember to subscribe to our YouTube Channel CNN 10, and leave a comment with your school, name, city, state and mascot, and the pronunciation if necessary. Chandler Academy in Charleston, West Virginia, thank you for showing the love. We're showing it right back at you. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire and this is CNN 10. END221208

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. It's Thursday. So happy Friday eve. It's your boy Coy, Mr. Clean, but I keep it cleaner. Let's keep crushing it this week each day aiming to be a little better than the day before. This is CNN and it's time to fuel our minds. We start with an update. China is scrapping some of its most controversial COVID rules, moving away from their strict zero COVID policy which have caused people mental and emotional stress and strain. Earlier this month, protesters took to the streets in a rare display of defiance against the country's ruling communist party. The people are reeling from the effects of the government placing millions of people under lockdown and limiting access to loved ones, food and even medicine. All this on top of the economic strain it's caused. China's zero COVID policy has kept the nation's infection rate lower than countries like the United States by isolating every case of COVID and shutting down the surrounding areas. But easing restrictions now marks a significant step in the government's plans to reopen the country. This week, the Chinese government announced 10 new guidelines that loosened restrictions, most notably allowing people with COVID to quarantine at home instead of being taken to an isolation facility, a practice which previously frightened its citizens. The government is also dropping mandates that required proof of a negative COVID test to enter public places. These are some of the significant steps which should offer relief to China's residents after nearly three years of disruption to their daily lives and economic futures. But there's still concern. Twenty-five million people in China have not received a coronavirus vaccine. If there's an influx of new cases, it could overwhelm the hospital system, leading to a potentially tragic situation for citizens. Our Selina Wang has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  This is the kind of line Beijingers stand in, outside in the cold to get their COVID tests. A 48-  hour test is required to get into most places. But there aren't many places to go. Much of Beijing is still closed down. This is one of the most popular tourist places in the city. But the restaurants are largely closed, and the malls are pretty empty. So, this McDonald's is still open but for takeaway only. But even to get takeaway, you've got to prove that you're clear of COVID. Here's how I do it. I open up the health app on my smartphone, I scan the QR code. So, it says, I've got a green code, and I've got a recent COVID test, so I'm good to go. This code dictates all of our daily lives in China. Green means good to go. Red means I may have to isolate at home or go to a mass quarantine facility. This allows China to track the movements of virtually all 1.4 billion people in the name of contact tracing. I've got to scan my code to get into a taxi, a public park, a mall, or a coffee shop. Even a public bathroom. (voice-over):  I ran into a group of delivery people on the street. They've got to do COVID tests every single day to do their jobs. This woman tells me the pandemic has been hard on her. I ask her why. She says it's because she's scared of the virus. Getting COVID in China is unlike anywhere else in the world. You and your close contacts all get sent to a quarantine center. This is a convention center in Beijing that's been turned into a massive quarantine facility with thousands of beds. But some of these facilities in the country, they are in very run-down and unsanitary condition. And then your whole building or community could go into lockdown. I spoke to a man who's been in and out of quarantine six times already just this year. He tells me his whole building of more than 200 families went to a quarantine facility last month, because they were considered close contacts. He says he's not scared to get COVID because omicron is less severe and his whole family has been vaccinated. I approached a few people just released from this mass quarantine center here. I ask if they had tested positive for COVID. Yes, the man nods and says they have recovered. "How many days did you spend in there?" I asked. "Seven days," he said. Unprecedented protests recently erupted across China. They are chanting that they don't want COVID tests, they want freedom. Authorities swiftly cracked down on the protesters. But they are finally softening their stance on zero COVID. Some cities are lifting lockdowns, changing COVID testing requirements. Under some conditions, people can now quarantine at home if they have COVID, which is a huge deal. But this country has already built up a whole infrastructure around zero COVID, spending all of its resources on quarantine facilities and COVID testing. So it's going to be a long and slow exit from zero COVID. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In the animal kingdom, oysters are classified under what phylum? Mollusca, arthropoda, chordata or porifera? Oysters are soft-bodied invertebrates belonging to the phylum mollusca. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Did you know that scientists estimate that oysters have been around for 15 million years and they're far more valuable than the beautiful pearls that they can produce. The reefs that take shape as they grow together create a shelter where hundreds of other species can flourish. They're also crucial for ocean health, filtering the water around them. One oyster can filter gallons of water per day. Let's hear now from conservationists who are hoping to be successful in restoring Hong Kong's famous oyster reefs in CNN's Call to Earth. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Tucked away in the northwest corner of Hong Kong with the high-tech Chinese mega city of Shenzhen in sight is a rich habitat that is home to mangroves, soft, muddy shores and oyster reefs that date back centuries. For over 700 years local farmers cultivated oysters here in the mud flats of Pak Nai and recent decades, traditional oyster farming has declined due in part to coastal reclamation and over harvesting. But conservationists like Marine Thomas have discovered that reintroducing oysters to the abandoned reefs can boost biodiversity and strengthen these shores. MARINE THOMAS, SENIOR CONSERVATION PROGRAM MANAGER, THE NATURE CONSERVANCY:  Usually, people will associate oysters with food but less known is that oysters and other shellfish create habitats. They create reef habitats. In fact, just like coral reefs, they will bunch together and create these hard structures that you can actually walk on. STOUT:  In a survey of the city's coastlines, researchers from the Nature Conservancy at the University of Hong Kong discovered existing reefs like these old farms could potentially act as a source of oyster larvae. They also found that a single Hong Kong oyster can filter up to 30 liters or 8 gallons of water an hour, one of the highest filtration rates recorded for the species. Another finding, the reefs host six times more species and bare mud flats as the piles of shells provide shelter for worms and small crabs, attracting a variety of animals including birds like this little egret. And yet another benefit is mitigating the effects of climate change, so how does the humble oyster do that? THOMAS:  So the humble oyster will also help us fight climate change if it's in a reef structure so if it's in a hard reef structure that is creating a barrier, think of it as a natural sea wall then it's going to be creating friction on the sea bottom that will attenuate wave action and therefore also flooding at the back of it. STOUT:  Since 2020, Thomas and a team of volunteers have been at work restoring this abandoned oyster farm. They dry old shells in the sun before returning them to the water to form a base for oyster larva to attach to. They hope to introduce millions of oysters to help revitalize the area over the next few years. ASHLEY HEMRAJ, MARINE BIOLOGIST, THE SWIRE INSTITUTE OF MARINE SCIENCE, THE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG:  One of the biggest things that always amazes me and makes me happy is seeing all the number of crabs here, especially here as you walk, the crab walks away. It's -- if you fix on it, it's quite amazing to see this. It is really, really beautiful. STOUT:  As new oysters grow, they clean the water, provide shelter and food for wildlife and join forces with the mangroves as a coastal buffer. A spectacular sunset descends on Pak Nai as these small briny creatures work to build an ever more vibrant ecosystem. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, if you're a jogger and you're claustrophobic, this race is not for you. Hundreds of jolly old joggers in a Santa run in Michendorf, Germany, jingling all the way, dressed in red from head to mistletoe, look at all those Santas go. Talk about spreading Christmas cheer, this is the 14th annual race. One Santa said that even if you finish last, it's being there that counts. They ran in near freezing temperatures, maybe getting fit to deliver those gifts, Santa even without his sleigh still slays. It's slay-NN 10, the most wonderful time of the year and the most wonderful part of this show: you. Special shout out to all the teachers today. Keep up lifting, informing and inspiring students. Going up and dap your teacher up give them a handshake or a high five. Let them know that you appreciate them. Also getting a shout out, Holdrege Middle School in Holdrege, Nebraska. Keep shining. I'm Coy Wire. I'm headed to Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love. So I'll see you from there tomorrow. END221209

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people, and welcome to the city of Brotherly Love, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, my home state. I'm standing in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and you may recognize those steps, the iconic rocky steps. We're here for one of the greatest rivalries in all of sports. Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. Eastern, it's the 123rd edition of the Army-Navy football game and it's so much more than a game. Dating back to 1890, the traditions, pageantry, passion and respect make the Army-Navy game the greatest rivalry in American sports. The game is so big, 10 sitting U.S. presidents have attended, from Theodore Roosevelt in 1901, to Donald Trump two years ago. It is humbling to watch this rivalry. It's said that this is a game where everyone playing is willing to die for everyone watching. That's powerful stuff. This is America's game. If only all of us could have the perspective of these individuals representing the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York. They stand their ground against the opposing side, but afterwards, they walk across the field and embrace each other as brothers and sisters because they never forget that in the end, they're all on the same team. But don't get me wrong they play hard for bragging rights that'll last a lifetime. Navy leads the series 62-53-7 all time and to paraphrase the 34th president of the United States Dwight Eisenhower, the Army and Navy are the best of friends 364-1/2 days out of the year. But on this one Saturday afternoon, they are the worst of enemies. The rivalry is also loaded with traditions, like when Army West Point's marathon team runs the ball about 150 miles through the night and through the elements, from West Point to Philly. There's also a flyover before the game during the national anthem, and there isn't a dry eye in the stadium. Later on in the show, I'll tell you about some of the fun pranks associated with the rivalry. But first let's take a look at some of the headlines of today. WNBA star Brittney Griner was released from a Russian prison yesterday. In February, she was arrested on drug smuggling charges when traveling through the Moscow airport. In August, she was sentenced to nine years in a Russian prison. Griner's release on Thursday was part of a prisoner swap between Russia and the United States. A convicted Russian arms dealer Victor Bout was released from a U.S. prison. He was previously sentenced to 25 years on charges of conspiring to kill Americans and providing weapons to terrorist organizations. The swap did not include another American that the state department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whalen. Here's what President Biden had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We never forgot about Brittney. We've not forgotten about Paul Whelan who's been unjustly detained in Russia for years. This was not a choice of which American to bring home. We brought home Trevor Reed when we had a chance early this year. Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul's case differently than Brittney's. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul's release, we are not giving up. We will never give up. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next up, scientists say they have now confirmed why we get more colds in the wintertime, and they say it's a major breakthrough. According to a recent study, it turns out that the cold air damages the immune response occurring in our noses. When we're exposed to cold air the temperature in our nose can drop by as much as 9 degrees Fahrenheit and that kills nearly percent of the billions of virus and bacteria fighting cells in our nostrils. It's enough to essentially knock out all of the immune advantages that our nose has to offer. More research is needed to understand how this research could be used to prevent illness in the future. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these prehistoric animals was a marine reptile? Allosaurus, Plesiosaur, Diplodocus or ankylosaurus? While the others on this list were all land dinosaurs, the plesiosaur was a marine reptile and an intact skeleton of one was just discovered in Australia. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUBTITLE:  This 100-million-year-old intact plesiosaur skeleton was discovered in Queensland, Australia. Amateur paleontologists known as the "Rock Chicks" uncovered the remains of the 19-foot-tall reptile in August. Researchers say the finding may provide vital clues about prehistoric life. DR. ESPEN KNUTSEN, SENIOR CURATOR OF PALEONTOLOGY, QUEENSLAND MUSEUM:  So, usually, what we find is that when we're digging these things out of the ground is that we'll find bits of the body, no head, and very, very rarely, we'll find just ahead, but unfortunately with no body attached. So the fact that this guy had both allows us to close that gap where they have this overlap between the body and the head that will unravel a lot of the species diversity, of how many species of these long neck pieces also swimming around here in this outback ocean 100 million years ago. SUBTITLE:  Plesiosaurs are not classified as dinosaurs as they did not have gills and had to surface to breathe. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Okay. Now to those pranks I was telling you about. As I mentioned at the top of the show, there's so much tradition associated with the Army-  Navy game but some of it is all in good fun. Exhibit A, this year, Navy flew over the Army's campus and dropped a bunch of ping pong balls that said, go Navy, beat Army. But every year, the Navy has to protect their beloved mascots, their goats, because the Army tries to steal them. A while back I got to interview the goats and their protectors. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Preparations for the Army-Navy game can be intense. You have the game plan, the playbooks and the practices. But perhaps one of the most important facets of pre-game preparations here in Annapolis has nothing to do with the players, but rather mascots, goats, and more specifically protecting the goats. Can you tell us where you keep the goats? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I can't tell you that.. WIRE:  We won't tell anyone. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, afraid I can't do that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We don't want Army to come and steal it, like we know they're not capable of doing it, but just for a precaution measures. WIRE:  So, we're talking maybe confidential, secret or the location of the goats. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Above top secret. So, we're -- this is a whole separate classification. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They're kept at a pretty secure location though. They have a guard dog. WIRE:  So, there is a guard dog? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There is, and he is massive and scary. WIRE:  You think if I ask a goat, maybe they would tell me where they're kept. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You could definitely try but they've been briefed heavily, and let's just say they probably won't give you anything either. WIRE:  Can you tell us where your hideout is? Are you aware of the Army's hype video that they released? It alludes to an elaborate plot to steal the goats this year. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Confirm the role of Billy the Goat is the head of Navy spirit group. WIRE:  Does it make you nervous? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It does not. I've seen our security measures and especially the dog once again is I don't think anyone could get past him. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We feel the goods are pretty secure, and not many people know their location, and even if they did, they'd have a hard time stealing them. UNIDENTIFIED MALES:  Fear the goats, beat the Army. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. For today's 10 out of 10, the Oxford Dictionary just announced their word of the year. Drum roll, please. It's -- wait, what? The word is goblin mode, technically two words. It's a slang term that became popular during the pandemic, and it means someone that is unapologetically self-indulgent and loves being lazy. This way of life rejects all social expectations. Yeah. I know, we're not talking about anyone in this group, right? Yeah, sure. All right. We are going to switch from goblin mode to beast mode. All right, being that we're at one of the most popular tourist destinations in all of Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, you know I had to take you on a run with me up the iconic Rocky steps from the 1976 film "Rocky". Thousands of people flock to these steps every year to mimic one of the most famous movie scenes in the world. Rocky Balboa finishing a morning run at the top of these steps, a symbol for all the underdogs out there. Now, we're going to give a special shout out to New Hope Middle School in Columbus, Mississippi. Rise up. And for all of you underdogs out there, keep working everyone every single day. Keep believing in yourself, so that you can make your dreams come true, too. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. Yo, Adrian! END
