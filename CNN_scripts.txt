COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Bad news it's only Thursday. Good news it's Friday eve and we're going to slay today. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and we have a powerful show for you today. And we start with the ongoing and devastating situation occurring in Nigeria in West Africa. A month ago, the country experienced its worst flooding in a decade. Hundreds were killed as homes and businesses were submerged. Weeks later, the death toll has risen and communities remain underwater, displacing more than one million people from their homes.  Victims of the flood blame the tragedy on the government's response or lack thereof. Government officials say they released flood warnings ahead of the disaster and advised residents to move to safer ground. There is a question as to whether those warnings even reach some communities and experts say proper relief has not reached many Nigerians. Food is scarce in the country and difficult for many to afford. Nigeria's economy is struggling. Inflation hit a 17-year high of over 20 percent in August. This has further strained people's spending power and capacity to relocate. People have lost everything and many survivors are living in terrible conditions in camps and shelters with little to no government assistance. CNN correspondent Larry Madowo has been reporting on this for us on the ground in Bayelsa, Nigeria, where he's seen firsthand the tragic events that people there are facing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Our communities still submerged nearly a month after the flooding began with no end in sight. Boats have become the only way to get around much of Bayelsa State in Southern Nigeria. The streets have turned to rivers, driving entire communities away from their homes.  We have really suffered, she says. Tell the government to help us. UGERE OBI, FLOOD VICTIM:  Again, tell them to come help us. MADOWO:  Everything you own is here under the water and this is your house? OBI:  Yes. Everything. MADOWO:  Some are living rough on the streets, washing with this water, cooking with it and bathing in it. Even people's homes and businesses and livelihoods are already submerged, it's still raining and there is more expected. The Nigerian government is warning this could go until November, so even more of this. This is Nigeria's worst flooding in a decade.  Aniso Handy has remained in this house through it all. ANISO HANDY, FLOOD VICTIM:  Nigerians are used to manage. If not, we would have all died. We have not seen this situation where people are not cared for. But Nigerians care for themselves. We are just like infants that have no father, no mother. MADOWO:  The feeling of abandonment runs deep here. The victims are disappointed with the Nigerian government's response which hasn't declared the flood a national emergency. The floods have affected 33 of Nigeria's 36 states partly due to well above average rainfall.  Bayelsa is among those cut off from the nation with major highways underwater. The situation has been exacerbated by poor drainage infrastructure and an overflowing dam in neighboring Cameroon.  But with a warmer climate causing more intense rainfall, authorities have also blamed it on climate change, angering some Nigerians. In this community though, there are more short-term consequences. It's a tough life to navigate for humans and animals alike, but life must go on.  Larry Madowo, CNN, Bayelsa State, Nigeria. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up today, a debate around driverless cars. Are they safe? Are they needed? Are they helpful?  Well, what do you think?  The technology continues to be tested in various cities around the U.S. and one company called Waymo just announced it's planning to launch robo taxis in one of America's most populated cities, Los Angeles. They've already been tested in Phoenix, Arizona, and San Francisco.  We're talking fully autonomous or self-controlled driverless rides relying on detailed maps and sensors to navigate their surroundings. Proponents say these electric vehicles would provide more eco-friendly modes of transportation, while opponents of safety concerns and say that technology is not quite ready to be taken mainstream. CNN transportation editor Michael Ballaban gives us a glimpse now at a recent experience he had with the full self-driving technology available in a Tesla. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL BALLABAN, CNN TRANSPORTATION EDITOR:  Oh, we've got a situation in front of us. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, no, we're going on the wrong side of the road. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Nope, nope, nope. It wanted to hit the truck.  This is a Tesla model 3. So we are turning on the full self-driving beta. Okay, the car is now officially technically sort of driving itself. Whoa, whoa, that was a really sharp turn the car just tried to make. Oh, we've got a situation in front of us. Whoa. Okay, what we just had in front of us was a UPS truck coming onto our lane. We had a guy in front of us with a cargo bike. To avoid hitting the guy on the bike, the car seemed to want to put us straight into a giant UPS truck. I would prefer not to hit a UPS truck today. So I took over. It does seem to need an interruption every couple of blocks or so. Sometimes if the car is hesitating a little bit I have to intervene. You also have to be ready to take over at any time. Now, this is challenging. Oh, no, we're going on the wrong side of the road. We're not trying to make this car screw up. We're not trying to have a laugh at Elon Musk's suspense. That's not the point. We're really just trying to see how it handles driving in the city.  So far, it's going okay. We're going down a pretty just straight normal road. There's not a lot of pedestrians here and when you're going down a straight road with not a lot of pedestrians, the car actually seems to be doing okay. We're doing right around the speed limit. You know, we're not hitting anything.  The car can see cones. The car can see trucks. The car can see even pedestrians on the other side of the street.  Seeing might not be totally the issue here, it's knowing what to do in challenging situations, stuff that experience teaches you. A lot of people have issues with this being called full self-driving. First and foremost, it's not fully self-driving, I have to sit here. If it was fully self-  driving as promised that would let you take a nap, while you're driving along.  You know, it does seem to be making all the drivers upset. It's the people behind us it's the people honking. Now I'm not saying of truly fully autonomous car will never happen but I think at this point we're still years away. SUBTITLE:  Tesla did not respond to CNN Business' request for comment. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  I like to think of myself as a fun guy, but I've got nothing on these guys. Did you know that mushrooms are the largest life forms on the planet? Yep, they expand and grow underground with interconnected fibers called mycelium, looking for food, often nutrients from soil and trees, alive or dead. In fact, the largest living organism on Earth right now is a single honey mushroom in the Malheur National Forest in Oregon. It's three and a half miles wide about 2,500 acres, and it's believed to be about 2,400 years old. Now, that's a humongous fungus and that's random. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  All right. Halloween is exactly two peace signs days away, and I am loving your costume suggestions that you've been sending me on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok. Lex Luthor, Mr. Clean, keep them coming. I'm @CoyWire there. And speaking of TikTok, 73-year-old sensation Barbara "Babs" Costello has given folks pumpkin to talk about. Carving tips like sprinkling cinnamon in there to treat your olfactory senses. Oh my gord. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBARA COSTELLO, TIKTOK SENSATION:  I'm going to remove all those nasty strings the easier way. SUBTITLE:  This 73-year-old TikTok sensation gave us some hacks on how to improve the spooky season.  In a new video, Barbara "Babs" Costello broke down the do's and don'ts of pumpkin carving.  COSTELLO:  Hi, everybody. It's Babs. Did your mom ever tell you the do's and don'ts of pumpkin carving? SUBTITLE:  1. Carve the pumpkin from your lap. COSTELLO:  Don't stand and carve your pumpkin. Sit. Just put them on your lap. SUBTITLE:  2. Carve from the bottom of your pumpkin. COSTELLO:  Now time to cut the bottom of your pumpkin, not the top.  SUBTITLE:  3. Use a hand mixer to clean out your pumpkin. COSTELLO:  Don't do this. Use your hand mixer instead. Get all those strings cleaned up. Your mixer did the hard work of loosening all those strings. SUBTITLE:  4. Use a red dry erase marker to design the face. COSTELLO:  When designing your pumpkin face, use a dry erasable red marker that you can get rid of the lines after you carve.  SUBTITLE:  5. Carve the design with a rubber mallet and a cookie cutter. COSTELLO:  If you don't want to struggle using a knife to carve your pumpkin, just use a soft-headed mallet and your cookie cutter, and just push it right through. Remove all your red lines. SUBTITLE:  6. Cover all surfaces with Vaseline to keep it fresh. COSTELLO:  Don't let all your work go to waste. Those kids want to enjoy these pumpkins. Take Vaseline and rub it on all the open cut surfaces. We'll keep your pumpkin moist won't dry out as quickly, and it should last about one to two weeks.  SUBTITLE:  7. And finally, sprinkle some cinnamon. COSTELLO:  And if you want a beautifully scented jack-o-lantern, try sprinkling some cinnamon right on the top and over the candle she goes and she smells delicious. Happy Halloween. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. You gorgeous creatures, today is National Civics Day, celebrating the importance of civic education as a foundation for a strong democracy.  And we want to give a strong shout out now, Walnut Cove, North Carolina, Southeastern Stokes Middle School. Rise up and have an awesome day.  It's almost Friday. See you tomorrow.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. It's your boy Coy, and it's Thursday. So, happy Friday eve to you. This is CNN 10. We have an awesome show for you today, so without further ado, let's do what we do. We start today with the latest news out of China. Foxconn, one of Apple's largest suppliers, is racing to control a COVID-19 outbreak at its campus in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou. Trending social media videos show anxious workers reportedly fleeing the lockdown facility earlier this week after experiencing food shortages and difficult living conditions, including mandatory isolation. The city, which has a population of more than 12 million people, identified dozens of COVID-19 cases last month and the Chinese government shows few signs of easing its COVID policies. These events highlight how China's strict zero COVID policy is hurting international business. We'll hear now from my colleague Selina Wang, the CNN international correspondent, reporting on the chaotic conditions at the Foxconn factory. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Chaos at Foxconn, one of Apple's largest suppliers. It's Zhengzhou factory, which is its largest iPhone assembly factory in central China, is trying to contain a COVID flare-up but workers are fleeing the COVID restrictions. Viral videos on social media show masses of workers carrying their luggage trekking long distances across highways. Workers in recent days have been flooding social media with complaints about subpar living conditions, the poor quality of food and the difficulty and getting enough food amid the intense COVID restrictions. The exodus is putting major strain on Foxconn at a critical period just before the holiday season. It's another reminder of how China's zero COVID policy is hurting international businesses. According to analyst estimates, the Zhengzhou factory accounts for as much as 85 percent of Apple's iPhone assembly capacity. According to Counterpoint Research, they estimate that this could jeopardize 10 to 30 percent of the iPhone-14 production if this situation doesn't stabilize in the near term. Now, according to state media, Foxconn is trying to boost capacity production at other sites. The company says it is actually quadrupling bonuses for workers at the Zhengzhou plant in order to incentivize workers to stay. But zero COVID is clearly still having a massive impact on businesses, on people's daily lives, the entire city of Zhengzhou, which is home to more than 12 million people, it's been under lockdown since late October. These constant lockdowns in China are causing global businesses to re- evaluate the reliability of China as a production base. In fact, Apple has been increasing production in places like India in order to reduce its dependency on China. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In Spanish, the word "manta" means what? Blanket, bread, balloon or basket. Manta refers to a type of cloak or blanket which is why manta rays share the name describing the look of the animal's large flat diamond-shaped bodies. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Today is CNN's Call to Earth Day, which aims to highlight the conservation work of organizations and individuals around the world and in connection with that. We have a special feature with marine scientists and Rolex Awards laureate Kerstin Forsberg who's working to protect manta rays in her home country of Peru. I recently had a chance to talk with her about her experience beneath the waves. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KERSTIN FORSBERG, MARINE BIOLOGIST AND CONSERVATIONIST:  The ocean is our source of life. The ocean touches us in every single second. It's, you know, connected with our atmosphere. The ocean provides resources. The ocean provides oxygen in our planet. The ocean provides so many different things to inspire us even on a cultural or emotional level. WIRE:  What made you fall in love with the ocean? Why did you choose this path? FORSBERG:  I was passionate about nature and environment and animals ever since I was a kid. I was always reading about animals, reading about nature. And then I think as I grew up and I decided to start a career in biology, it became really clear to me that the ocean was in real trouble, and that a lot of people needed to really start to think about the importance that the ocean has on our everyday lives. WIRE:  You have designed and developed dozens of environmental initiatives. What are some of the biggest challenges facing our oceans and ocean life right now? FORSBERG:  We're taking all the resources out of it. We're polluting the ocean. We're putting all our waste and dumping all their waste into it. So it's really about thinking of us as our everyday and how we connect to the ocean, and how we can depend on the ocean, but we can also shape the ocean. So, through sustainable seafood consumption, through making sure that we are utilizing our waste properly, and that's how we're going to ultimately stop those challenges which at the end are all about over-exposition, pollution and also climate change and habitat destruction. We started building a network of schools. It's called the Marine Educators Network of Northern Peru. And this network of schools started to grow, in over local schools in northern Peru, connecting between each other with teachers starting to incorporate ocean literacy within classrooms, but then building on that having youth start developing their own environmental projects that benefited their communities. First of all, we work with schools. We partner together with schools and with teachers and we develop an ocean literacy training program in which kids learn about the ocean, learn about how we're connected to the ocean. But even beyond that, they learn about environmental leadership and how to develop their own project. So we're giving them the tools on how to develop a project how to set out goals how to develop your own budget, how to track your progress and in doing that connect kids so we've developing feedback between each other and really developing this sense of global citizenship at the end, right? We all need to start connecting between our ourselves as global citizens in order to move forward and address sustainability challenges. WIRE:  Well, we have a special day, Call to Earth Day. I'm sure you have something up your sleeve or two. FORSBERG:  For Call to Earth Day, we will be hosting an activity in northern Peru, with over 40 different youth. These are local university students and we're partnering with a series of local organizations, including from the regional government and civil society and conservation areas. So, it's really about having everybody together. It's going to be a huge celebration, where different organizations come together, with different youth come together, and again, we're different disciplines, right? Come together, and ultimately, land and sea come together So, that's what it's all about for us, Call to Earth. It's a celebration of our planet that connects us all. WIRE:  Kerstin Forsberg, your -- your smile, your passion are contagious. You inspire us as we aspire to make this world a bit of a better place. Thank you so much for joining us. FORSBREG:  Thank you so much for the invitation. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, we may have bitten off more than we can choo choo. The world's longest ever passenger train took a trip through the Swiss Alps. What ingenuity, this train is 1.2 miles long, made up of a hundred cars, it had to be a slowcomotive, taking about an hour to complete a 15-mile trip, through 22 tunnels, over 48 bridges. The record-breaking event took place on October 29th, the 175th anniversary of Switzerland's first railway. For your news, for some fun, we're here for you train or shine. And so is shout-out time. Mrs. Bush's class at Bosqueville Middle School in Waco, Texas. Think it, speak it, believe it. Did you know that today, November 3rd is National Stress Awareness Day. So, like my four-year-old daughter tells me, smell the flowers, cool the soup. Whenever you feel overwhelmed, don't fret about the future. Don't worry about the past. Just take a deep breath and embrace the power of now. I'm Coy and this is CNN 10. END221103

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey you. You made it to Friday, and you already know Friday's rock. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. And we've got an awesome show for you today. Let's finish this week strong. I have some good news to start your weekend. Many of you get an extra hour of sleep on Sunday, Daylight Saving Time. But could this be the last year of it? Every year on the first Sunday of November at 2:00 a.m., many of us turn our clocks back an hour. On the second Sunday in March, they spring back forward an hour. But where did this idea of shifting time come from and why is it so polarizing? Let's take 10 to break it all down. While Benjamin Franklin gets credit for the first mention of the idea, Daylight Saving Time was first implemented in the U.S. with the Standard Time Act of 1918. A wartime measure with the purpose of adding more daylight hours to conserve energy resources Currently, not all states participate in daylight saving, including most of Arizona and Hawaii. Over 70 countries around the world use daylight saving time with notable exceptions of China and Japan. But earlier this year, the U.S. Senate passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act which would make Daylight Saving Time permanent year round, beginning in the fall of 2023. That bill is currently sitting in the House of Representatives. If passed there and then signed by the president, it would mean no more changing clocks in the U.S. There are, of course, arguments for and against the practice. We'll travel to the United Kingdom now to meet a small group of clockmakers who have a big job of making sure everything is working on time, especially when it comes to the time change. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX JEFFREY, CLOCKMAKER, PALACE OF WESTMINSTER:  I love talking about clocks. I could talk about clocks all day. Not everyone wants to hear about them, but everyone wants to hear about the clocks at the Palace of Westminster. Whether it's Big Ben, whether it's just being interested in such a busy building, working on clocks, doing the time change, maintaining, it's something I take a lot of pride in. REPORTER:  Ian Westworth and Alex Jeffrey are part of a small team of clockmakers at the Palace of Westminster in London. Twice a year, when the clocks spring forward or fall back across the United Kingdom, they have the responsibility of adjusting 2,000 timepieces before lawmakers return to work. JEFFREY:  There's two thousand clocks on the parliamentary estate. There's 500 heritage clocks, there's two days and it's our task to perform the GMT time change. IAN WESTWORTH, CLOCMAKER, PALACE OF WESTMINISTER:  And overnight, we changed Big Ben. The great clock of Westminster and we put that back an hour just to make sure everybody who can now see the dials can actually tell at the right time when they wake up on Sunday morning. JEFFREY:  So, this is one of our heritage clocks. There's around four or five hundred of them, and they're just going to bring the minute hand back to do the time change being careful not to graze the dial, and it's -- in one of the committee rooms along committee corridor where a lot of important meetings happen. WESTWORTH:  We have clocks here that pre-date this palace and some that were designed specifically for this palace. We do actually come across clocks that we've never found before. It only happened the other week. An MP contacted us saying, I've got a clock in my office, it hasn't run for some time. And I'm thinking, I've been here 18 years and I've never been into your office. He said that's probably why it hasn't worked. JEFFREY:  The time changes were put in initially as a mechanism, a practical mechanism to take advantage of daylight hours in the summer. So, it's important I think to keep that tradition. REPORTER:  In the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill championed the concept of daylight saving during the First World War before he became prime minister, believing that the country could save energy by stretching the hours of evening sunlight. The practice has spread across the world. In the U.S. most states observe daylight saving moving clocks forward in the spring. Only Hawaii and most of Arizona don't. In 2022, the Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act, a law which would make Daylight Saving Time permanent across the United States from November 5th, 2023. If passed by the House, the clocks would not fall back again. In the U.K., a 2019 poll showed that a small majority of Britons want to keep changing the clocks. At the Palace of Westminster, its resident clockmakers are responsible for maintaining this tradition. WESTWORTH:  Even with this digital world, you know, everybody's got a computer with a clock at the bottom or they've got a digital watch on. But the MPS and the lords or the staff, who've actually got a ticking clock in their office. One of the first things they look at is the ticking clock and not the one on the wrist. Our job is to make sure that every day, these clocks are working for them. The last clock of the day before doing great clock tonight. JEFFREY:  You know, there's a lot of ground to cover. I left my step count on last year and it was 55,000 steps. It's very time consuming but it's very rewarding. You know, we can say to each other, well done, guys. It's a job well done and when people turn up for work on Monday, they're right on time. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And now it's time for some hero talk. We've been introducing you to CNN Heroes since the start of the school year. Together, we met a woman upcycling old computers to open new worlds for young people in our home country of Kenya. We met a teacher in New Jersey on a mission to hand out free books by the thousands. This week, CNN announced the top heroes of the year. Let's meet them and hear how they are making this world a better place. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  From California when elderly dog owners can no longer care for their pets, Carie Broecker helps them stay together or finds these beloved family members new forever homes. From Nashville, Richard Casper uses art to heal the wounds of war. He's helping fellow veterans share their stories visually and vocally. Nelly Cheboi is bringing technology to young people in her native Kenya, recycling old computers, she provides the tools and education for brighter futures. North Carolina innovator Nora El-Khouri Spencer is training women for well- paying careers in construction while also helping seniors age safely at home. From south Philadelphia after spending five years in prison on drug charges, Tyrique Glasgow is now providing his neighborhood long challenged by poverty and gun violence with safety and opportunity. Alaskan nurse Teresa Gray leads volunteer medics into global hot spots, delivering vital care and support to those in need. Meymuna Hussein-Cattan is helping refugees and immigrants transition to lives in the U.S. with critical resources and support while also sharing their culture with the L.A. community. Aidan Reilly brought together a nationwide network of young volunteers tackle food waste and insecurity they're rescuing tons of excess produce from farms to feed the hungry. From Chicago, Deborah Vines struggled to find support and resources when her son Jason was diagnosed with autism. Now, she's providing services and education to African American families and first responders. And Atlanta's Bobby Wilson is feeding and healing his urban community by teaching thousands of people how to plant grow and prepare their own healthy food. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: American, Bridal Veil, and Horseshoe are features that combine to make what natural wonder? Great Barrier Reef, Niagara Falls, Grand Canyon, or Galapagos Islands. Located on the U.S. Canadian border, these are the names of the three waterfalls that together make Niagara Falls. (END VIDEO CLIP) WEIR:  We're giving this next story an A-plus, a gold star, and a 10 out of 10. Niagara Falls, one of the natural wonders of the world, on the New York and Canadian border, draws visitors from every corner of the planet who come to see its majestic cascading water. Well, there's a tunnel buried deep beneath the falls. It's been off limits until now. It's about seven football fields long it was built more than a century ago on the Canadian side as part of the former Niagara Parks Power Station. And visitors can now venture through the plant down the corridor and onto a waterside platform for some of the most breathtaking views in the world. This has been an awesome week.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  It is Monday and it's going to be the best day because it's the next day. I'm Coy, here with your news, some inspiration and a little bit of fun. Thanks for choosing us to help you start your week strong. We begin today with news on the Mississippi River. This video shows the river at historically low levels from Illinois to Louisiana. Experts say the record low water levels are due to the worst drought in the central part of the United States in at least a decade and that we can expect to see continued decreasing levels in the months to come. Lack of rain or snow over a period of time and atmospheric conditions such as temperature change and changes in the jet stream are all factors that can contribute to drought and low water levels. According to the U.S. drought monitor, half of the United States is covered by moderate drought conditions or worse, with more than 134 million people affected. That's the highest part of the population since 2016. And the Midwest has seen the worst of it. Several inches of rain are possible over the next week near the Mississippi River which could provide some relief but the drought is forecast to continue through January and low water levels have some serious consequences. They could impact crops at a crucial time for harvest and allow for salt water from the Gulf of Mexico to travel up the Mississippi River which could potentially spoil Louisiana drinking water with salt.  And while the Army Corps of Engineers has been dredging or excavating portions of the river's basin to make a path for boat traffic to keep flowing. It's at such a slow pace, hundreds of barges and vessels carrying goods are waiting for the all-clear to be able to pass through the shallow river. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  To navigate this river in the old South, a man would stand on the prowess steam ship and bounce a lead weight on a knotted string off the bottom. If it was a safe 12 feet deep, he'd shout "Mark Twain". Samuel Clemens made that his pen name, of course.  But if he wrote about this river today, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn would spend a lot of time walking on the beach because in too many places, the not so mighty Mississippi is a fraction of a Twain. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're going to look at a few old steamboats, steamboat racks. WEIR:  Mark Twain era steamboats? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah. WEIR:  And the relentless drought across the heartland is exposing all kinds of memories. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It may have caught on fire or sank 50 miles upstream and floated here during floods. WEIR:  As far as water levels go, this is as worse if you've ever seen? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is about as low as I've seen it. WEIR:  From the Missouri down to New Orleans, accidental archaeologists are finding steamboat graveyards and human remains, Civil War ammo and forgotten shipwrecks. And one of the more striking yardsticks is here in Baton Rouge. This is the USS Kidd, a World War II destroyer, and on a good year the Mississippi comes to that first rush strike, about 25 feet above my head right now. And these water levels are so low creating such a catastrophic shipping crisis that this is going to affect your grocery bill, is the price of moving. A bushel of soybeans went up 300 percent and there are thousands of barges full of food and all they can do is just wait and pray for rain. And if they can't get rain, they pray for help. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We've got a difficult stretch of river. WEIR:  From the Army Corps of Engineers, with billions of dollars on the line, they cut channels as fast as they can with working antiques like the Dredge Potter. Built in 1932 but still a workhorse and an endless fight with the river in every kind of weather. You're a professional riverbed redecorator. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kind of, yeah, yeah.  WEIR:  A little of this over here. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's right. WEIR:  Over there. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As long as we can keep barges moving and keep commodities prices down, we're all in good shape. WEIR:  That's your -- that's your mission. It's impressive to see up front. Andy, you know the Ole Miss better than most, huh? You've been doing this a while. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thirty-four years. (LAUGHTER) WEIR:  And how would you characterize what's going on these days? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is a concern, a heightened concern. I don't know that I -- we call it a panic yet, but we are watching the water levels very closely, on an almost an hourly basis.  WEIR:  Is it the kind of thing where if this goes on you can dredge around the problem? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  To a point. In 1989 and then again in 2012, we got to an area where the chan -- to a level where the channel was almost unsustainable. So we had numerous dredges working and there was very little commerce going through. And ultimately, what saved the day was rain. WEIR:  And these days, when you wish for rain, you have to specify not all at once. The Midwest is still recovering from summer flash floods. And if the water cycle whiplashes again, hard rain on parched earth would be another blow to farmers, already struggling to move their harvest.  Fewer and lighter barges on the river means more expensive trains and trucks putting more planet cooking pollution into Earth's system. And on a connected planet where one in eight humans eat something that was moved down the Mississippi, those hearty souls on the Dredge Potter are going to need a lot more help.

But everything from fuel leaks to hurricanes have already stalled the mission. Liftoff is now scheduled for November 14th and Artemis is back on the launch pad waiting for its big moment. But if you can't wait, there may be a way for you to get that moonwalking feeling right here on Earth. A new invention from Shift Robotics aims to make walking faster and more efficient. But will they revolutionize the way we walk? That remains to be seen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) XUNJIE ZHANG, CEO, SHIFT ROBOTICS:  Instead of replacing walking, what if we can augmenting or enhancing walking? REPORTER:  These are not roller skates, they are moonwalkers designed by Shift Robotics, a startup out of the robotics lab at Carnegie Mellon University. ZHANG:  I think the biggest problem is just the walking is too slow, it's super inefficient to get around by walking. So instead of replacing walking, what if we can you know augmenting or enhancing walking? REPORTER:  The company says these battery powered shoes can boost walking speeds up to seven miles an hour. Using a machine learning algorithm, Shift Robotics says the shoes can adapt to a user's walking pattern in real time. ZHANG:  You know, even though it has some elements of roller skate. You never freeloading, you just go -- they only move when you want to move. REPORTER:  Moonwalkers can fit most shoes with flexible straps that can be easily taken on and off with magnetic buckles. With speed limitation tech and braking systems the company claims the shoes are safe to use on on sidewalks or in crowded areas. ZHANG:  Outside the personal commuting or running errand scenes we think they're going to be great on distribution centers supermarket stores like warehouses for example where it's not fully automated but that still require lots of people walking around. REPORTER:  Shift Robotics also claims that users can walk over six miles after a single charge of an hour and a half. The company says it will deliver the first batch of shoes to consumers in March 2023 at nearly fourteen hundred dollars.  ZHANG:  I think at one day, you know, once we achieve economy scales, we will be able to drop the price we will be able to develop newer models that will allow us ultimately to drive the cost down.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is a hoot, a textbook example of parody by a parrot. TV reporter Nicholas Crum was in Chile telling a story about rising crime rates when a parrot pulls off an impeccable heist stealing the headphone right out of his ear. He gone. Crum, he needs to be more careful. He had someone else chase the thief for him so he could continue his report. Apparently, Crum suspected foul play. Well, the whole thing was caught on camera and where it is, he did get his headphone back. All right. Without feather ado, my favorite parrot of the day, I want to give a special shout out to West Side Middle School in Charleston, West Virginia.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, hello. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy. Grateful to be spending part of my day right here with you on CNN 10. Today is the first Tuesday in November and that means election day across America. Millions of Americans head to the polls to cast their ballots but they won't be choosing the next U.S. president. Americans will cast their votes for representatives in Congress and candidates for state and local offices.  Every two years, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for election while only about a third of the 100-seat Senate are up for grabs. These are called midterm elections because they happen two years into a U.S. president's four-year term. The midterms are the first chance for voters to weigh in on President Biden's term, policies and vision for America. All eyes are on Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania, four states that President Biden flipped to Democrat in the election but are now battlegrounds states that Republicans could win back. Issues at the top of mind for voters are, the economy, social issues, immigration, concerns about violent crime and concerns about election security and the election process itself.  This year, early voting has surged in some key states, including Georgia, which shattered records for early voter turnout but rain forecasted across the country today could impact voter turnout on election day. We'll hear more now from CNN's Karin Caifa about today's elections and what Americans might expect as results come in. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARIN CAIFA, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  President Joe Biden isn't on the ballot, but for most Americans, it's their first chance to weigh in on his party and policies. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This election isn't a referendum, it's a choice. It's a choice between two fundamentally different visions of America. CAIFA:  Among states taking center stage in the battle for the U.S. Senate tight races in four that president Biden flipped in the 2020 presidential election, Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania were Biden and former President Barack Obama stumped Saturday. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT:  Democracy itself is on the ballot. The stakes are high.  CAIFA:  And former President Donald Trump also rallied. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT:  This election is your chance to make your voice heard. CAIFA:  Underscoring how 2022 may foreshadow the 2024 presidential contest. Polls indicate most voters are looking at the economy right now as they cast ballots. Democrats touted Friday's October jobs report and unemployment still near a half century low as assigned their economic policies are working, while Republicans point to the highest inflation in 40 years.  SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI):  The inflation crushing our pocketbooks, can't fill up our tank, can't fill up our grocery cart. CAIFA:  Democrats hope the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June will motivate voters, especially women, while Republicans have accused Democrats of being weak on crime especially in major cities.  Both parties eager to drive turnout in their favor. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Name the peninsula in Egypt located between the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea. Sinai, Iberian, Arabian or Yucatan? Sinai peninsula is the answer here and at the southern tip is where you'll find the Egyptian city of Sharm El-sheikh. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  This week and next in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, tens of thousands of world leaders, representatives, negotiators, businesses and citizens will gather for the COP27 Conference. Twenty-seven because this is the 27th year that the global climate summit has been held. The focus of these conferences is climate change. The U.N. says this was a fringe issue when the summits began, but it's now a global priority though different nations have different levels of commitment to it. Carbon dioxide emissions are front and center here. Most scientists say these emissions are harming the global environment by causing earth's average temperatures to rise a smaller group of scientists says that climate change happens naturally and that the earth can absorb human carbon emissions. But the goal of these U.N. summits is for member countries to lay out new plans to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide. Let's take a look now at the history of these COP conferences as nations continue to debate the issues that relate to the health of the planet. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  COP stands for Conference of the Parties. The gatherings are intense technical negotiations brokered by the U.N. Countries are meant to work together to coordinate a global effort to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. But progress at successive COP summits has been limited. RAUL ESTRADA-OYUELA, KYOTO COP3 CHAIRMAN:  This is a very long process. It will take decades. PAULA DOBRIANSKY, HEAD OF U.S. DELEGATION, BALI, COP13:  We will go forward and join consensus in this today. LEONARDO DICAPRIO, UN MESSENGER OF PEACE: Now must be our moment for action. REPORTER:  The first climate COP summit took place in Berlin in 1995, and representatives from more than states or territories attended. Two years later, progress. The parties at COP3 in Japan agreed to the Kyoto Protocol in which 37 industrialized states or territories were legally bound to start reducing their emissions.  But the biggest polluter at the time the United States refused to ratify the agreement because it didn't oblige developing nations like China to cut emissions. In the following years, climate change slipped on and off the global agenda. After 9/11, the world's attention shifted to fighting international terrorism. Climate issues took a back seat. All the while, greenhouse gas emissions continue to soar and without the United States and China on board, the Kyoto protocol began to crumble, successive climate summits produced few results. COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009 was highly anticipated, but fell short.  BUYELWA SONJICA, SOUTH AFRICAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTER:  It's not acceptable. It's definitely not acceptable. It's disappointing. REPORTER:  Then at COP21 in Paris, there was a breakthrough. In 2015, the Paris agreement was adopted by more than 190 parties, including the U.S. and China, and effectively replaced Kyoto. Its ambition was to limit global warming to well below two, but preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But the watchdog Climate Action Tracker shows that all major economies are off track to meeting their obligations to contain temperature rise and as governments lagged in fulfilling their pledges a new wave of youth-led environmental activism was born. GRETA THUNBERG, CLIMATE ACTIVIST:  All what you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you? DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, before Paris, France. REPORTER:  Then, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris agreement, only for his successor President Biden to bring the U.S. back into it.  JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  This moment demands urgency. Good ideas and good intentions aren't good enough. REPORTER:  At COP26 in Glasgow, developed countries pledged $100 billion annually to support developing countries in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting their economies.  But the conference also had its shortcomings. India successfully demanded that the final agreement would commit countries to phase down rather than phase out coal. JOURNALIST:  It's according to science, sir. It's according to science. BHUPENDER YADAV, INDIAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTER:  No, not at all. REPORTER:  Fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas emit heat trapping greenhouse gas emissions. And if we don't cut those emissions dramatically, scientists predict global temperatures could warm by three degrees by the end of the century. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Now for today's 10 out of 10, we're bringing you a tasty story that's going to wake you up. People deep-fry chicken, they deep-fry potatoes. I've even heard of deep fried Oreos.  But coffee? How to even do that? James Hoffman, a coffee connoisseur and author, deep fried the coffee beans for 14-1/2 minutes. And he says it created a soft and buttery cup of Joe rich but not greasy, I guess you could deep fry just about anything. I think my weakness is French fries. I can eat them all day, every day.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Wonderful Wednesday to you. I know we're just halfway through the week, but we're going to keep on grinding and shining because that's just what we do. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10 and we've got a rendezvous with the news. Yesterday was election day in America. Millions of adults all across the country went to the polls to cast their votes for representatives in Congress, senators and state and local officials. The results were still coming in when we produced this show for the latest info check out CNN.com where results are updated in real time. But between early voting which shattered state records in Georgia and absentee ballots and the sheer volume of votes on election day it could be a while before we know who the winners are all eyes are on the results in Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia and Pennsylvania, battleground states that Biden flipped to Democratic states in the 2020 presidential election. But now, Republicans are hoping to gain control there. Experts say the 2022 midterm results could foreshadow the 2024 presidential contest. Polls indicate that most voters rank the economy as the number one issue on their minds, but women's rights, guns and public safety as well as immigration and election security are also major issues that are important to voters in this election. Let's hear now from chief national correspondent John King in the election center who explains the early signs he's looking for as election results come in. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Let's start in the House. JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Four hundred thirty-five races in all, under new lines because of the census two years ago, the redistricting process. As you know better than anybody, they're not all competitive. So, what we've done is we've identified working with our partners at inside elections, 82 competitive seats heading into election day. And as you can see, they are coast to coast. Another way to look at it, look at this, just to understand Democrats are on defense. It's a Democratic president's first midterm. It's a tough climate, just look down here at the key to these seats. BASH:  Yeah. KING:  Fifty-seven of the competitive seats have Democratic incumbents almost three times as many, almost three times as many of Republicans. There are three new seats here too as you look at the map. So Democrats are on their heels defending much more territory in a tough year. That's one way to look at it. Now let's bring it up, the big question is, who can get to 2018, right? And in our rankings right now, we already have Republicans favored in seats. Now some of those are just barely favored you see the lighter red on the map. But Republicans have a huge advantage going into election day and if you look down and, you know, the race is very well. These toss-up races go coast to coast. BASH:  Let's look at the Senate. Obviously right now, 50-50. KING:  Right. BASH:  It could go so many different ways. KING:  The chess game here, you can game it out. Reasonably, Democrats winning here, Republicans winning there were elections in all. Again, you work with -- we've worked with our partners here to identify the competitive seats. Eight elections of the Senate, we view as competitive. It could be more. Republicans think they could surprise us in some places of these eight. They're evenly divided now between held by Democrats or held by Republicans. Best way to look at this is to come into the balance of power as you come into the control right now. Again, Democrats enter the election, 50-50. The vice president United States breaks the ties. So Democrats can't afford to lose essentially. And so, you have the states on the map if you come in now to how we rank them, the goal or the toss-up states, one is a Republican held state right now, no incumbent Pennsylvania, Democratic incumbent in Georgia, the probably the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent you were just out there in Nevada. BASH:  Yeah. KING:  This is where the chess gets fascinating. BASH:  Yeah. And so many -- I mean, you're saying that these yellow are maybe the tightest, but that might belie what we're actually seeing on the ground, which is a wider swath of really, really tight races. KING:  But it is possible, again, we know these races are competitive right. But we still tilt New Hampshire Democratic, Republicans think they can pick up that seat. We still tilt Arizona Democratic; Republicans think that one is within their reach. They say watch, we still have -- this as likely Dem up in Washington state, in Colorado, Republicans say keep an eye on everything. So you could -- you conceivably could get Republicans to 52 or 53. You can also get the Democrats to 51 or stay status quo at 50. Again, this race could decide the Senate. In the end, does anybody get above or are we going are we going another month? BASH:  Or are we going to be standing here in December? KING:  On December 6th, but you were just out here. This is what Democrats worry about most. They view Catherine Cortez Masto as the most vulnerable Democrat and again think about the math, right? We won't know that one because it's out west, right? The Democrats would love to pick up Pennsylvania as a safety valve an insurance policy against maybe losing out in Nevada. BASH:  It is going to be a long and very exciting night. KING:  Week. BASH:  Maybe week. John King, thank you. KING:  Thank you. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In what sport would you find a gully, sweeper and a wicket keeper? Curling, bowling, cricket or lacrosse? The answer here is cricket in which the only field are allowed to wear gloves is called the wicket keeper. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Our next story involves the sport of cricket but it's about so much more than the intricacies of the game. It showcases a much broader dynamic of sports and highlights the importance of camaraderie, lifting each other up and setting aside differences to work together towards something greater than ourselves. Steffan Nero is visually impaired. He struggled to fit in, but his life changed when he found his squad, and he's gone on to shatter records. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUBTITLE:  Steffan Nero is not your average athlete. Born with two visual impairments, he struggled at school, failing to find a place where he felt he fitted in. After discovering visually impaired sports, Australian Nero started playing blind cricket and found new horizons. STEFFAN NERO, BLIND CRICKETER:  Sport is for me is such a big part of my life. like I can't really understate it, to be honest. I never really connected with other people my age regarding, you know, just obviously other people who didn't have the same obviously sight condition as me. But I usually felt quite lonely at high in high school. Sport, I would say, really changed my life and really pushed me to realize that I do have a lot of potential. I'd say I've flourished in a way. I became much more confident in myself. Part of a family, you're part of a group, you all dealt with the same experiences. You can speak to each other, and that's something that I really needed when I was growing up, because I think without it I've been a much more -- much different situation without those kinds of experiences. SUBTITLE:  Blind cricket differs from the able-bodied version in a number of ways. Players of varying visual impairments bowl a ball with internal bearings underhanded, allowing it to be heard. Nero etched his name into sporting history when he scored a record-breaking 309 not out innings against New Zealand. NERO:  Once I got the 300-mark, I was just like, okay, this is, you know, I can even make history here. When everyone was clapping as well, it was amazing feeling to experience and something I could say I'll never forget for the rest of my life. Obviously, it wasn't just me, but it was the team and my coaching staff, everyone, my parents, everyone. But still my name was said, Steffan Nero has made 309. So still a very special moment. SUBTITLE:  Although the response was overwhelmingly positive, there were still some negative comments around the record. NERO:  Majority of people obviously very crisp of saying, oh, wow, didn't realize this game that I think it can -- it helps to kind of change people's minds a bit about what disability means as well. I did hear a few comments saying oh you know it's just disability cricket. You know that kind of thing. But like I said a lot of people just making jokes about it as well, which happens, you know, that's the way it is on social media. After a while, I stopped looking at the comments and stuff as well and just kind of just ignored it and said, you know what, this is something that I think is really positive for blind cricket, for people with disabilities in Australia as well. SUBTITLE:  As well as furthering the sport, Nero wants to use his position to inspire the next generation. NERO:  I always say, if you try something, you don't like it, then that's fine. Unless you've tried it, you know, you're taking that first step. It probably will be the hardest thing you ever do, but once it happens and you're involved in that kind of group and that community, I think things get much easier and can be quite a really rewarding experience. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10 story might cause an uproar, and I ain't even lying. The Oklahoma City zoo needs names for its litter of African lion cubs, and it's asking the public to pick 'em. Born September 26 at the zoo's lion overlook habitat, these cute baby lions are the zoo's first in 15 years. Before the cubs are old enough to be put in public display though, they need names. But before you toss out names like Santa Claws (ph), Empe-roar (ph), or Kitty Purrie (ph), you have to cast your vote on a pre-approved name on a list on the zoo's website. Shout out time now. High five and a high 10 to Maclay Middle School in Tallahassee, Florida. Hope you all have a happy day. And remember, happiness isn't some idea that we have to chase or find or create. Happiness is right here, right now, whenever we choose to embrace it. Much love and many blessings. I'm Coy and this is CNN 10. END221110

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. I'm Coy Wire. Here to help you jump-start your week with the best minutes in news right here on CNN 10.  let's start today with an update on the midterm elections. Last week, millions of adults across the country went to the polls to cast their votes for representatives in Congress senators and state and local officials Democrats performed better than predicted. They are projected to retain majority control of the U.S. Senate after winning a pivotal race in Nevada.  Now Democrats will hold 50 Senate seats with Republicans currently holding 49. A December runoff election in the state of Georgia could earn Republicans a matching 50th Senate seat but Democrats would still hold a tie-breaking vote in the Senate which belongs to Vice President Kamala Harris. But the race isn't over yet Republicans may win the House of Representatives as votes continue to be tallied from a handful of districts. If Republicans win the House, they could still stop a significant portion of President Biden's Democratic agenda in his medical proposals. Congress makes nationwide laws. The House decides which laws are voted on, while the Senate can approve or block them and confirm appointments made by the president. Let's hear now from CNN's Jessica Schneider, a justice correspondent based in Washington. She has an update on President Biden's proposal to forgive some student loan debt which would need clear congressional authorization to go through. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  A federal judge out of Texas who is actually nominated by President Trump is now saying President Biden just does not have the power to forgive these student loans by executive order and instead, President Biden would need clear congressional authorization to forgive these loans and he would have had to go through more of a process rather than just simply issuing an executive order.  However, we will see an appeal of this decision. The Justice Department has already noticed that it will appeal and this is ultimately a decision that could be determined by the Supreme Court. Of course, President Biden issued this executive order in August. It's estimated that if it goes through, it would ultimately cost about $400 billion.  The program though now in doubt, and it's also been on hold for the past month because of another court decision out of a circuit court that put the loan forgiveness rollout on hold while all these legal challenges play out.  You know, we know that about 26 million borrowers already have applied for this debt relief. The government had already approved million of those applications, but no debt at all will be canceled for the foreseeable future here because of these court challenges. The White House press secretary did however say that the Department of Education will hold on to the information of all of these applicants so it could be processed pretty quickly if the program is ultimately given the green light in court. But we'll have to see how the courts decide this. If it does go all the way to the Supreme Court, it's possible that the conservative majority on the Supreme Court could nix this program as well. You know this has been a majority that's often skeptical of wide-ranging executive and agency action, so this debt forgiveness program could ultimately. Be deemed unconstitutional and if that happens none of these millions of people would get any debt relief. But for now this program is also on hold. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, a film crew searching the Atlantic Ocean for World War II artifacts unexpectedly swam upon something much more modern, a 20-foot long piece of the Space Shuttle Challenger which exploded shortly after liftoff in 1986. CNN's space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT:  It was the space shuttle's very distinctive heat shield tiles that really gave these divers their first clue that perhaps they had found a piece of NASA's old space shuttle Challenger and you can see in the video these white square tiles that are you know partially covered by sand now in the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean and those white tiles would have been used to protect the underbelly of the space shuttle from the very high temperatures that it would encounter as it re-entered the earth's atmosphere.  So the lead team member on this expedition, the guy by the name of Mike Barnett, he had a friend who was a former NASA astronaut. He showed him this video and that made them convinced that this is indeed what they had found. They brought it to NASA and NASA confirmed it, announcing the findings just this week. And so, the big question now is what does NASA do with this? By law, any piece of a space shuttle is NASA property. So NASA is trying to find a way to do something with this 20-feet section to do something that would really honor the memory of these seven astronauts that were killed back in January of 1986, including Christa McAuliffe who of course would have been the very first teacher in space. Kristin Fisher, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which U.S. government agency measures job market activity and working conditions? Department of Commerce, Department of State, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics? The Bureau of Labor Statistics serves as the statistical resource for the U.S. Department of Labor. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  For the past year, the job market has been strong. In October, the economy created 261,000 new jobs. But things may not quite be what they seem. Job hires dropped to a low not seen in more than a year and a half.  We'll hear now from CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich who's finding out why getting a job might not be as easy as some might think, and how some people are getting creative to get noticed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARLY PAVLINAC, JOB SEEKER:  I'm open to all options. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Karly Pavlinac is on stage in a high-stakes competition. The potential prize: a new job. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How do you make sure you're working with the right talent, you're finding the right connections? PAVLINAC:  The biggest thing is just being able to communicate the idea. YURKEVICH:  This is not the first time Pavlinac has done something unconventional to land an interview, since losing her marketing job in September. After she didn't hear back for a position at Nike, she sent them a cake with her resume on it.  PAVLINAC:  I've been applying obviously that hasn't worked yet, so let me throw something new in the mix and see if that you know works. YURKEVICH:  Her resume cake making headlines.  PAVLINAC:  I've since talked to a bunch of people at Nike but still no job. YURKEVICH:  But the economic data tells a different story. The jobs market is strong. There are 10.7 million open positions, labor shortages and hundreds of thousands of jobs being added each month.  Yet some job seekers even with a viral cake moment can't seem to land one. LIZ ANN SONDERS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST:  On the surface, this is still fairly strong labor market. But if you go a couple of layers under, you are starting to see more significant cracks in the surface that suggest we should eventually see it in those more popular headline type labor market readings. YURKEVICH:  Cracks like a slowdown in hiring, as seen in this week's job opening survey. Hires dropping to 6.1 million, the lowest since February 2021, and the tech industry is shutting jobs percent more than last year.  PAVLINAC:  My perception of the job market was there were a ton of jobs out there and it was going to be easy to find a job, and that actually hasn't been the case. YURKEVICH:  Another crack of the 10.7 million open jobs, some companies might be advertising positions they aren't actively trying to fill. PAVLINAC:  I have applied to many jobs that they're still sitting there, that's been a giant question in my head.  YURKEVICH:  It's called pipelining talent. Companies post jobs to develop a pool of candidates. Recruiter Laura Mazzullo says she sees companies do it all the time. LAURA MAZZULLO, FOUNDER, EAST SIDE STAFFING:  Candidates don't know that's what's happening. So they're being pipelined when actually they think they're applying for an active job and this is where we're seeing a bit of a disconnect.  YURKEVICH:  That may mean as the labor market weakens, job seekers can't be as picky. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our goal is potentially to give away two jobs tonight. PAVLINAC:  I have been picking in that sense of where I want to work but I know what I want. I'm still searching, still talking to people. I've come to terms that it is taking longer than I thought. YURKEVICH:  Vanessa Yurkevich, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10 is from Minnesota man James Rasmussen as we head into the holiday season. He's hoping to avoid the terra bowel experience he had last season. He couldn't figure out who-who was cutting his outdoor Christmas lights. Turns out it was the owl who stole Christmas, using the lights to deck its own halls, its nest under Rasmussen's deck. Critters, there's no talon what they'll do. Better luck nest time Mr. Rasmussen. Without further owl do, a special shout out now to Ryan Middle in Fairbanks, Alaska. Wishing you and everyone watching around the world some motivation this Monday.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy. Grateful to be spending part of my day with you right here on CNN 10. We have a great show today, so let's get to it. We're going to begin with the news out of Bali where the G20 Summit is taking place. The global 20 is an intergovernmental forum between countries that addresses major issues related to the global economy. President Joe Biden held a three-hour talk Monday with the president of China, Xi Jinping. The meeting was their first in-person encounter since President Biden took office and an opportunity for both countries to improve deteriorating relations. Dialogue between them hit a new low in August when U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, a choice that upset China. Expectations for major change were low headed into the meeting. The White House said in a statement afterwards that President Biden raised concerns about China's human rights violations, but that the two countries found areas of agreement especially when it came to the war in Ukraine. In addition, the two nations promised to work together on global climate issues, world health and food security, and they pledge to keep communication open. But at the heart of the U.S.-Chinese relations is the Taiwan question. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Will Ripley in Taipei. The capital of ROC, the Republic of China, commonly known as Taiwan. This island is a vibrant democracy of $23 million people and a key ally of the United States, about 100 miles from mainland China. SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  And I'm Selina Wang in Beijing the capital of China, officially called the People's Republic of China. The PRC was founded in by the victorious Communist Party after a bloody civil war. RIPLEY:  On the losing side, the nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek who had ruled since the 1920s, they fled here to Taiwan where the ROC flag still flies today. Two sides both claiming control of one country, a decades-long dispute, halting travel and trade and leaving a lingering threat of war. WANG:  Initially, both the United States and the United Nations recognized Taipei as the seat of the Chinese government. But amid the shifting political relations at the height of the Cold War, that changed in the 1970s. The PRC replaced the ROC at the U.N. and the United States changed diplomatic relations. It moved its embassy from Taipei to here in Beijing. While the U.S. has adopted a so-called one China policy, it has never recognized the communist party sovereign claim over Taiwan. Washington continues to sell weapons to Taipei, but it has remained deliberately unclear about whether it would come to Taiwan's defense in the event of a Chinese invasion. It keeps Beijing guessing. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You know, you hear people saying Biden wants to start a new Cold War with China. I don't want a cold war with China. I just want to make China understand that we are not going to step back. We are not going to change any of our views. RIPLEY:  That looming threat of invasion is only part of China's ongoing campaign to squeeze Taiwan. Decades of diplomatic pressure by Beijing means this island has very few formal diplomatic allies, because any nation that wants to normalize relations with China has to sever formal diplomatic ties with Taipei. The island's Olympic team can't even carry the Taiwanese flag. They have to compete under the name Chinese Taipei. In Singapore, in 1992, the two sides did agree at least in theory to the existence of one China. WANG:  It's impossible to overstate just how important Taiwan is to the ruling communist party and its legitimacy. China sees the self-ruled island as a breakaway province that must be reunified with the mainland, even by force if necessary. Reunification is also rooted in the communist party's goal to reverse China's century of humiliation by colonial powers. That means returning China's borders to something more like that of the Qing Empire. It's the basis of modern China's claims to Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong and Taiwan. RIPLEY:  Putting sovereignty on the back burner gave Taiwan's economy a boost. Cross strait trade, tourism and money moving again. In 2015, the ruling parties on both sides met again in Singapore, a historic summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Taiwan's then President Ma Ying-jeou. One year later, a turning point. Taiwan's 2016 election of Tsai Ing-wen, the island's first female president, leading a longtime pro-independence party. Tensions rising ever since, something Taiwan blames on China's plan to push its power across the Indo-Pacific. Taiwan's young democracy divided on the issue of unification with the mainland. The tide is turning. In 2020, Tsai won a landslide re-election, vowing to defend Taiwan's democracy from she's increasingly powerful and authoritarian China. Cross strait ties plunging to their lowest level in decades. TSAI ING-WEN, PRESIDENT OF TAIWAN (translated):  The broadest consensus among the Taiwanese people and our various political parties is that we must defend our national sovereignty, our free and democratic way of life. On this point, we have no room for compromise. WANG:  With U.S.-China tensions at an all-time high, Washington and Taipei have moved closer. In 2016, then U.S. President-elect Donald Trump broke a decade-long precedent and spoke to President Tsai on the phone. He also elevated official exchanges between Washington and Taipei, a move that infuriated Beijing. RIPLEY:  China's refusal to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine has many here asking, what is Beijing planning for Taiwan, testing the island's defenses, flying scores of warplanes near the island, making President Xi's long-standing calls for peaceful reunification ring hollow? REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  We will not allow China to isolate Taiwan. RIPLEY:  In August 2022, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi became the highest ranking U.S. lawmaker to visit this island in 25 years, a move Beijing call a major political provocation. In response, China launched military exercises beyond the median line encircling the island. During her visit, Pelosi delivered the unequivocal message that America stands with Taiwan. But if the time comes, would the U.S. send in American troops to defend this Chinese-speaking democracy, a democracy with an uncertain future? (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: When compared to Earth, the atmosphere of Mars is? Thinner, thicker, or about the same? The atmosphere of Mars is over 100 times thinner than Earth. And actually, that thin atmosphere on Mars presents challenges for NASA. (END VIDEO CLIP) A new initiative from NASA called LOFTID could be a potential solution and will determine if a giant inflatable shield could protect spacecrafts against the heat of re-entering the atmosphere. The shield can withstand 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit and at feet in diameter, it's also the largest blunt object ever to return from space. The technology would help spacecrafts enter Mars's thin atmosphere because the Martian atmosphere can't decelerate a spacecraft as quickly and coolly as Earth's atmosphere. And we're ending today's show with a bang for 10 out of 10. Check out this massive explosion in western Kentucky. Drop them like it's hot. These three structures are actually cooling towers at a closed coal plant. The towers were 435 feet tall until they weren't. Tennessee Valley Authorities said the blast was done on purpose to clear the land for future use. The dramatic footage shows the towers slowly collapsing to the ground with clouds of dust all around. The Drakesboro, Kentucky, plant was active for nearly 60 years before effectively closing in 2020. And now to my favorite part of the day, I want to give a special shout out to Crown Point High School in Crown Point, Indiana. Go Bulldogs! Thank you so much for watching.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, everyone? It's Wednesday. Are you hanging in there? Let's smell the flowers and cool the soup.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10.  Just a few more days and we are on the Thanksgiving break. So let's rock. We're going to start today though with news out of India, where air quality is an ongoing issue.  New Delhi, India, is the world's most polluted capital according to IQAir, a Swiss company that measures air quality. It's blanketed in smog every winter as the cold air traps dust in the atmosphere above the city.  In March of this year, firefighters battled ablaze in New Delhi at a landfill site. The fire cloaked the area in a toxic haze and smoke choked residents for days. Factories, construction sites and primary schools were ordered to shut down, and Delhi authorities urged people to work from home. There's currently a debate in India over how to handle waste. There's no processing of waste in most Indian cities, according to the government's central pollution board and in some cases trash is simply burned in open dump yards on the roads. Delhi's 24-hour air quality index measures the concentration of harmful pollutants. Anything over 300 is considered hazardous and New Delhi's levels are as high as 470. The government is attempting to take stricter measures to tackle air quality as there are major health concerns for citizens in India.  We'll hear more now from Vedika Sud, a CNN reporter based at the New Delhi bureau who will introduce us to some of the people impacted by the poor air quality and explain the science behind the toxic air. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  Seventy-two-year-old shopkeeper Narayan Choudhary suffers from chronic asthma. He says he almost died in April this year after the landfill behind his house which is the size of a village caught fire.  NARAYAN CHOUDHARY, SHOPKEEPER (through translator):  It was a massive blade. It was difficult to survive. My face and nose started swelling. I was gasping for breath. I could barely drink or eat. SUD:  Choudhary says had it not been for his friend who rushed him to hospital, he wouldn't be here today. It was a dangerous combination of methane, unsegregated garbage and record high temperatures earlier this year that sparked massive fires not only at the Bhalswa landfill but also here at one of Asia's biggest dump sites. Government data from 2019 says this Ghazipur landfill is almost stories tall and the size of s soccer fields. Methane is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas and one company GHGSat found on a single day in March as trash decomposed more than two metric tons of methane gas leaked every hour from the Ghazipur landfill. STEPHANE GERMAIN, CEO, GHGSAT:  When we take all the measurements that we took over a period of about a year, we found that the total emissions were equivalent to emissions from approximately 350,000 U.S. passenger vehicles per year. SUD:  And methane emissions aren't the only hazard. Dangerous toxins from landfills seep into the ground polluting the water supply for thousands of residents living nearby. That's the color of the water, a pale, dirty yellow and we're barely hundred meters away from the foothill of the landfill. In May, CNN commissioned two accredited labs to test the groundwater around the Bhalswa landfill. The result, the groundwater within at least a 500-  meter radius around the wayside is contaminated. According to the labs, it's unfit for drinking.  In the first lab report, the total dissolves solids from all three samples were off the charts. Amid other parameters, levels of ammonia and sulfate was significantly higher than acceptable limits mandated by the Indian government. Results from the second lab report were equally worrying. Also iron traces in the first sample for both lab reports were at least eight times more than the permissible limit. And while authorities bring in a supply of clean water, residents say they're simply not enough for this densely populated neighborhood, and that they must buy and consume purified water.  As part of his Clean India Initiative, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said efforts are being made to remove these mountains of garbage and convert them into green zones. That goal if achieved could stem the suffering of those residents living in the shadows of these dump sites and go a long way to curb the massive amounts of methane being released into the atmosphere.  With more than 3,100 landfills, the task is monumental and so far unrealized. And if decisive action isn't taken soon, the consequences on the global climate fight could be catastrophic and the toll on human life unimaginable. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In what U.S. city would you find the famous museum complex nickname "the nation's attic"? New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles or Raleigh? The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. is home to 19 museums, 21 libraries and is home to over 154 million eclectic holdings. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Up next, we're traveling to Raleigh, North Carolina, to show you how big tech is making that city one of the fastest growing in the United States. Raleigh even gained the recognition as the Smithsonian of the South because of its booming art scene and all the free museums you can choose from. Let's check it out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  If you were to list the great art and educational centers of the U.S., you might think of New York or D.C. But you might be missing one, here, Raleigh, North Carolina. Raleigh has long been a museum Mecca with a vibrant art scene. Now, big companies like Google and Apple are moving into the area, helping to make it one of the fastest growing cities in the U.S. And as the city's grown, Raleigh has gained more recognition as a cultural destination. The area boasts more than locally owned art galleries, over 60 performing art spaces, and 140 pieces of public art in the downtown area, not to mention over 50 historic sites and 17 museums, most of which are free, leading some people to call Raleigh and its abundance of cultural institutions the Smithsonian of the south. VALERIE HILLINGS, DIRECTOR AND CEO, NORTH CAROLINA MUSEUM OF ART:  The state of North Carolina from the 20th century realized what an important thing it was to offer to its citizens free museums, giving everyone an opportunity to learn about and experience different subjects. We opened our doors in 1956. REPORTER:  The North Carolina museum of arts collection stretches across different cultures and eras. It has dedicated galleries to Rodin, Jewish ceremonial art. It even has an infinity mirror room sculpture by Yayoi Kusama, who has been nicknamed the most Instagramed artist in the world. HILLINGS:  As I like to say, all art is once contemporary and all art becomes history. We began to move single artworks around into other galleries, unexpected galleries, that really changed how people saw this collection. One of the Wileys has been a real fan favorite as it's been paired with an earlier portrait of King Louis showing two young men having a great sense of swagger., REPORTER:  The museum also has the largest connected art park in the country, at a whopping 164 acres. HILLINGS:  It becomes like an outdoor art gallery. REPORTER:  The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences is the largest of its kind in the Southeast and home to millions of plants animals gems and to the second biggest earth on Earth. CHRIS SMITH, COORDINATOR OF CURRENT SCIENCE PROGRAMS, NC MUSEUM OF NATURALK SCIENCES:  It's accurate down to the most minute detail. There's a lot of great ways to get close to nature here at the museum and a lot of great ways to learn about what's going on in the state of North Carolina.  One of the main highlights, the reasons to come visit are the whale skeletons. That whale the Smithsonian tried to take it and we were like no, we want it. These are dinosaurs that would have lived in prehistoric North Carolina. This is an eastern glass lizard and very active this morning good to see him out. There are 50 states, North Carolina is the best because North Carolina has a little bit of everything that everybody loves. REPORTER:  Whether you're interested in history, modern art or even Harley- Davidson drag racing, Raleigh's got you covered. HILLINGS:  Many of the things you can see not only in New York but at museums worldwide, you can see here in North Carolina. But also you can see things you won't see anywhere else.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANNOUNCER:  Five, four, stage engine start, three, two, one -- booster's ignition and liftoff of Artemis I. We rise together back to the moon and beyond. (END VIDEO CLIP) COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Happy Thursday, everyone, or as I like to say happy Friday eve. I'm Coy. Thankful to be hanging out with you. Time for the best 10 minutes in news right here on CNN 10. Let's rise together. We start today with the liftoff of the rocket we just saw. Yesterday, NASA launching its long-awaited Artemis moon rocket. The mission was a long time and a lot of money coming. NASA has spent more than billion dollars to date getting Artemis off the ground. But there were scrubbed launches hurricanes and mechanical issues that delayed takeoff for months. But the rocket finally got off the ground. This mission kicks off a key test of America's ability to send astronauts back to the moon. Can you believe the last time humans were on the moon was way back in 1972? That's 50 years ago. But hold on a moon-it, there won't be any humans on the moon just yet. There's no crew for this expedition. The rocket will come within 60 miles of the lunar surface before flying forty thousand miles beyond the moon and then looping back to Earth over three weeks' time. The journey will conclude with a splash when the rocket lands at sea on December 11th. We're going to hear now from CNN's space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher about the first test flight of the Artemis moon rocket. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT:  This is, of course, an uncrewed first test flight for the Artemis moon rocket. It is a SLS rocket, the space launch system rocket, with the Orion crew capsule on top. And so, what we've seen over the last few hours is launch and then the capsule separating from the rocket, and the rocket falling back to earth. And now, this little capsule, the Orion capsule, is now making its way to the moon. It's going to take about five or six days to get there. When it gets there, it's going to fly by very close to the moon just about feet off the lunar surface before then traveling farther out into space than any spacecraft ever designed to carry humans has ever flown, before flying back to earth testing out that all-important heat shield at the base of the Orion capsule before splashing down into the ocean. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia, Thanksgiving themed. What type of food was definitely not present in 1600s New England when Pilgrims first arrived? Cranberries, pumpkin, potatoes or corn? Potatoes which are native to South America hadn't been introduced to North America yet. They weren't established crops there until the 1700s. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Officially, one week away from Thanksgiving now. What's your favorite thanksgiving side dish mashed potatoes cream corn cornbread or stuffing or dressing as some folks like to call it? Whatever you love, be sure to really love and appreciate it this Thanksgiving. Because due to inflation, Thanksgiving dinner will cost 20 percent more this year than last, and that was already considered the most expensive Thanksgiving ever. We'll hear now from chief business correspondent Christine Romans on what you and your families can expect at the grocery store this holiday season. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  On the menu this year for Thanksgiving, rising prices. Overall, prices are up 7.7 percent from last year and grocery prices are more than 12 percent higher than a year ago. Here's what it means for the family grocery bill as you shop for the big day. First, the turkey. Per pound prices for turkey are up 17 percent year-  over-year. An average frozen turkey costs roughly $2.38 cents a pound. That's up from a $1.74. Now you can blame the avian flu outbreaks and hire fuel feed and labor costs because of inflation running near 40-year highs. What about eggs? Eggs cost 43 percent more than a year ago. Butter and margarine are up 33 percent. Flour is up nearly 25 percent. Your pies are going to cost more to make. These higher prices could potentially change Thanksgiving plans. A new Wells Fargo report suggests some Americans may opt to eat out rather than shop and cook at home this year. Dining out also can be cost the report says, but it may be a better value than one might expect. Government data backs that up year over year the cost of dining out rose at a slower pace than the cost of a typical grocery store run. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Speaking of Thanksgiving grubbing, one of the best parts is eating leftovers in my opinion like for days and days, right? But we all know some people get skeezed out by that. Did you know though that the United States wastes 108 billion pounds of food each year? Well, maybe it doesn't have to be like that. CNN reported on the science behind food storage with expert tips on how to best store your food and to keep your leftovers from going bad. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  The kitchen is the heart of our homes and fortress for our fresh food. Taking pride of place, these gleaming apples and bananas might look safe now, but when you open the fridge or cupboards a few days later, you can find your once fresh ingredients in a very different condition. And this often comes down to how you put them away in the first place. BRITTANY TOWERS LEWIS, FOOD SCIENTIST:  A lot of food is wasted. People buy in bulk and then end up not eating it. REPORTER:  So much food in fact that if food loss and waste were a country it would be the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases. To keep food for longer and help the planet and your household budget in the process, there are a few things to keep in mind. LEWIS:  One is time. So obviously the longer you keep something, it will eventually go bad. Oxygen, there's a lot of reactions that happen if you've heard of oxidation. That kind of causes apples to go brown, for example when you cut them. Moisture can increase microbial growth, which is something that we want to prevent because obviously bacteria, molds, light can also cause foods to spoil a little faster. Like potatoes, they're exposed to light. They can turn green. They produce sprouts for example. REPORTER:  So, to avoid waking up to potatoes like this, you should keep them in a cool dark place, in a breathable bag to avoid moisture, and away from fruits such as bananas. This is because bananas are climacteric foods which means they produce a lot of ethylene. LEWIS:  Ethylene, very fancy term. It's a gas that causes fruits and vegetables to ripen. That's why a lot of times when people are like, hey, you want to ripen something put it in a bag with a banana, because bananas produce a lot of ethylene. So, it'll cause it to ripen faster. REPORTER:  Salad leaves are another victim of bad storage, resulting in this all too familiar kitchen scene. LEWIS:  If you notice kind of your leaves aren't lasting as long a really great way is to rinse them off and make sure they're completely dry. Vinegar not only will help kill or monitor bacteria but it's also very acidic. So, most bacteria also don't like acidic environments. REPORTER:  And remember the role moisture plays. LEWIS:  Bacteria love water and that's what they use to grow. So, the more water you try to take out, the longer that they last. So, if you put a little paper towel in, keep it in your refrigerator, that will help keep the lettuce a little longer. REPORTER:  But when it comes to herbs, a little H20 used correctly goes a long way. LEWIS:  If you cut the bottom stem part off and kind of put them in some water, in your refrigerator, that can help keep them a little longer. They're like a living plant. So, they're in their little water and they're drinking it up, instead of in like a bag from the grocery store that kind of just like harbors just bacteria because everything's like stuck together. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10 is fantastic. Scientists discovering never seen before deep sea creatures at the bottom of the Indian Ocean near the Cocos Islands, an Australian territory. These fish are freaky. There's a deep-sea batfish looking like a baby Yoda thingy. And then this previously unknown species of blind eel. I mean, it makes me wonder what else could be down there or do we even want to know? All right. All my so-fish-ticated folks, it's about that time. I want to give a special shout-out to Marianna High School in Marianna, Florida. We see you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. We made it to the weekend. Friday's rock especially when they lead into a nice long holiday vacation. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and we are pumped to be right here with you to finish this week strong. We're starting today by concluding our months-long coverage of the midterm elections. Let's reflect. On November 8th, Americans cast their votes for representatives in Congress which consists of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, and they also voted for candidates for state and local offices. The elections are called midterms because they happen in the middle of a president's four-year term. After a close race and days of counting ballots Democrats retained the Senate, while Republicans won the House of Representatives. This means Republicans can stop a significant portion of President Biden's Democratic agenda. Remember, Congress makes nationwide laws. The House decides which laws are voted on. The Senate can approve or block them and confirm appointments made by the president. The candidates who won their position will take office this January so we won't see any changes until then. Pretty soon, the next batch of candidates will start campaigning for the elections in 2024 where the big race will be for president of the United States. We'll be here through the whole process updating you on the latest with no opinion or slant, just the facts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What country will host the 2022 World Cup? Japan, France, Qatar or Australia? The Middle Eastern nation of Qatar will host the 2022 international soccer tournament which kicks off on Sunday. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  The World Cup, it's one of the most popular sporting events of all time. Every four years, the best players from across the planet represent their nations in an epic soccer tournament. The world cup kicking off this Sunday in Qatar is the men's tournament. The women's is next year, and more than one million people are expected to travel to Qatar. That's more than a third of the nation's entire population. This year's tourney has been described though as the "World Cup of chaos". For the first time ever, it's not being played in the traditional summer months because for the first time ever, it's in the Middle East where the Qatari desert would have been scorching hot during that time. So, players in top leagues across the world are having to play this World Cup in the middle of their club seasons, meaning they'll be exhausted. Also, the country of Qatar has been criticized for its human rights record. More now from CNN anchor and correspondent Isa Soares. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEPP BLATTER, FORMER FIFA PRESIDENT:  The winner to organize the 2022 FIFA World Cup is Qatar. ISA SOARES, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The sports world was stunned when FIFA awarded the World Cup to Qatar. Controversy took center stage and football risked becoming a sideshow. Why was Qatar, a tiny desert state with no football pedigree, chosen to host FIFA's showpiece event? Even the disgraced former chief of football's governing body has since described the decision as a mistake. BLATTER:  I was right at a certain time to say it is -- we should not go there. SOARES:  That move, 12 years ago, provoked unprecedented anger, accusations of corruption, and sportswashing. Qatari officials strongly denied the allegation that bribery was involved in their bid. Before a ball is kicked at the year's tournament, attention has focused on Qatar's human rights record. Its stance on same-sex relationship, and most damaging to its reputation, the treatment of overseas workers drafted in to build essential infrastructure. Amnesty International claims authorities failed to properly investigate the deaths of thousands of migrant workers despite evidence linking premature deaths with unsafe working conditions in the searing heat. Qatari officials say they investigate all reports of abuse and exploitation and are committed to holding unscrupulous employers to account. When the final whistle goes at Qatar 2022, the legacy will be judged not only over 28 days of football but in the years that lie ahead. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, this is a sad and uncertain time for many people across the tech industry. Many workers are scrambling to seek new opportunities. Fears of recession, rising interest rates and a shift to pre-pandemic lifestyles have all dealt major blows to the tech industry. More than 35,000 tech workers across 72 companies have been laid off just this month, for a total of 120,000 tech jobs lost this year. We'll hear now from CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich who has more on the future of the industry. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In three weeks, the tech industry lost tens of thousands of jobs. Historic layoffs at Twitter, Meta, Lyft and Amazon. Layoffs.fyi, a crowdsourced layoff tracking site, puts it at more than 35,000 layoffs so far this month. ROGER LEE, FOUNDER, LAYOFFS.FYI:  That's the highest month since the pandemic. So that beats April 2020, which was 17,000 employees laid off. YURKEVICH:  Meta cut its workforce by 13 percent. CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying he's taking accountability and apologizing to those impacted. New owner Elon Musk slashed half of Twitter staff with founder Jack Dorsey tweeting: The company grew too quickly, I apologize for that. And Amazon is laying off ten thousand workers this week, citing an unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment. NELA RICHARDSON, CHIEF ECONOMIS, ADP RESEARCH INSTITUTE:  There were big investments made during the pandemic time while the rest of the economy for example was plummeting by 3.4 percent. Tech grew by four percent. YURKEVICH:  But in a post-pandemic high inflation world, consumer behaviors and spending habits are changing, with the threat of recession on the horizon. RICHARDSON:  I take this as a sign that maybe companies got over their skis at some point right and they're trying to kind of sit upright again. YURKEVICH:  Roger Lee founded layoffs.fyi as the pandemic unfolded. Recently, he's been digging deeper into the numbers. LEE:  There have been many companies who have been letting go half or more of their recruiting HR teams just because they're not hiring as many people anymore. YURKEVICH:  Aaron Backman, a recruiter at a tech company, was one of those layoffs. What did that feel like for you? AARON BACKMAN, LAID OFF FROM TECH COMPANY:  It was a really awful feeling. We were told really early in the morning an email saying layoffs are coming today. And if you get a call, it's going to be you. And I sat there for six hours on slack and watched my colleagues get laid off one by one. YURKEVICH:  Then he got the call. BACKMAN:  It's depressing. YURKEVICH:  As American workers watch tech giants shed jobs at a rapid clip, many in other industries are asking, am I next? Should they be nervous? RICHARDSON:  First of all, the tech economy are just two percent of the labor market. Tech is an important part of the economy but it is not the whole of the economy. The rest of the labor market is looking pretty good. The economy is adding jobs at a pretty healthy clip. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's out 10 of 10 is quite relephant to what we do here at CNN 10.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, everyone?  Hope you had an awesome break and had some time to reflect on the things for which you are thankful, something for which I'm grateful is all of you and I am pumped to be right back at it so we can finish 2022 strong together, just 34 days remain in this year. We start today with news out of China. Protests have erupted all across the country, citizens taking to the streets in an unprecedented challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping's zero COVID policy. Hundreds of people in China shouting the phrases "Step down, Xi Jinping. Step down, communist party", and "Don't want COVID test, want freedom". The Chinese government has faced mounting anger at its zero COVID policy which attempts to isolate every case of COVID in the country and shut down the surrounding areas. Even almost three years into the pandemic, COVID tests, incessant lockdowns and quarantines have plagued the country. The protocols have kept China's infection rate lower than countries like the United States. The government, though, faces complaints about the economic and human cost as citizens are isolated for weeks at a time with limited access to food and medicine, while the country suffers economically.  A deadly fired an apartment block in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, killed 10 people and injured nine more on Thursday. After the event video suggested that COVID lockdown measures delayed firefighters from reaching the victims. The incident has been a further catalyst to the widespread anger and defiance against the government, which is rarely seen in China, a country where the communist party cracks down on all dissent. We'll hear more now from CNN international correspondent Selina Wang based at the network's Beijing bureau with more on this movement. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Anger is rising and tragedies are mounting but China shows no sign of budging on zero COVID. Authorities are clamping down with more lockdowns, mass testing and quarantine, and people are getting more and more frustrated. Adding to the anger is a fire that broke out in the capital of China's far west Xinjiang region on Thursday night. Ten people were killed and nine were injured in a fire at an apartment building in Urumqi.  Most parts of Xinjiang have been under lockdown for more than a hundred days. The deadly fire sparked nationwide outrage because widely circulated videos which have now been censored in China show that COVID measures, COVID lockdown measures very likely delayed firefighters from getting to the scene.  Now, state media claims that people in the compound were allowed to leave the building, that it was considered a low-risk COVID area. But video shows fire trucks unable to get close to the scene because the compound entrance was partially blocked. The video shows it's blocked with fences tents and metal barriers that are normally used as part of COVID measures.  The videos also show smoke and flames coming from a high floor of the building but the water failing to actually reach the fire. What adds to the tragedy is that those who died in the fire likely spent their last three months largely confined to that building if not entirely.  The fire really struck a cord with the public here because we've seen scenes of tragedy and suffering play out over and over again since the start of the pandemic. Countless stories of people struggling to get enough food daily necessities and emergency care and lockdown three years into these draconian policies, frustrations are more frequently turning into public protests which are normally rare and authoritarian China.  Last week, in the southern city of Guangzhou, some residents revolted during lockdown by tearing down barriers and marching through the streets. There were violent clashes at the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou this week. But still, there's no end in sight to zero COVID. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What type of star is the sun? Yellow Dwarf, Neutron Star, Red Dwarf, or Supernova? According to NASA, the sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old Yellow Dwarf star, at the center of our solar system. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next up, we'll hear how Heliogen, a renewable energy company in California's Mojave Desert, is using concentrated sunlight to power more than just your home. This new tech startup wants to replace fossil fuels with concentrated sunlight. But unlike traditional green energy suppliers, this startup is able to store fuel to create power even when it's dark outside or cloudy.  But while the company has major financial backers, it's not a perfect solution. Stock prices are low and some question whether Heliogen can execute on a large scale. We'll hear now from CNN business producer Jon Sarlin. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JON SARLIN, CNN BUSINESS PRODUCER (voice-over):  In California's Mojave Desert, renewable energy company Heliogen is working to harness concentrated sunlight for more than just powering your home. Using artificial intelligence, these mirrors can produce the extremely high temperatures needed to make things like concrete, steel and green hydrogen. So behind you are these mirrors reflecting light. Tell me what they're -- what are they doing? BILL GROSS, FOUNDER AND CEO, HELIOGEN:  We're taking a field of mirrors. Each one of them being moved precisely by computer algorithms to reflect the sunlight to a single spot up on the tower behind us. At that single spot, we're achieving temperatures that are almost a third the temperature of the surface of the sun.  SARLIN:  What do you turn what these mirrors are projecting into? GROSS:  The end result is we get very high temperatures so we can make steam for heavy industry, we can melt aluminum, we can melt steel, we can make concrete.  SARLIN:  It's the algorithm that separates Heliogen from other concentrated solar power ventures. Heliogen doesn't need complex mirrors. Instead, they use cameras and computing power to align their mirrors to reflect sunlight onto a refinery tower. This process creates temperatures of about a thousand degrees Celsius and all of that heat is directed and stored in big thermos-like containers. GROSS:  So the energy continues after the sun goes down or even on cloudy days. We hold enough energy for a week of no sunshine, so that industry can run 24/7.  SARLIN:  Concentrated solar power is a renewable energy resource that's been around for decades to generate power, but with mixed success. Its primary disadvantage has always been the hours of the day the sun isn't shining.  Heliogen's process solves this problem by storing its heat and making green fuel like hydrogen that can be used to fuel electric generating stations. Okay. So you have this concentrated light source. You're using it for power, for industrial uses, and for what else? GROSS:  Because we have continuous electricity. We can make hydrogen. So hydrogen is a miracle substance. It's the most common element on earth.  SARLIN:  Heliogen is using the thermal energy it creates to make hydrogen. Ironically, most hydrogen is made using fossil fuels, which has limited its production. What Heliogen is doing is making the process of creating a clean fuel clean. GROSS:  We already moved a molecule all over the earth in the form of oil and gas. Hydrogen is also a molecule which we can transport. So why is that so important? The United States can be an energy exporter, a renewable energy exporter. SARLIN:  So are we there yet? GROSS:  We're there. This is happening. Where we really need hydrogen is for trucks, for airplanes, for long distance transportation. All the places where hydrogen is made right now in a dirty way, we're going to make it in a clean way.  SARLIN:  So the question though is if we can do it, we can do it in the lab. But can we do it on scale? GROSS:  We are doing it at scale. That's what you're looking at here. SARLIN:  At scale? GROSS:  At scale. This is a scale technology with a multi-acre field gathering the sunlight from multiple acres, concentrating it, and using that high temperature energy to split water and make hydrogen. SARLIN:  The company has major backers like Bill Gates. But still, Heliogen has faced obstacles. Your stock price has faltered over the last year. Is the business at where you want it to be? GROSS:  Absolutely. In all businesses, your timing has to be perfect. So what's happened in the last year or so that makes the timing perfect? Well, fossil fuel prices have tripled. So all of a sudden, you can go to business and say, I'm going to install a system for you that takes away the volatility, you'll have control over your own energy production and I'm going to meet or beat your price and with zero emissions.  The sun is a resource that no one owns. It gives us ten thousand times more energy than the whole humanity needs and it's available for everybody. So the innovation can happen everywhere.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. And we've got a rendezvous with the news, so let's go. We're going to begin with news on the economy regarding the most wonderful time of the year, the holiday season, traditionally a big season for shopping as well. This year, many shoppers are returning to their pre- pandemic routines, going back nearly three years now. Shoppers are expected to shop big around some key dates like Black Friday last week, but they're also predicted to make major purchases later in the shopping season, hoping to land deals.  This year, inflation has limited many shoppers budgets though. But retailer experts say that customers are pulling back on discretionary spending like furniture and electronics and are being more selective about what they buy. Many Americans are dipping into their savings accounts and racking up debt to make purchases as well. They're also utilizing services like buy now pay later, which is a type of installment loan people might use instead of a traditional credit card. Let's break it down by the numbers. Online, Black Friday sales in the United States topped a record-breaking $9 billion this year, and were over two percent higher compared to last year. U.S. shoppers spent a record $5.29 billion on Thanksgiving Day, up nearly 3 percent from a year ago.  Experts are predicting that American shoppers spent more than $9.5 billion across Saturday and Sunday, and that Monday will be the biggest online shopping day again, growing more than five percent from last year to $11 billion. But some of that growth reflects higher prices, not necessarily higher volume, due to inflation this year. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSIENESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  On this year's holiday shopping menu, more sales but with a healthy side of inflation. DENISE SALLETTE, HOLIDAY SHOPPER:  Cutting off your circulation. I'm going crazy. YURKEVICH:  Denise Sallette is in the middle of her holiday shopping at Willowbrook Mall in Wayne, New Jersey.  SALLETTE:  This is for my mom. And then I got stuff for my kids and my niece and, oh my God.  YURKEVICH:  This year, the wish list is looking a little different. Last month, inflation cooled but was still running hot at 7.7 percent year-over-  year. SALLETTE:  I've had a cutback on shopping because things are too expensive. I mean, I do have three girls. They do understand that, you know, times are hard right now and it's just me being a single mom. YURKEVICH:  Despite high inflation, the National Retail Federation estimates that nearly 8 million more people will shop between Black Friday and Cyber Monday and spend up to eight percent more this year than they did last year. MATTHEW SHAY, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL RETAIL FEDERATION:  We're looking at records in all categories. It is remarkable in the face of the cost and the price pressures that consumers are still finding a way to increase their spending power the economy, drive economic activity. YURKEVICH:  Last month, retail sales beat expectations, up 1.3 percent in October. But this month, consumer sentiment fell. Still, higher prices haven't stopped some people from shopping. Has that impacted the way you're going to spend this holiday season? CYNTHIA PENDELTON, HOLIDAY SHOPPER: For me, not really because I try not to overspend anyways. So even before this is going on, I try not to exceed what I can do.  YURKEVICH:  And according to the National Retail Federation, while online sales are expected to increase this year, a return to in-store shopping will make up a larger portion of all holiday sales. PENDELTON:  I kind of like in person more. YURKEVICH:  You do wise up. PENDELTON:  I don't know. It's just more of the feel of being able to touch it, being able to see it, being able to try it on for the stores that you allow to, and then being amongst everybody else. YURKEVICH:  It's that holiday nostalgia that Willowbrook Mall says will help this year's shopping season return to pre-pandemic expectations. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What group of islands is the most isolated population center in the world? The Galapagos, The Solomon Islands, Hawaii, or The British Isles? Answer is Hawaii. Surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the U.S. state is over 2,000 miles from California, nearly 4,000 miles from Japan. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Up next, the world's largest active volcano. The Mauna Loa in Hawaii, it's erupting for the first time in nearly years. The eruption is prompting an ash fall advisory for Hawaii's big island and surrounding waters.  The good news, there's no evacuation notice at this time. Lava flows are contained in the summit area and are not threatening to harm downslope communities according to the Hawaii Volcano Observatory.  The bad news is asphalt from the volcano could damage vehicles and buildings, contaminate water supplies, disrupt sewage and electrical systems. It could even damage or kill vegetation.  Mauna Loa has erupted 33 times since 1843 and covers half of the island of Hawaii and it's only 21 miles west of one of the most active volcanoes in the world, Kilauea, which is also currently erupting. When it erupted in 2018, it destroyed more than 700 homes. All right. From lava to dragon eggs. There's new drone technology that's improving an effective technique used to prevent wildfires, right? But it might not be what you think, not a soaring fire extinguisher or a water dropping drone. They're drones that drop fire in the form of, quote, dragon eggs to perform something called prescribed burning or starting a fire in order to avoid one later.  But some experts say that the technique is dangerous for firefighters. CNN business producer Jon Sarlin is here with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JON SARLIN, CNN BUSINESS PRODUCER:  This fireball-dropping drones are improving one of the oldest and most effective ways of preventing extreme wildfires, prescribed burning. CARRICK DETWEILER, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, DRONE AMPLIFIED:  Prescribed fires basically work by doing a very low intensity burn that will burn up the dead leaves and sticks that would cause major wildfires when they dry out later in the summer. We can reduce these huge wildfires by using more fire when it's safe to do so. SARLIN:  Many experts say prescribed burning should be used more often but it can be dangerous for firefighters.  DETWEILER:  They're often hiking out into the middle of mountains with a drip torch or they're riding an ATV and then you have helicopters with the whole crew on board flying really low and slow over the fire about a quarter of all while then firefighting fatalities are related to aviation. And for me, this really was a motivation to get these systems into the hands of firefighters. SARLIN:  Robotics researcher Carrick Detweiler started his company Drone Amplified to make prescribed fires safer, easier, and less expensive. DETWEILER:  Our system doesn't cover the amount of area that a helicopter can, but you can deploy tens or hundreds of our systems for the same cost as a helicopter. SARLIN:  On a 50-pound drone, Carrick secures a device that can carry 400 fireballs that ignite when they land on the ground.  DETWEILER:  We call these dragon eggs. They have potassium permanganate when you mix it with glycol, it starts a chemical reaction and a fire. SARLIN:  The drones allow firefighters to work at a distance from the flames and areas difficult to reach due to terrain or visibility. DETWEILER:  And this is really doubling the amount of time that firefighters can fight the fire when it's dark, when it's smoky, when other airplanes can't be out there. You can drop the balls in specific locations and this lets you do much more precise burns. SARLIN:  Precision is important, because even though prescribed burn escapes are extremely rare, the outcome can be devastating.  Two recent controlled burns in New Mexico led to the state's largest wildfire on record. DETWEILER:  Our system can help prevent escaped fires through the use of thermal cameras. You can see through smoke and look for any fires outside of the fire boundary. Our app also allows the firefighter to put in geofences to precisely control where the fire is starting and this lets the firefighters actually control the intensity of the fire. SARLIN:  Carrick says a hundred of their drone systems are now working for clients like the U.S. Forest Service and other federal agencies. But in the future, they envisioned similar systems in the back of every firefighter's truck. DETWEILER:  When firefighters are widely deploying these, we'll really be able to get up to doing more prescribed fire that's needed to mitigate these wildfires. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, we're taking a journey to the far side of the moon, and it all starts with a selfie. NASA's Orion spacecraft snapped a selfie as it approached the moon. The spacecraft was eight days into its and a half day mission at the time. The journey will go more than forty thousand miles beyond the far side of the moon and if Orion completes its journey, it'll be the farthest a spacecraft intended to carry humans has ever traveled. This selfie was snapped with a camera, on one of the capsule's solar panels. Pretty cool if I do say so myselfie.  And now on to my favorite part of the day. Special shout out to Calhoun Middle School in Denton, Texas. We see you.  Today, November 29th is Giving Tuesday. Every year on a Tuesday after Thanksgiving, people take time to give back.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, everyone? It's Wednesday. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and you are awesome. We're going to start today with a follow-up on the World Cup being played in the Middle Eastern country of Qatar. Yesterday was a huge soccer match between the USA and Iran, not just because it was a win or go home match for USA or that it was a win or draw or go home for Iran, but because of the political talking points surrounding the match. Some World Cup teams have been showing solidarity with anti-regime protesters in Iran who are fighting for women's rights. Some Iranian players even refrained from singing the national anthem ahead of their first match to show solidarity with protesters. But things really got heated when the U.S. Soccer Federation altered the Iranian flag on one of their graphics online, removing the Islamic emblem from the center of it. As a result, Iran called for FIFA, the World Cup organizers, to ban Team USA from the World Cup. That didn't happen, all this adding attention ahead of the match. Players from both sides while they do care about issues outside of sport, they really want to just focus on the game and their dream of playing in a World Cup. On Tuesday, the match finally arrived, and CNN correspondent Andy Scholes was at a watch party to take in the action. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDY SCHOLES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  The party is on here in the U.S. at Fado Irish pub in Atlanta, Georgia, as Team USA is moving on. They had only scored one goal since June and that was against Wales last week, in their opening game of the World Cup. The fans here tense, waiting for the goal because they had to win the game. A tie wouldn't cut it this time around. And into the 38th minute, this place just exploded when Christian Pulisic came through with that goal to give the USA the 1-0 lead. They would hold on to win by that final score and they are now moving on to face the Netherlands. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was incredible. I thought we played the first half brilliantly. Towards the end, I was a little scared when we went defensive. But in the end, it all worked out. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So proud, so ready to the next round. I think we're going to kill it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This team is young, they're hungry, they don't 90 stop minutes strong. We got through it today. So happy, unbelievable win for the USA. Let's go baby all the way. SCHOLES:  And, Coy, as you can see this win meant so much for Team USA and their fans. And, hey, the good news is we get to do it all over again on Saturday. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. As we mentioned yesterday, the world's largest active volcano, Mauna Loa in Hawaii, has erupted for the first time in nearly years. Its neighbor, the Kilauea volcano, sits just 21 miles away and it began erupting more than a year ago. So, this rare dual eruption is expected to attract visitors from all over the world actually. Next, we're traveling to Hawaii with senior national correspondent Sara Sidner who recently flew over volcanoes in Hawaii to get a better understanding of the changing landscape and the science behind and under volcanoes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA SIDNER, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  As the sun rises each morning here in Hilo, Hawaii, it reveals destruction and creation happening simultaneously at the heart of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. I witnessed this from new heights with pilot and volcano expert Samantha Hanson. From up above, the full scale of volcanic activity is clear. SAMANTHA HANSON, PILOT:  If you look out here across the horizon, you see all these like little mini mountains out here, and these are all cinder cones. So, they're almost like many volcanoes right on the side of the big volcano. This whole thing right here that we're flying over right now, this is Mauna Loa. This is the largest volcano on the planet. SIDNER:  You really see how the lava spread out. HANSON:  Yeah. SIDNER:  I mean, it's very apparent. HANSON:  If you were to cut the island in half, it would look like Swiss cheese. It's just riddled with these lava tubes. As the island gets bigger and bigger, right, there's lava tubes, kind of, you know, build on each other. SIDNER:  But most of the volcano isn't what you see here. It's underwater where eruptions can and do occur, like the massive explosion in the waters off Tonga, just one of the over potentially active volcanoes worldwide, capable of creating earthquakes, tsunamis and entirely reshaping the landscape. One of the most devastating eruptions in Hawaii happened here in 2018 at Mount Kilauea where we joined volcanologist Kendra Lynn. KENDRA LYNN, VOLCANOLOGIST, U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY:  This was most significant collapse event that's really been recorded and observed since Western visitors arrived at the volcano. SIDNER:  Lava at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit crept across the island oozed over homes and roads and burst out of fissures. The eruption went on for over 100 days, destroying more than 700 homes and forcing thousands to evacuate. That one event dramatically changed the landscape. LYNN:  Here at the summit, almost daily, there was a magnitude earthquake as all of these rocks just started to collapse in on themselves and create the new crater. Which are kind of larger. SIDNER:  And the destruction brought a new course of exploration for Kendra, the study of rocks and how they form. LYNN:  We often looked to the rock record and the different types of rocks that are preserved around the volcano to understand past behavior. We look for patterns that might clue us into how the volcano will behave in the future. SIDNER:  Is there any prediction as to when the next eruption might be or what it's going to look like? LYNN:  It's difficult to say when, but we do know for sure that it will happen again someday. SIDNER:  Scientists are working hard to determine just how catastrophic that eruption might be. MICHAEL NEWMAN, PARK RANGER, HAWAII VOLCANOES NATIONAL PARK:  What's really remarkable about Hawaii is that it's a living landscape. It's a place where the volcano breathes. We can see the steam breathing from the crater. We can feel the movement of the earth. We can see land being created as we speak, and it's a place where we can really become in touch with nature. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these American retailers started in 1886 as a watch company? Sears, Target, Big Lots, or Costco? Considered to be the Amazon or Walmart of its day, Sears went on to become one of America's biggest retailers. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Once America's largest retailer and business employer, with an extensive retail network, Sears has struggled in the 21st century. It had more than 350,000 employees in 2006. But today, there are only 15 full-line Sears stores still open across the country and the company filed for bankruptcy years ago. We'll hear now from CNN's Rachel Crane on the slow demise of the iconic chain and how it was once both the Amazon and Walmart of its day. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RACHEL CRANE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Sears is in trouble, closing thousands of stores and losing billions of dollars. But once upon a time, Sears transformed the way Americans shopped. Back in the late 1800s in Minnesota, Richard Sears was spending his days as a railroad station agent, until one day, he sold some watches from a local jeweler and realized he was really good at selling. So, in 1886, he started a mail order company, the RW Sears Watch Company, and eventually hired a watchmaker Alva C. Roebuck. And in 1893, Sears Roebuck and Co. was born. Sears then became a very successful mail-order catalog company. This business model broke the mold. Remember, most Americans were living in small towns with access to only a few stores. They often made their own clothes and furniture or did without. Sears early catalogs only featured watches and jewelry. But soon these catalogs were more than 500 pages long, people could buy anything, from shoes, wagons, stoves and musical instruments. Sometimes, people even bought their homes directly from Sears. And because Sears bought in bulk, the company was able to charge customers lower prices. In 1925, Sears opened its first retail location in Chicago, and it wasn't just retail. Sears had a radio station, a mortgage business, a credit card. Sears was everywhere. Annual sales hit one billion dollars in 1945. The next year, sales doubled. Once Americans started to move to the booming suburbs after World War II, Sears began investing to help build malls. By 1970, Sears was considered untouchable by its rivals. But not all stories have a happy ending. As the 20th century came to a close, so did Sears' reign. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, check out this house.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Can you believe it's December 1st already? I swear it feels like it was just November yesterday. But no, just like that, only one month remaining in this year, so let's make it great. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we're starting with news out of China today, where protesters are taking to the streets in a rare display of defiance against the country's ruling communist party. The people are rising up against the zero COVID policy, a strategy that China has been using to limit the spread of COVID. But while the policy has kept China's virus levels lower than other large countries, it's placed millions of people under lockdown and quarantine, limiting their access to food medicine and family. It's also hurting the economy and restricting travel. Anger boiled over last week when a fire in an apartment building killed at least 10 people. Some believe the tragic deaths could have been prevented were it not for the anti-virus restrictions that may have prevented first responders from arriving more quickly. The authorities aren't messing around when it comes to shutting down the demonstrations and acts of defiance online as well. Hundreds of armored vehicles have been deployed to the streets. Authorities have vowed to, quote, strike hard if necessary. The number of people detained as a result of the resistance is not known at this time but the punishment for protesting in China can be severe. Senior international correspondent Ivan Watson has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  China's police state strikes back, flooding the streets of Beijing and Shanghai with police, an unmistakable show of force after a weekend of unprecedented protest in at least 15 cities across the country. In the eastern city of Hangzhou Monday night, police arrested people in a central square. And an eyewitness tells CNN police searched people's phones on the Shanghai subway, looking for apps that allow users to circumvent Shanghai's strict Internet censorship. The communist party's domestic security committee ordering officials to resolutely strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces, as well as criminal activities that destabilized social order. No compromise for peaceful protesters to voice their opinion. Meanwhile, health officials striking a slightly softer tone, calling for shorter lockdowns in the Chinese government campaign to eradicate COVID-19. CHENG YOUQUAN, CHINESE CTR. FOR DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION (through translator):  We need to minimize the inconvenience to the general public because of the anti-COVID-19 measures. As for the high-risk regions, we must have rigorous control. But at the same time, we should spare no effort to provide services to meet people's basic living needs and medical needs. WATSON:  A carrot and stick approach from different parts of the Chinese state, after the biggest nationwide display of discontent that this tightly controlled country has seen in a generation. Ivan Watson, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, we're going inside a cryptocurrency mine. Unlike the dollar, the euro, yen, franc or pound that you can put in your pocket, cryptocurrency is completely digital. It's created with encrypted computer algorithms. Many experts are quick to point out the issues with crypto, though, including market instability bankruptcies lawsuits and how it can actually harm the environment because the computers give off massive amounts of heat. That's why they're stored in crypto mines. We'll go now to northern Sweden with CNN reporter Anna Stewart who's found a mind that may be more sustainable for the environment if their plans to use the heat to grow things we can eat come to fruition. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER:  Well, this is what a crypto currency mine looks like the frozen rows of computers, in fact, there are 116,000 here. As you can hear, it sounds pretty noisy, and I can say that it feels really hot up close to these machines. There's about a 30 degrees centigrade difference though between here and here under one of the big bends where you're getting the cold air from outside. So, you can feel the energy that is coming out of these lots of power a small city, one of the reasons crypto mining can be just so controversial. But that is why Hive Blockchain Technologies have set up shops here in the north of Sweden. Come take a look why. Outside, some 500 meters along the River Lulea is a hydrogen power plant, a source of abundant cheap and renewable energy. JOHANNA THORNBLAD, PRESIDENT, HIVE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES:  This is the energy that is powering the Boden community and our data center that is located just nearby so this is also one of the main reasons that Hive has decided to bet on the Boden community. STEWART:  Given Europe is in an energy crisis, there will be people that think this is renewable energy. Should it be used for crypto mining? Shouldn't it be used to power people's homes and industry, keep lights on in hospitals? What do you say to them? THORNBLAD:  There are not enough inhabitants or companies to use all the energy that is available, so the community of Boden was inviting data centers to come to use this renewable stranded energy really. STEWART:  One crypto mining company is not just turning a profit in the midst of a crypto winter but also trying to forge a greener future, there are nearer term plans to turn the excess heat from the crypto mining into something more fruitful. THORNBLAD:  In the spring, we're going to support a Swedish company called Actira (ph). So they're building a huge, big greenhouse just at the back of our data center. And so, we will have tomatoes and cucumbers grown all year round in the very north of Sweden. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What is the geographical region at the base of South America which covers parts of Chile and Argentina? Colombia, Patagonia, Marmot, or North Face? Patagonia is your answer here, a nature lover's paradise where you could hike the Andes Mountains. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next, we head to Patagonia on the Chilean side, home to some of the most tantalizing topography and wondrous wildlife on the planet. The remote and rugged coastline region in south America is known for its gorgeous glaciers, beautiful lakes and rivers. But this region may be in danger. We'll meet Vreni Haussermann now, a marine biologist studying the wildlife in the region. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VRENI HAUSSERMANN, MARINE BIOLOGIST, SAN SEBASTIAN UNIVERSITY:  For me, Patagonia is the most beautiful part of Chile. It's a very remote, very wild and rugged coastline. Full of green forest, temperate rainforest, has lots of glaciers, rivers, lakes and the coast is very steep. The marine life came from deep waters but also from adjacent areas and so the diversity we find in fjords is elevated compared to other coastlines. My name is Vreni Haussermann. I'm a scientist working at the University of San Sebastian and I'm studying the marine biodiversity of Chilean Patagonia. Diving in Patagonia, we found many species that haven't been described before. The coastline is more than 100,000 kilometers, which is twice around the world. Only a handful of scientists working there. So even if we studied all the main areas, there are still most parts that we don't know yet. Chilean Patagonia was free of human impact for a long time, but in the '80s when aquaculture moved in, it started to be impacted. Life in the fjords has been reduced in abundance. There are species we hardly don't find anymore. By impacting an area where we know very little about, we always have the risk that we are damaging ecosystems and the equilibrium of the ecosystems is lost. I hope that humanity understands the need of protect our planet. I hope humanity understands the need of protecting the oceans and our lives and the lives of all future generations depend on a healthy ocean and a healthy planet. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, a reminder that it's never too late to right a wrong. In Minnesota, a library book was finally returned after being checked out 47 years ago. For decades, a Mercedes-Benz repair manual was missing from the shelves but earlier this month, it was mailed back with 200 bucks and an anonymous handwritten note saying that the sender had been fixing their car and although they probably couldn't afford the late fees maybe the library could buy a new book instead. Hope that dude finally got his car fixed. And you know I went to a bookstore the other day and saw a book called "How to End 50 Percent of Your Problems". So, I bought two. Shout out time now. Hanover Online School in Ashland, Virginia, thanks for subscribing typing and commenting on our YouTube channel. And thanks for all the love, @CoyWire on Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok. It is Thursday. So happy Friday eve people. My team and I are already working on a plan to finish this week strong with you right here on CNN 10. END221202

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. What a wonderful day. It's Friday and you already know Friday's rock. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, where we break down big news stories and easy to understand explanations with reporters all over the world, no opinion, no slant, just the news and we love having some fun with you. Starting with some good news today. Hurricane season is officially over in the United States. The hurricane season runs from June 1st to November 30th. And this season was notable for several reasons. One, it was calm the first half of the season. No hurricanes from July 3rd to the end of August, for the first time now since 1941. But the second half, three destructive hurricanes did hit the United States. Here's a breakdown: despite the slow start, there were 14 named storms, eight hurricanes, two of them major, registering category 3 or higher. Hurricanes Ian, Nicole and Fiona were among the most notable. Hurricane Ian made landfall as a category 4 storm, killing nearly 150 people, destroying homes and businesses. Tropical storm Ian also caused more than $50 billion in estimated damage. Several hundred Florida Keys residents marking the end of this hurricane season by gathering on Wednesday to celebrate. They burned hurricane warning flags. Some people though are still cleaning up damage left behind, mourning loved ones taken by storms. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In which of these U.S. states would you find a zip code that starts with a number 1? New York, California, Texas or Florida? Zip codes starting with a one represents New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next up, I want to introduce you to a very special principal who's empowering her students and defining her school's sense of pride. Principal Lisa Caldwell Linder from Brownsville neighborhood in Brooklyn came from what some would consider a rough neighborhood. But she always believed that she could rise above any of the negative aspects surrounding her and she did. Over time, she coined a phrase: "I am not my zip code". And she's using that phrase now to empower her students at her school and make them realize that they too can rise up higher than others might assume as possible. Meet Principal Lisa Caldwell Linder. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATHALY WARNER, FORMER ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL:  Ms. Linder sees natural abilities within people. KADIR ELLISON, FORMER STUDENT:  That's what I loved about her, that she just kept us on the right track. TRISTAN MILLS, JR., FORMER STUDENT, ASSISTANT BAND DIRECTOR:  Ms. Linder honestly gave me a safer environment. LISA CALDWELL LINDER, PRINCIPAL, PS/IS 184 NEWPORT:  My favorite phrase is "don't let the zip code fool you", because a lot of people do that. I am a product of Brownsville. My zip code growing up was 11212, and I'm sure if we Google one, one, two, one, two, all of the negatives will be exposed. I want our students to feel good regardless of their zip code. PS/IS 184 is a haven for learning. Attendance might be a challenge for a lot of our students because a violent crime may have been committed in the -- in the neighborhood, may have been committed in their complex, and there's some level of fear. Hence, that's why we try to create the safest environment internally. SUBTITLE: In order to improve attendance, Principal Linder created arts programs to encourage students to come to school. LINDER:  When I came here, I was a big advocate of the arts. Whole classes would just go to this one art teacher and no other arts offerings were made available. We instituted the following year where students were provided with an option to select which elective they would go to. So, to date, and we have the only marching band in district 23, we have added dancers to go along with the marching band. Broadway Jr. is like the creme de la creme of 184.  This year, we're doing Willy Wonka. So, you can see the difference. Students want to be present in school because we're rehearsing for Broadway Jr. We're performing for the Christmas showcase, right? So, I have to be present. So, we recognized by doing all of those things, it supported us with improving our attendance. Since the 10 years I've been here, we've seen sort of a roller coaster, I'll be honest, right? But we knew that we had to add and provide more. As a community school, we have a community resource director who identifies the gaps, what's not here. WARNER:  We are pretty much the hub of the community. Yeah, so when our parents are in need, they can come. LINDER:  How many parents are taking their children for exams? We're going to have the eye exams right here on site. WANDA SPEEDE, COMMUNITY RESOURCE DIRECTOR:  Today, as you can see, we had our food distribution of fresh produce, because we go into the supermarkets in the area, we will notice that there's a dearth of fresh natural foods. So, our book distribution, these are books that we've accumulated over the years, we've used them as class sets. We actually distribute those for free to families. So, we're excited that we can do this for the community. LINDER:  I will be retiring after 30 years with the New York City Department of Education. I felt like I had left an indelible impact on the school community and all the other communities I have worked in. AUBREY NICHOLSON, FORMER STUDENT:  Ms. Linder is an amazing person, and I would say that the school definitely, you know, started to thrive, I mean, when Ms. Linder got into the principal's office, definitely. MILLS:  Ms. Linder is like my second mother. ALIYAH BASKERVILLE, STUEDENT:  And thank you to Ms. Linder that she made that she's the main one who made this school and who made us feel powerful and brave. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. All of you powerful and brave people, your 10 out of 10 story today is about two friends from France who went to the World Cup in Qatar. Why? Because they traveled roughly 4,300 miles by bike. We're talking 13 countries, flooded woodlands in Hungary, a scorching desert in Saudi Arabia, dozens of flat tires. Their goal was to see their beloved team France, the defending World Cup champs. They told us, we're the kind of people that have big ideas and we don't want to have any regrets. Let's meet them. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MEHDI BALAMISSA, TEAM FRANCE FAN:  This crazy idea of going to Qatar from Paris by bicycle to attend the World Cup. GABRIEL MARTIN, TEAM FRANCE FAN:  It was under 7,000 kilometers, three months, 13 countries. We went from Paris to Istanbul. Istanbul, we went south was Jerusalem. Third of our adventure, weather in Saudi Arabia. BALAMISSA:  And we actually went through all kinds of landscapes, from Europe to the mountains of Turkey, and in the desert in the Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia. First stages in the desert were especially very hard because it's a very -- like it's such a hostile environment. And compared to what we experienced in Europe for example, there is just nothing around here. MARTIN:  We had a lot of surprises, but I think the most important but how hospitality is a world, a universal world. You know, in each country, we are received by people, giving us some food, even giving us some water, sometimes welcoming us at home. Arriving in Doha was incredible. There were so many people welcoming us especially from the French community based in Doha. We had the French national team here. They made the surprise to work on us, to take picture with us, and to offer the French national jersey with all the players signatures. BALAMSSIA:  So, we will fly back to Paris, but this doesn't mean bike trips are over the lifestyle that we actually loved, and I'm sure that we will want to go back on other adventures. We were actually very happy to document our trip and share with our followers on social media. And so, we also realized that this was a way of telling people that, look, you can take your bike and live adventures. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, lovely people. We made it. There ain't no mentum like momentum. So, let's finish this week strong and power right along into the weekend. First, though, a shout out to Lakeview Junior and Senior High School in Campti, Louisiana. Remember, you are more powerful than you know. I'm Coy. This is CNN, and it's been a blessing to spend this week with you. END221205

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. It's your boy Coy here, starting with some Monday motivation for you and me.  I challenge you to say the alphabet backwards -- Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T, S, R, Q, P, O, N, M, L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, G, A. Like that. And I want you to challenge me to work a unique word of your choice into tomorrow's show. Follow me @CoyWire on Insta, Snapchat and TikTok and put your challenge words in a comment, and I'll choose one fun one to work in tomorrow's show. All right. It's time for the best 10 minutes in news for you. CNN starts right now. We're going to start with the news out of Hawaii. On Sunday, huge amounts of lava continue to flow from the Mauna Loa volcano, the world's largest active volcano, which has been erupting for over a week now. It turns out the lava is creeping closer to a key highway that connects the east and west sides of the big islands of Hawaii. As of Saturday morning, the lava was just two and a half miles from the DKI highway. It had been moving around feet per hour over the last hours.  For now, the highway remains open and it's even attracted sightseers who have flocked the area to see the historic lava show. The volcano is erupting for the first time in almost four decades. The flow of lava is unpredictable. Its direction is expected to change hour to hour and day to day, making it difficult to estimate when or even if the lava flow will impact the highway.  In the meantime, Hawaiian officials say they have a plan to shut the highway down if the lava gets close enough to become dangerous. Now, while it may seem scary and potentially destructive, some people see it as beautiful. After all, the islands were formed as a result of volcanic eruptions. So without lava flow, there would be no Hawaii at all. CNN's David Culver is on the scene with the latest.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The nighttime glow of Mauna Loa's oozing lava -- well, you just have to pull over and properly admire it.  It's basically the middle the night and you guys are out here, why?  PIILANI ZYCH, OAHU, HAWAII RESIDENT:  Well, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to be able to experience this. And we decided to come early in the morning so we didn't have to sit in traffic.  CULVER:  Having hopped from Oahu to here, the big island, this family, three generations, came to respectfully honor the Hawaiian eruptions.  ZYCH:  It's all beautiful to us. So, we pay huge reverence to this. It's very culturally significant for us as well. So, it's a big deal.  CULVER:  A site made even more luring with the side of sunrise, which brought the crowds to old saddle road. Officials turning this stretch into a one-way street, allowing passersby the chance to stop and let the views seep in.  And that keeps drivers from pulling over and stopping on this, what is one of the main highways connecting one part of the island to the other. USGS and state officials warned, the lava flow, while slowed in recent days, is inching closer to cutting off this highway. It is within three miles now.  The other worry, not here on the ground but up in the air. What looks like plumes of smoke, experts say those are acid gases. Officials monitoring the levels, warning it could become tax toxic for residents and visitors of the big island.  Mauna Loa is the second of the big islands five volcanoes currently erupting. Kilauea is still rumbling after destroying more than 600 homes here in 2018.  But many Hawaiians see the potential path of destruction as simultaneous creation, surfacing from this, the world's largest active volcano.  And with the eruption continuing at its current pacing, officials feel like they should be able to give folks up to two days notice should the lava make its way onto that major thoroughfare cutting off that highway. But they also warn when it comes to the flow of lava, there is no forecasting. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Who conducted the first spacewalk, which took place in 1965? Alan Shepard, Yuri Gagarin, Ed White, or Alexei Leonov? While Ed White was the first American to space walk, the first to ever do it was Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  On Saturday, the International Space Station got powered up. NASA astronauts Josh Casada and Frank Rubio got suited up and floated outside the station to install a solar array or panel on the outside of the space lab. Their mission lasted seven hours. There were two solar arrays installed back in June of 2021, but now, the plan is to add a total of six more to hopefully boost the space station's power generation by more than 30 percent. The original solar arrays were only designed to last 15 years, but they've been supplying power for more than 20 years. They still work but they're definitely showing some signs of wear and tear after that long-term exposure to the environment.  When it comes to office views though, this one might be the best one in the world or the best out of this world. (MUSIC) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, a fresh look at a game of golf on the moon. Astronaut Alan Shepard will forever be remembered for becoming the first American in space in 1961. Putt in 1971, as commander of the Apollo 14 moon mission, he left viewers and even folks back at mission control stunned when he pulled out a club and ball to take a celestial swing on a fairway 230 miles away.  His moon game is now being seen in a whole new light after a NASA specialist dedicated over 10,000 hours to restoring flight film of the Apollo missions. Now here's teeing up for us right now. Roll it. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUBTITLE:  Over 50 years ago, Alan B. Shepard Jr. played a game of golf that was "out of this world".  Almost 240,000 miles away from Earth, Shepard hit two golf balls on the surface of the moon. Despite being so far away, he found a way to connect with the people back home. BRIAN ODOM, CHIEF HISTORIAN AT NASA:  I think it resonates with people because it's just a very human activity, a very, you know, a cultural thing that's taking place on the moon. So I think that's why it really resonates with folks. You can talk seismometers and all of this stuff all day long really of what they're doing on the moon, but you talk hitting a golf ball in the moon and people like, oh, yeah, right. Shepard obviously was the first American in space and he'd been grounded for a long time. So, you know, he thought he may never get to go back into space. So when he finally gets this, you know, his health works out and he gets this opportunity to go back, you can kind of see him thinking what's something fun and cool I can do to put my own stamp on this program. And, you know, sneaking things onto the capsule and hitting a golf ball, that seems to be pretty well in line with the Shepard we know. SUBTITLE:  Former property developer Andy Saunders found a new calling in enhancing poor quality NASA archive footage.  It was the lack of high-quality pictures of Neil Armstrong on the moon that started him on this path.  ANDY SAUNDERS, NASA DIGITAL RESTORATION EXPERT:  I wanted to see Neil Armstrong in the moon, he first person on another world, this monumental moment in history. Since childhood, I was obsessed with anything that could fly really from boomerangs and paper airplanes. Rockets were the ultimate, and it was also that added fascination with the moon. At one stage, I was kind of a semi-professional photographer, probably is about as serious as I got. And it's kind of uniting those two things, those two interests that led me to take on this, this particular project. SUBTITLE:  Like Armstrong, there was limited coverage of Shepard's feat, and it was Saunders' job to change that.  SAUNDERS:  They had TV footage of him swinging the club, live TV footage that was being back very, very, very low quality. But you couldn't see them and the ball disappeared off screen.  In the low res images, everything just looks like small rocks. But in a higher resolution scan, I could zoom right in, enhance it and find something which looked very much like a ball. SUBTITLE:  In February 2021, Saunders found the second golf ball and was able to accurately measure the distance traveled: 40 yards.  SAUNDERS:  When he said, oh, it's gone miles and miles and miles, I think he knew deep down that they didn't quite go that far. So 40 hours, that's terrible, but you know, they have these visors, they built your spacesuit. They could barely even see their feet. So visibility wasn't very good because of the restrictive suit, he had to hit it one-handed.  So to even make contact I think was pretty, pretty impressive. SUBTITLE:  Why do Shepard's actions resonate so much? ODOM:  It's the human side of this. It's, you know, that's the thing we can't forget. When it comes to a human activity, something that's done just for the joy of being alive, that's something that people can appreciate. SAUNDERS:  You know, a lot of people know that someone play golf on the moon but not a lot of those people would know that it was on Apollo 14. That there was even wasn't Apollo 14. So, you know, those human moments resonate forever, and that -- and that's one of the few. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  That's all we have time for, for now. We hope that that story helped to capture your i-moon-gination in this marvelous Monday.  Our shout-out today goes to a school of innovation. The Franklin School of Innovation in Asheville, North Carolina.  Our goal is to shout out all of your schools lunar than later. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire and this is CNN 10. END221206

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. As the ancient philosopher Confucius once said, we have two lives and the second begins when we realize we only have one. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. With just 86,400 seconds in this day, let's get going and let's make the most of them. We're going to begin with the latest out of Indonesia where Mount Semeru, a very active volcano, erupted on Sunday, blanketing roads and homes in volcanic ash and promoting evacuations of nearly 2,000 residents in the East Java province. The volcano spewed thick columns of ash, nearly 5,000 feet into the sky and as far as 7.4 miles away. Villages and nearby towns blanketed with falling ash, blocking out the sun but thankfully no casualties have been reported. On Monday, improved weather conditions allowed rescuers to resume evacuation efforts in a search for possible victims. The area of eruption is the most densely populated island in Indonesia, nearly 2,000 people escaped to emergency shelters at several schools. Indonesia's officials warned residents to stay at least miles away from the volcano's eruption center. But many felt they had to return to their homes Monday to protect their property. The eruption in East Java on Sunday following a series of earthquakes on the west of the island, including one last month that killed more than 300 people, and many residents are still traumatized after more than 50 people were killed, and thousands more displaced when the same volcano erupted just last year. We'll continue to follow this story as well as the Mauna Loa volcano eruption in Hawaii. Let's hear more now from my friend, CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice-over):  Ash fills the skies in Indonesia, forming a thick caustic cloud over Mount Semeru on the island of Java. Video from the country's ministry of environment and forestry captured the explosive eruption on Saturday a burst of ash shooting 15 kilometers into the sky, a sign for people living in the volcano's shadow it's time to go. This man, escaping on a motorbike, the ash caking on his face. He says he doesn't know where he's going just somewhere out of the volcano's reach. Authorities say nearly 2,000 people have been evacuated from the slopes of the volcano which is located about kilometers southeast of Jakarta. The roads in the area are packed with vehicles rushing to outrun the volcanic ash that is still raining down. Emergency workers are directing people out of the danger zone, handing out masks and urging them to go to shelters. INDAH AMPERAWATI MASDAR, LUMAJANG DISTRICT DEPUTY CHIEF (through translator):  We have readied some nearby schools and village halls. We will prepare them until the observatory post declares it's safe. CHINCHAR:  The damage has already been done to some areas. Rooftops are singed and the ground is covered with smoldering soot. Authorities are telling people to stay at least eight kilometers away from the eruption center, but there are fears the hot ash could drift further. So far, many people are heeding the warnings, a lesson learned last year when more than people were killed in a previous eruption and thousands were forced from their homes. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which U.S. state nickname was inspired by the sticky sap of its pine trees? California, Montana, North Carolina, or Alaska? With vast pine tree forests, North Carolina is nicknamed the Tar Heel State. Power outages in North Carolina are causing so much concern that the FBI is investigating. Officials believe intentional attacks on substations are causing power outages in Moore County near Fayetteville. But at this time, they haven't named any suspects or even motives. Forty thousand customers were in the dark as of Sunday. The investigation turned into a criminal investigation when utility crews found signs of potential vandalism to equipment at several different sites, including two substations that were damaged by gunfire. We're talking millions of dollars in estimated damage. In order to protect residents, property, businesses and public services, the authorities announced a mandatory curfew from 9:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m. in the county. The curfew which started Sunday will continue nightly until there's an emergency declaration. This outage is impacting the community in all sorts of ways as you can imagine. All schools in the county were closed on Monday. There was no church on Sunday. Traffic lights are out. Many businesses are closed, with a few stores using generators to open their doors. Authorities opened a shelter which is running on a generator. According to local officials, the damage is significant and rerouting power just isn't an option. As of Monday, an FBI manhunt was underway. But whoever is responsible remains a mystery to the community. We'll keep you updated in the coming days right here on CNN 10. Next up, CNN business producer Jon Sarlin is introducing us to BlocPower, one of a handful of companies looking to make clean energy affordable for everyone. The Brooklyn, New York-based business wants to help companies prioritize helping the climate, while also lowering utility bills and saving money. The company also targets dense and low-income neighborhoods where significant cost savings can help the most. They've reached nearly 1,200 buildings in New York so far. Let's learn more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JON SARLIN, CNN BUSINESS PRODUCER:  From eating locally to buying an electric car, being eco-friendly can be expensive especially when it comes to making our homes greener. In 2020, residential and commercial buildings accounted for 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. But the cost of buying and installing green technology can cost tens of thousands of dollars. DONNEL BAIRD, CEO, BLOCPOWER:  Greening buildings can be really difficult, complicated and hard and a little scary and expensive. SARLIN:  But what if it wasn't expensive, and you could make your building green without paying any upfront costs. A company called BlocPower is one of a handful of companies trying to make that possible. BAIRD:  Our job is, okay, how do we make clean energy affordable for everyone? A lot of building owners and property managers might not care about climate change as their top priority, but they definitely care about reducing their costs because that's money that can go in their pocket. SARLIN:  BlocPower leases and installs equipment like solar panels and heat pumps, energy efficient devices that both heat and cool buildings and use about 50 percent less energy than furnaces or baseboard heaters, all of which means lower bills. According to BlocPower, installing a heat pump can lower utility bills between 20 and 70 percent a year, the company is able to make back its money over time by taking a portion of the building's savings. LINCOLN ECCLES, BUILDING OWNER:  It looks very clean and very sleek. I like I like how you guys did this. This system it's quiet, it's clean. I've literally had tenants come up to me and tell me that they see a real savings in their actual electricity use. NOAH, BROOKLYN RESIDENT:  Right, so that we had a radiator system, the radiator was either just hot, extremely hot or non-existent, so my bill has significantly been a lot cheaper. SARLIN:  Greening buildings has become more competitive with companies like Sealed also offering retrofits with no upfront costs. BlocPower says it prioritizes greening dense, low and moderate-income neighborhoods where buildings are often outdated, and cost savings are needed most. BAIRD:  I grew up in a low-income apartment building. All the buildings were overheated. The tenants had opened up all the windows and we're burning energy that was like floating out of the window. And so, I was like man, there's a massive problem here. SARLIN:  Since 2004, Brooklyn-based BlocPower has upgraded over 1,200 buildings in New York, and they're partnering with cities around the country to help them hit carbon goals. With investment from the Bezos Earth Fund, they're currently building proprietary software that they say will help them identify greening opportunities for millions of buildings. BAIRD:  The most rewarding part of working at BlocPower for me is I'll be able to look my kids in the eye and say I did everything I could to prevent the climate disaster. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's 10 out of 10, an Illinois 8th grade hooper hitting legendary status with an epic buzzer beater. Milton Pope down just one with just seconds to go and the opponent misses a free throw, but Cooper Thorson snags the rebound dribbles around, he heaves it, and you better believe it. Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Cooper hitting the nearly full court shot but dropping it like it's hot. The whole moment was caught on camera, creating the perfect viral moment. CNN highlight reel. Take that chef Steph Curry, this is Cooper's kitchen. And that kid is eaten. And now on to our favorite part of the day, I want to give a special shout out to Foxboro High School in Foxboro, Massachusetts. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one, going out and make someone smile today. Remember that kindness is not what you do, but who you are.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. I'm Coy Wire, ready to make this a wonderful Wednesday with you. But before, I start I must say I am bumfuzzled by the amount of creativity and passion with which you accepted my challenge to pick a word for me to work into yesterday's show. It was supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, if you didn't notice. And don't worry, I'll challenge you to another one next week. We start today with the latest on the economy. If you've watched the news in the last few months, it's likely you've seen concerns from consumers and experts about the economy or headlines featuring layoffs especially in the tech industry. However, this month, the economy showed a continued demand for workers, and new jobs were added to the market. This is despite the Federal Reserve's push to curb inflation which was predicted to impact the economy and the job market. Let's break it down by the numbers. Employers added 263,000 jobs this month. That's only a slight drop from 284,000 added in October and the unemployment rate was unchanged this month at 3.7 percent. We'll bring you now to Christine Romans, CNN chief business correspondent and anchor of "EARLY START" who will tell us more about the state of the economy and consumer concerns. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Behind all those headlines of tech layoffs, sour consumer confidence, inflation anxiety, it's an economy showing resilience. Surprising strength in the economy in the third quarter, 2.9 percent annual growth from July through September, a sharp bounce back from a contraction in the first half of the year -- you know, it's a pace that would have been considered very strong before the pandemic.  The job market remains strong, too. Another 263,000 jobs added in November. It's the fewest in months but it's more than economist forecast.  This year, a stunning 4.2 million jobs added. Stripping out the pandemic, it's the most jobs added in years. And inflation, while still too hot, is showing signs of cooling.  The fed's favorite inflation gauge, the PCE price index showing signs of peaking, and gas prices are falling. They're below where they were when Russia invaded Ukraine.  Call it the yes-but economy. Yes, consumers feel like the economy is bad, but they keep spending. After all, it was a record Thanksgiving shopping season. So, why the foul mood and the sometimes conflicting headlines?  Well, COVID broke the economy and putting it back together has been hard to measure. Remember tens of millions of jobs were lost overnight, schools closed, factories shuttered, more than a million lives lost. More than two years later, we're still struggling to gauge the strength and durability of the recovery. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia, which of these animals is part of the Canidae family? Grizzly bear, golden retriever, gopher, or goldfish? Often referred to as canines, dogs, including golden retrievers, are part of the Canidae family. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Up next, we're introducing you to a very special organization called Canine Companions. They're the oldest and largest organization in the U.S. that provides service dogs. They provide service dogs for children and adults with a wide range of needs, including both physical and emotional support. These pups are uplifting and they're pretty doggone cute, too. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELINDA SOWERS, VP, CANINE TRAINING AND CLIENT SERVICES, CANINE COMPANIES:  We're in Orlando, Florida. We are at the southeast region campus of Canine Companions. We are the largest and oldest organization that provides service dogs for children, adults and veterans with disabilities. And we work really hard to transform lives. At Canine Companions, we offer several different types of dogs. One of the types of dogs that we offer is a service dog. The service dog works with someone to mitigate their disability. They can pick up items, open and close doors, drawers, refrigerators. The dogs can know over 40 commands. We want the dogs to love the work they do. SUBTITLE:  Canine Companions places dogs who can help with more disabilities, PTSD, emotional support and physical therapy. SOWERS:  Since 1975, we've placed over dogs. We currently have over 2,600 graduates that are out there working with service dogs to our organization, and over 1,400 puppy raisers who are raising puppies for us. SUBTITLE: Dogs are trained from puppyhood for over two years before being placed with people in need. The service animals are matched with their new recipients during a process called "team training".  SOWERS:  Team training is just a magical time.  It's for so many of them, the moment that they have been waiting for.  IZZY & ALANA SHERMAN, CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA:  So, we applied I want to say a year and a half ago. We just knew that this was the right thing because as he's been in and out of hospitals because of brain cancer, and all the facilities we've been in have therapy dogs and they just bring so much joy to the kids. The ability to give her not only a companion but a skilled companion that can help with some of the challenges that we face daily. SUBTITLE:  Canine Companions breeds Labrador and golden retrievers for their temperament and work ethic.  SOWERS:  We provide all of our dogs free of charge just thanks to amazing donations.  SHERMAN:  I mean our medical bills are quite high. So it's really a gift to our family. SOWERS:  We want to make sure that anybody who needs a service dog or a facility dog is able to get one. SUBTITLE:  To increase their supply of service dogs, Canine Companions partners with Duke University's "Puppy Kindergarten," a program designed to identify strong service dog candidates.  Aurora attended Duke Puppy Kindergarten before finishing her training at Canine Companions.  SOWERS:  And then at the end of that team training class, they'll have a graduation ceremony where they will graduate and go home. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Today is Canine Companions national graduation day. Instead of a diploma, our graduates today will be handed a leash. SHERMAN:  You know, it isn't the unknown. And the unknown brings questions. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Congratulations. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, we're going to meet a voice that might be familiar to you if you've ever been on TikTok. I was pretty blown away actually when I found out this voice was actually a person and not a computer.  Let's meet Kat Callaghan, the real life woman behind TikTok's text to speech feature and one of the most popular influencers online. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAT CALLAGHAN, VOICE OVER ARTIST:  Songs that made artists famous.  If you have an air fryer, you need to try this. Would you sit in this seat? My name is Kat. I work with TikTok on TTS and other projects. You're probably sick of my voice. I am sick of my voice. SUBTITLE:  Kat Callaghan, the voice behind TikTok's "Jessie" text-to-speech feature, recently revealed herself on her TikTok account. CALLAGHAN:  I understand people are a little bit freaked out that have never heard my voice before in association with a human being. I've had interviews for the last several weeks with people going, okay, I can't -- I can't look at you, because I think you should say, I can't look at you when you're talking. And you don't hear it in my regular voice all the time but once I hit that upper inflection, you know you can hear it. SUBTITLE:  Callaghan, a radio host in Canada, is still getting used to the fact that her voice is TikTok famous.  CALLAGHAN:  People are recognizing me as the voice of TikTok, and also as a radio person. I was walking down the street and a car stopped and said, "Voice of Kat", which is my which is my TikTok handle is "Voice of Kat". And I'm just like, oh, yes, hello. SUBTITLE:  However, reactions from the revelation haven't been entirely positive, with users mocking Jessie's text-to-speech feature limitations.  CALLAGHAN:  The way I say law. Definitely not a perfect technology. I'd like to have fun with the fact though that Jesse mispronounces words.  Why do you say emoji like emoji? It's one of the funniest things to be honest with you is people commenting, say this, say that, or why do you pronounce it this way? So I plan to just continue to have a little bit of fun with that. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. We are so grateful to spend part of our day with you. To get your shout out, remember to subscribe to our YouTube Channel CNN 10, and leave a comment with your school, name, city, state and mascot, and the pronunciation if necessary. Chandler Academy in Charleston, West Virginia, thank you for showing the love. We're showing it right back at you. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire and this is CNN 10. END221208

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. It's Thursday. So happy Friday eve. It's your boy Coy, Mr. Clean, but I keep it cleaner. Let's keep crushing it this week each day aiming to be a little better than the day before. This is CNN and it's time to fuel our minds. We start with an update. China is scrapping some of its most controversial COVID rules, moving away from their strict zero COVID policy which have caused people mental and emotional stress and strain. Earlier this month, protesters took to the streets in a rare display of defiance against the country's ruling communist party. The people are reeling from the effects of the government placing millions of people under lockdown and limiting access to loved ones, food and even medicine. All this on top of the economic strain it's caused. China's zero COVID policy has kept the nation's infection rate lower than countries like the United States by isolating every case of COVID and shutting down the surrounding areas. But easing restrictions now marks a significant step in the government's plans to reopen the country. This week, the Chinese government announced 10 new guidelines that loosened restrictions, most notably allowing people with COVID to quarantine at home instead of being taken to an isolation facility, a practice which previously frightened its citizens. The government is also dropping mandates that required proof of a negative COVID test to enter public places. These are some of the significant steps which should offer relief to China's residents after nearly three years of disruption to their daily lives and economic futures. But there's still concern. Twenty-five million people in China have not received a coronavirus vaccine. If there's an influx of new cases, it could overwhelm the hospital system, leading to a potentially tragic situation for citizens. Our Selina Wang has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  This is the kind of line Beijingers stand in, outside in the cold to get their COVID tests. A 48-  hour test is required to get into most places. But there aren't many places to go. Much of Beijing is still closed down. This is one of the most popular tourist places in the city. But the restaurants are largely closed, and the malls are pretty empty. So, this McDonald's is still open but for takeaway only. But even to get takeaway, you've got to prove that you're clear of COVID. Here's how I do it. I open up the health app on my smartphone, I scan the QR code. So, it says, I've got a green code, and I've got a recent COVID test, so I'm good to go. This code dictates all of our daily lives in China. Green means good to go. Red means I may have to isolate at home or go to a mass quarantine facility. This allows China to track the movements of virtually all 1.4 billion people in the name of contact tracing. I've got to scan my code to get into a taxi, a public park, a mall, or a coffee shop. Even a public bathroom. (voice-over):  I ran into a group of delivery people on the street. They've got to do COVID tests every single day to do their jobs. This woman tells me the pandemic has been hard on her. I ask her why. She says it's because she's scared of the virus. Getting COVID in China is unlike anywhere else in the world. You and your close contacts all get sent to a quarantine center. This is a convention center in Beijing that's been turned into a massive quarantine facility with thousands of beds. But some of these facilities in the country, they are in very run-down and unsanitary condition. And then your whole building or community could go into lockdown. I spoke to a man who's been in and out of quarantine six times already just this year. He tells me his whole building of more than 200 families went to a quarantine facility last month, because they were considered close contacts. He says he's not scared to get COVID because omicron is less severe and his whole family has been vaccinated. I approached a few people just released from this mass quarantine center here. I ask if they had tested positive for COVID. Yes, the man nods and says they have recovered. "How many days did you spend in there?" I asked. "Seven days," he said. Unprecedented protests recently erupted across China. They are chanting that they don't want COVID tests, they want freedom. Authorities swiftly cracked down on the protesters. But they are finally softening their stance on zero COVID. Some cities are lifting lockdowns, changing COVID testing requirements. Under some conditions, people can now quarantine at home if they have COVID, which is a huge deal. But this country has already built up a whole infrastructure around zero COVID, spending all of its resources on quarantine facilities and COVID testing. So it's going to be a long and slow exit from zero COVID. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In the animal kingdom, oysters are classified under what phylum? Mollusca, arthropoda, chordata or porifera? Oysters are soft-bodied invertebrates belonging to the phylum mollusca. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Did you know that scientists estimate that oysters have been around for 15 million years and they're far more valuable than the beautiful pearls that they can produce. The reefs that take shape as they grow together create a shelter where hundreds of other species can flourish. They're also crucial for ocean health, filtering the water around them. One oyster can filter gallons of water per day. Let's hear now from conservationists who are hoping to be successful in restoring Hong Kong's famous oyster reefs in CNN's Call to Earth. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Tucked away in the northwest corner of Hong Kong with the high-tech Chinese mega city of Shenzhen in sight is a rich habitat that is home to mangroves, soft, muddy shores and oyster reefs that date back centuries. For over 700 years local farmers cultivated oysters here in the mud flats of Pak Nai and recent decades, traditional oyster farming has declined due in part to coastal reclamation and over harvesting. But conservationists like Marine Thomas have discovered that reintroducing oysters to the abandoned reefs can boost biodiversity and strengthen these shores. MARINE THOMAS, SENIOR CONSERVATION PROGRAM MANAGER, THE NATURE CONSERVANCY:  Usually, people will associate oysters with food but less known is that oysters and other shellfish create habitats. They create reef habitats. In fact, just like coral reefs, they will bunch together and create these hard structures that you can actually walk on. STOUT:  In a survey of the city's coastlines, researchers from the Nature Conservancy at the University of Hong Kong discovered existing reefs like these old farms could potentially act as a source of oyster larvae. They also found that a single Hong Kong oyster can filter up to 30 liters or 8 gallons of water an hour, one of the highest filtration rates recorded for the species. Another finding, the reefs host six times more species and bare mud flats as the piles of shells provide shelter for worms and small crabs, attracting a variety of animals including birds like this little egret. And yet another benefit is mitigating the effects of climate change, so how does the humble oyster do that? THOMAS:  So the humble oyster will also help us fight climate change if it's in a reef structure so if it's in a hard reef structure that is creating a barrier, think of it as a natural sea wall then it's going to be creating friction on the sea bottom that will attenuate wave action and therefore also flooding at the back of it. STOUT:  Since 2020, Thomas and a team of volunteers have been at work restoring this abandoned oyster farm. They dry old shells in the sun before returning them to the water to form a base for oyster larva to attach to. They hope to introduce millions of oysters to help revitalize the area over the next few years. ASHLEY HEMRAJ, MARINE BIOLOGIST, THE SWIRE INSTITUTE OF MARINE SCIENCE, THE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG:  One of the biggest things that always amazes me and makes me happy is seeing all the number of crabs here, especially here as you walk, the crab walks away. It's -- if you fix on it, it's quite amazing to see this. It is really, really beautiful. STOUT:  As new oysters grow, they clean the water, provide shelter and food for wildlife and join forces with the mangroves as a coastal buffer. A spectacular sunset descends on Pak Nai as these small briny creatures work to build an ever more vibrant ecosystem. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, if you're a jogger and you're claustrophobic, this race is not for you. Hundreds of jolly old joggers in a Santa run in Michendorf, Germany, jingling all the way, dressed in red from head to mistletoe, look at all those Santas go. Talk about spreading Christmas cheer, this is the 14th annual race. One Santa said that even if you finish last, it's being there that counts. They ran in near freezing temperatures, maybe getting fit to deliver those gifts, Santa even without his sleigh still slays. It's slay-NN 10, the most wonderful time of the year and the most wonderful part of this show: you. Special shout out to all the teachers today. Keep up lifting, informing and inspiring students. Going up and dap your teacher up give them a handshake or a high five. Let them know that you appreciate them. Also getting a shout out, Holdrege Middle School in Holdrege, Nebraska. Keep shining. I'm Coy Wire. I'm headed to Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love. So I'll see you from there tomorrow. END221209

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people, and welcome to the city of Brotherly Love, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, my home state. I'm standing in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and you may recognize those steps, the iconic rocky steps. We're here for one of the greatest rivalries in all of sports. Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. Eastern, it's the 123rd edition of the Army-Navy football game and it's so much more than a game. Dating back to 1890, the traditions, pageantry, passion and respect make the Army-Navy game the greatest rivalry in American sports. The game is so big, 10 sitting U.S. presidents have attended, from Theodore Roosevelt in 1901, to Donald Trump two years ago. It is humbling to watch this rivalry. It's said that this is a game where everyone playing is willing to die for everyone watching. That's powerful stuff. This is America's game. If only all of us could have the perspective of these individuals representing the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York. They stand their ground against the opposing side, but afterwards, they walk across the field and embrace each other as brothers and sisters because they never forget that in the end, they're all on the same team. But don't get me wrong they play hard for bragging rights that'll last a lifetime. Navy leads the series 62-53-7 all time and to paraphrase the 34th president of the United States Dwight Eisenhower, the Army and Navy are the best of friends 364-1/2 days out of the year. But on this one Saturday afternoon, they are the worst of enemies. The rivalry is also loaded with traditions, like when Army West Point's marathon team runs the ball about 150 miles through the night and through the elements, from West Point to Philly. There's also a flyover before the game during the national anthem, and there isn't a dry eye in the stadium. Later on in the show, I'll tell you about some of the fun pranks associated with the rivalry. But first let's take a look at some of the headlines of today. WNBA star Brittney Griner was released from a Russian prison yesterday. In February, she was arrested on drug smuggling charges when traveling through the Moscow airport. In August, she was sentenced to nine years in a Russian prison. Griner's release on Thursday was part of a prisoner swap between Russia and the United States. A convicted Russian arms dealer Victor Bout was released from a U.S. prison. He was previously sentenced to 25 years on charges of conspiring to kill Americans and providing weapons to terrorist organizations. The swap did not include another American that the state department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whalen. Here's what President Biden had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We never forgot about Brittney. We've not forgotten about Paul Whelan who's been unjustly detained in Russia for years. This was not a choice of which American to bring home. We brought home Trevor Reed when we had a chance early this year. Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul's case differently than Brittney's. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul's release, we are not giving up. We will never give up. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next up, scientists say they have now confirmed why we get more colds in the wintertime, and they say it's a major breakthrough. According to a recent study, it turns out that the cold air damages the immune response occurring in our noses. When we're exposed to cold air the temperature in our nose can drop by as much as 9 degrees Fahrenheit and that kills nearly percent of the billions of virus and bacteria fighting cells in our nostrils. It's enough to essentially knock out all of the immune advantages that our nose has to offer. More research is needed to understand how this research could be used to prevent illness in the future. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these prehistoric animals was a marine reptile? Allosaurus, Plesiosaur, Diplodocus or ankylosaurus? While the others on this list were all land dinosaurs, the plesiosaur was a marine reptile and an intact skeleton of one was just discovered in Australia. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUBTITLE:  This 100-million-year-old intact plesiosaur skeleton was discovered in Queensland, Australia. Amateur paleontologists known as the "Rock Chicks" uncovered the remains of the 19-foot-tall reptile in August. Researchers say the finding may provide vital clues about prehistoric life. DR. ESPEN KNUTSEN, SENIOR CURATOR OF PALEONTOLOGY, QUEENSLAND MUSEUM:  So, usually, what we find is that when we're digging these things out of the ground is that we'll find bits of the body, no head, and very, very rarely, we'll find just ahead, but unfortunately with no body attached. So the fact that this guy had both allows us to close that gap where they have this overlap between the body and the head that will unravel a lot of the species diversity, of how many species of these long neck pieces also swimming around here in this outback ocean 100 million years ago. SUBTITLE:  Plesiosaurs are not classified as dinosaurs as they did not have gills and had to surface to breathe. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Okay. Now to those pranks I was telling you about. As I mentioned at the top of the show, there's so much tradition associated with the Army-  Navy game but some of it is all in good fun. Exhibit A, this year, Navy flew over the Army's campus and dropped a bunch of ping pong balls that said, go Navy, beat Army. But every year, the Navy has to protect their beloved mascots, their goats, because the Army tries to steal them. A while back I got to interview the goats and their protectors. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Preparations for the Army-Navy game can be intense. You have the game plan, the playbooks and the practices. But perhaps one of the most important facets of pre-game preparations here in Annapolis has nothing to do with the players, but rather mascots, goats, and more specifically protecting the goats. Can you tell us where you keep the goats? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I can't tell you that.. WIRE:  We won't tell anyone. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, afraid I can't do that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We don't want Army to come and steal it, like we know they're not capable of doing it, but just for a precaution measures. WIRE:  So, we're talking maybe confidential, secret or the location of the goats. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Above top secret. So, we're -- this is a whole separate classification. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They're kept at a pretty secure location though. They have a guard dog. WIRE:  So, there is a guard dog? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There is, and he is massive and scary. WIRE:  You think if I ask a goat, maybe they would tell me where they're kept. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You could definitely try but they've been briefed heavily, and let's just say they probably won't give you anything either. WIRE:  Can you tell us where your hideout is? Are you aware of the Army's hype video that they released? It alludes to an elaborate plot to steal the goats this year. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Confirm the role of Billy the Goat is the head of Navy spirit group. WIRE:  Does it make you nervous? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It does not. I've seen our security measures and especially the dog once again is I don't think anyone could get past him. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We feel the goods are pretty secure, and not many people know their location, and even if they did, they'd have a hard time stealing them. UNIDENTIFIED MALES:  Fear the goats, beat the Army. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. For today's 10 out of 10, the Oxford Dictionary just announced their word of the year. Drum roll, please. It's -- wait, what? The word is goblin mode, technically two words. It's a slang term that became popular during the pandemic, and it means someone that is unapologetically self-indulgent and loves being lazy. This way of life rejects all social expectations. Yeah. I know, we're not talking about anyone in this group, right? Yeah, sure. All right. We are going to switch from goblin mode to beast mode. All right, being that we're at one of the most popular tourist destinations in all of Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, you know I had to take you on a run with me up the iconic Rocky steps from the 1976 film "Rocky". Thousands of people flock to these steps every year to mimic one of the most famous movie scenes in the world. Rocky Balboa finishing a morning run at the top of these steps, a symbol for all the underdogs out there. Now, we're going to give a special shout out to New Hope Middle School in Columbus, Mississippi. Rise up. And for all of you underdogs out there, keep working everyone every single day. Keep believing in yourself, so that you can make your dreams come true, too. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. Yo, Adrian! END221212

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone.  I'm Coy Wire, and welcome to a special edition of CNN 10. You likely don't know this but the program you're watching right now started all the way back in 1989 when CNN launched a news program designed for the classroom. And today, we're going to look back at one of the most influential stories from that year. It involves protests in China's Tiananmen square that changed the course of history. Tiananmen Square is located in the center of the Chinese Capital of Beijing. In 1989, after several weeks of demonstrations by students and other citizens calling for a more Democratic government, Chinese troops entered the square on June 4th and fired on civilians. It's estimated that several hundred to thousands were killed, and as many as 10,000 people were arrested. Accounts of the massacre are still censored in China today. We now have a special report of CNN's coverage from on the ground that year and as you'll see after the Chinese government pulled the plug on the broadcast, CNN had to report by telephone and use video that was snuck out of the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NARRATOR:  Fifteen years ago, China was still almost totally isolated from the rest of the world. Today, the encouragement of private enterprise, free markets, foreign investment, and the introduction of western products and ideas has made this country the pioneer in the communist world search for reform. But now, China's reform program has run into trouble. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Inflation officially has been at the 20 percent level in recent months. Corruption has grown a great deal. NARRATOR:  These dislocations caused by an economy that is only half reformed, neither communist nor capitalist, have generated widespread public discontent. SUBTITLE:  CNN was in Beijing as public discontent led to demonstrations and one of the darkest moments in China's history. NARRATOR:  In the dead of night, 2,000 students marched through the streets of Beijing, calling for democracy human rights and the resignation of the Chinese government. Their destination: Tiananmen Square in the city center. SUBTITLE:  Tiananmen Square is the government's ceremonial center and one of the largest plazas in the world. NARRATOR:  It was here that the students placed a huge banner honoring the memory of Hu Yaobang, who died on Saturday in political disgrace purged by communist party hardliners two and a half years ago for his liberal views. To the students however, Hu represented hope for reform and change, hopes that to many Chinese have been dashed by recent government efforts to scale back economic and political liberalization. There has never been a challenge to the leadership of communist China like this one. In cities all across the country, crowds taking to the streets to demand democracy and freedom. In commemorating Hu's death by demanding the implementation of the progressive policies he advocated, the students have put the government on the defensive, most notably by using tactics such as the peaceful sit-in that the authorities here have never seen. PROTESTERS:  Long live freedom! Long live freedom! Punish corrupt officials! Punish corrupt officials! Freedom of the speech! Freedom of the speech! SUBTITLE:  Chinese leadership was divided on how to respond and attempted to limit the public's awareness of the demonstrations. However, some journalists were sympathetic to the demonstrators. NARRATOR:  The students got a big boost when several official Chinese newspapers defied government orders and published accurate accounts of the events of the past week. SUBTITLE:  As public support grew; student activists encouraged the general population to join the call for reform. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  If you're going to have a student movement, you must seek support from the workers and peasants. Only if they understand can we succeed. NARRATOR:  Again and again, the badly outnumbered police were overwhelmed and pushed aside. SUBTITLE:  On May 4th, nineteen days after the protests began, tens of thousands of demonstrators converged on Tiananmen Square. May 4th was the anniversary of the 1919 student movement that led to the communist revolution. REPORTER:  This was the demonstrator's destination, Tiananmen Square, the heart of Beijing, the seat of the government. NARRATOR:  The scene at Tiananmen showed the depth of public discontent here now, over inflation, corruption and the lack of political freedom. SUBTITLE:  One month into the demonstrations, The students sang the Internationale, the international communist anthem. NARRATOR:  On the eve of Mikhail Gorbachev's visit, China's rebellious students up the stakes in their confrontation with the government, adopting a new set of tactics to force a faster pace of reform. Two hundred students started a hunger strike, marching through Beijing to downtown Tiananmen Square, vowing to stay without food until the authorities agreed to recognize their illegal students' federation. SUBTITLE:  China's leaders were scheduled to meet in Beijing with Mikhail Gorbachev to mend years of strife between the communist republics. NARRATOR:  With Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union's pioneer of political reform due here on Monday, no one in the Chinese leadership wants him to have a reception like this. SUBTITLE:  The number of hunger strikers quickly grew. REPORTER:  This is now the third day in which about a thousand students have been carrying out a hunger strike to press their demands for democracy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Gorbachev's reforms have been extremely successful. So we hope his visit will help accelerate political reform in China. NARRATOR:  A growing number of those in the square are not students but journalists professional people and especially workers impatient for change. For China's leaders, there could not be a more embarrassing or frightening set of circumstances. BERNARD SHAW, CNN ANCHOR:  Now some thoughts, I came to cover a summit. I walked into a revolution, a massively peaceful statement by the people but still a revolution. SUBTITLE:  By May 19, an estimated 1.2 million demonstrators had gathered in Tiananmen Square. NARRATOR:  Huge crowds again serves through the center of Beijing, people from all walks of life, workers, taxi drivers, shopkeepers, even some peasants from the countryside while lending their support to the hunger striker's demand for freedom and democracy. At the same time, over a hundred thousand people demonstrated in Shanghai where 300 students had begun their own hunger strike. SUBTITLE:  Government leaders visited the students to ask them to end their hunger strike. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You have every right to criticize us. I'm also not here to ask for your forgiveness this time. NARRATOR:  Communist Party Chief Zhao and Premier Li visiting Tiananmen Square to appeal for an end to the student hunger strike. Late in the evening, Premier Li appeared on nationwide television to announce that the situation was out of control and that the army was being called in to restore orders. LI PENG, PREMIER OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (through translator):  The situation in Beijing is getting worse and it is going to bring out a nationwide riot if we don't really do anything to crack to stop this situation. NARRATOR:  Communist Party Chief Zhao, a liberal who had sympathized with the students, being enforced to resign. REPORTER:  There is word authorities decided he had to go because he refused to agree to use force against the students. LI:  For a month, the government has taken very calm and tolerant attitude towards the students' demonstration. We did this because we love our students. SUBTITLE:  Premier Li Peng claimed that the students were under the influence of a few troublemakers, and those on hunger strike were 'hostages". The People's Liberation Army was ordered in to clear the square. REPORTER:  Masters of demonstrators marched out of Beijing and rode in cars to the west. Before dawn, more than one hundred thousand were on the outskirts of the city, taking the confrontation to the troops, not waiting for the army to reach town. SHAW:  The People's Liberation Army blocked by the people. The troops cannot move to clear Tiananmen Square. ANNOUNCER:  This is CNN's Prime News. And in Beijing, Bernard Shaw. SHAW:  Let's go quickly to Jeanne Moos in Tiananmen Square -- Jeanne. JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Bernie, we don't have any real hard information down here. The same announcement keeps coming over the PA system. It's an official announcement signed by the premier of China, according to the announcer. And it talks about martial law being imposed here in Tiananmen Square. It was a night of tension, a break of celebration in the morning of uncertainty. SHAW:  Jeanne, Jeanne? MOOS:  Yes, Bernie? SHAW:  I'm being told that the government officials are coming into the CNN control room now. This man with a piece of paper in his hand. I'm certain that is not a party invitation. Okay, let me quickly tell you what this official is saying: if you do not obey the orders, you will not be allowed to come home. This official on the right side of your right side of your screen saying to CNN, if you do not obey the -- NARRATOR:  The Chinese government ordered all foreign media to stop broadcasting. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You have him call us properly and explain to us what is happening here. If you cannot give us an explanation. UNIDENTIIFIED MALE:  Moment, please? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Fine. SHAW:  We're told that President George Herbert Walker Bush is watching what's happening. President Bush is saying, quote, word of the news blackout is very disturbing. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our government led me to tell you now stop your transmission. SHAW:  These characters being written on this legal pad in effect are saying that this government is telling CNN to end its transmission. (END VIDEOTAPE) END221213

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. We have a rendezvous with the news. I'm back from Philly, feeling refreshed, ready to crush this week with you. We start with a rocket ship returned. After a 25-1/2-day mission around the moon, NASA's historic Artemis I mission made a successful splashdown on Sunday. The uncrewed test flight was meant to pave the way for future missions, which could take astronauts back to the moon, The Orion spacecraft pulled off a record-breaking mission including two lunar flybys, one with an 80-miles of the lunar surface, more than 1.4 million miles traveled in all before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean, just west of Baja, California. After landing, the capsule spent six hours in the ocean with NASA collecting additional data and running some tests before the rescue team moved it, a fleet of recovery vehicles were waiting nearby. The landing was key to making sure that the Orion spacecraft is ready to fly real astronauts next time and then eventually to Mars. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  And here we go, the lead-up to the Artemis I launch might have been a bumpy ride after a series of delays due to technical glitches and bad weather, but NASA says once its mega rocket got off the ground it's being smooth sailing. MIKE SARAFIN, ARTEMIS MISSION MANAGER:  We got to witness the world's most powerful rocket take the Earth by its edges and shake the wicked out of it, and it was quite a sight. BLACK:  After three and a half weeks in space filled with engine burns, lunar flybys and stunning views of the earth and the moon, NASA's Orion spacecraft is home. But before it's splashed down a critical test, in one of the most nail-biting times of the re-entry process, the Orion capsule will separate from its service module then complete a skip maneuver off the edge of the Earth's atmosphere, which will bring it closer to its landing site and cut down on the G-forces that future astronauts will have to endure. After that, all eyes are on the heat shield as Orion blazes back to earth at temperatures twice as hot as molten lava. NASA says the heat shield has been tested more than a thousand times and making sure it can take the heat is one of the primary goals of this mission. From the outset, the uncrewed Artemis I mission has been a dry run to make sure the spacecraft is safe enough for astronauts to fly on board. BILL NELSON, NASA ADMINISTRATOR:  We are stressing it and testing it in ways that we will not do to a rocket that has a human crew on it. BLACK:  If Artemis I is a success, it will be followed by Artemis II, which like the first mission will fly around the moon, but this time with a crew. That will be followed by Artemis III, which intends to return astronauts to the moon's surface, including the first woman and person of color. Later missions will aim even further with the goal of sending astronauts to Mars. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE (voice-over):  Ten-second trivia: The equator runs directly through which of these countries? Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria or Ethiopia? All of these countries are close to the equator but only Kenya is crossed by it. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  We have introduced you to several of our CNN heroes this year but on Sunday night, Anderson Cooper and Kelly Ripa announced the CNN Hero of the Year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  The CNN Hero of the Year is -- KELLY RIPPA AND COOPER:  Nelly Cheboi! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Congratulations to Nelly Cheboi. She creates computer labs for school children in her native Kenya. In 2019, Nelly quit her software engineering job to create her non-profit TechLit Africa. Since then, she's provided thousands of students with upcycled computers in a way to connect with the world. Voters online selected Nelly from a list of CNN's Top 10 Heroes. As CNN Hero of the Year, she will receive one hundred thousand dollars to expand her work. Her story is incredible. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NELLY CHEBOI, CNN 2022 HERO OF THE YEAR:  I never forget what it was like growing poor. I never forget what it was like my stomach churning because of hunger at night. I would have to go and scavenge for food at trash bits. We grew up in a tin roof house. It was full of potholes. I used to look at the different light bouncing from the holes from the roof, and then just imagine what we look like to sustainably fix poverty. I was a very hardworking student even though I wasn't in school often, and even though I was the most hardworking person I knew, I still did not know what a computer was. I am from Mogotio which is a small village in rural Kenya. And there isn't much of an economic activity here. I got a full-ride four-year scholarship in America at Augustana College in 2012. I got a job as a janitor cleaning bathrooms. I discovered computer science in my junior year of college just out of accident. I needed to take an introduction to java for my math major and I just fell in love with it. I just knew this was what I wanted to do and also bring it to my community. Every three years, companies are upgrading their IT. Most of these computers are ending up in landfills. Well, we have kids here, myself included back in the day, who don't even know what a computer is. And so, what we're doing is that we're working with institutions, colleges, companies, even individuals and then we bring it to the schools. We refurbish them. We install our own custom operating system that is geared towards teaching our kids self-efficacy, troubleshooting and Internet skills. All of you are going to be graphic designers today. The kids that we are working with are actually from four years old all the way to 12. And there's also vectors, it doesn't matter how much you zoom, it's still perfect, it's still a line. We have people coming in and just inspiring the kids. They can go from doing a remote class with NASA to music production, video production, coding, personal branding and so on. Right now, we're working with 4,000 kids. My hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, their families and themselves will not need aid because they can make money online. That money will support their families. Their money will support themselves. I can't even describe just how dehumanizing poverty is. Just getting crushed over and over again. My mom was working really hard and I was still going to bed hungry. I was still living in a house that was flooding. But the world is your oyster when you are educated. The thing that was really fascinating me growing up, not seeing change, not seeing hope, not even seeing progress. I feel like with this kid, I can see a path like, I can see a way where they can make a living online. And that is really like why we're doing this work. My life is bigger than myself. If I have the power to change anything, I have to do it. I have to give it my all. I can keep doing it. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, Mother Nature is up to snow good. Areas in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California were pummeled with up to three to four feet of snow over the weekend. Snow my goodness. Combine that with strong winds and even hail, and look out, don't get in that ski lift. It's about that time of year I guess whenever all that snow melts, it'll be thaw-some. If high fives, hugs and handshakes were snowflakes, I'd be sending you all a blizzard. Thank you for all the love. We're sending it right back to you. Shout out to Patrick Henry Middle School in Woodhaven, Michigan. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. END221214

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. It's your boy Coy. Wonderful Wednesday to you. Last week, so many of you accepted my challenge. You are giving me a unique word of your choice to work into the show. We had a lot of fun responses so we're doing it again. It's your word Wednesday. Follow me @CoyWire on Insta, Snapchat and TikTok, and put your challenge words in the comment section of my most recent post, and we're going to choose one fun word to work into Friday's show. All right. It's time for the best minutes in news because it's with you right here on CNN 10. We start with news on a winter storm. This week all across the country, winter storm warnings, winter storm watches and winter weather advisories have been issued by the National Weather Service. The strong start to the snow season is in place for an area that extends as far east as the upper Midwest, northern Great Lakes and interior parts of the Northeast. In fact, 25 million people from Texas to Mississippi are under threat of severe storms. In the south, two tornado watches are in effect. One in the Dallas area, the other in southern Oklahoma and about 15 million people largely in the north central U.S. are under winter weather warnings or advisories including fears of intense snow, ice, hail and freezing rain. These storms are leaving a trail of damage especially in parts of Oklahoma and Texas where buildings were wiped off of their foundation and homes and businesses were seriously damaged. In addition, roads were closed in traffic was delayed. This remains a developing story we're going to keep you updated right here on CNN throughout the rest of this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: in science, what is occurring when two atoms slam together to form a heavier atom? Combustion, fusion, fission or oxidation? Answer here is fusion. When two or more atoms are joined together to make a larger atom. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  This week, scientists with the U.S. Department of energy have reached a breakthrough in nuclear fusion for the first time ever in a lab setting, researchers say they generated more energy from a fusion reaction than they use to start the process. We're talking two or more atoms being fused together to form a larger one, and if scientists figure this out, fine tune it and harness this capability, we could potentially power our entire house from essentially a glass of water forever. This could help end dependence on fossil fuels. Talk about a game changer in the future of clean energy. We'll go now to CNN national correspondent Rene Marsh for more of the science behind the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RENE MARSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, scientists at a Department of Energy lab in California have figured out how to successfully produce a nuclear fusion reaction with a net energy gain. That means they've succeeded in taking two hydrogen atoms and using 192 powerful lasers to force those atoms to fuse together, unleashing the same kind of energy that powers the sun and stars. Until now, that has been incredibly difficult to replicate here on earth. The key is though that they've been able to release more energy from the reaction than they use in the fusion process itself and that's critically important. For anything to be a viable source it needs to have a higher energy output than the energy input used to generate the power. So this is a huge moment mostly because the discovery could eventually unlock an unlimited cheap, clean power source for the world. Now, this discovery has also proved this is a viable energy source and no longer a hypothetical scenario. But as major as this is in the quest to pivot away from dirty energy sources like fossil fuels, we're still a far away off from powering our homes by way of nuclear fusion it's estimated it could take two even three decades before this energy source is widely used. Rene Marsh, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  When hurricane Ian pummeled Florida in late September, it brought over $50 billion in damage to the state and tragically took lives of 148 people. It also had an unexpected consequence. It destroyed Florida's bee colonies. The colonies are used to pollinate the nation's agriculture. CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir spoke to Florida beekeepers about what this could mean. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Now you going to get a handful of bees. BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT:  Really? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes. WEIR:  OK. (voice-over):  I'm not usually in the habit of accepting a handful of stinging insects. But Keith Councell has a 40-year professional relationship with honeybees. And you never really wear a veil or gloves or anything? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't really need to. WEIR (voice over):  And these days, they need all the love they can get. Hurricane Ian arrived at the worst possible time for this business. Just as beekeepers from around the country were set up to catch the autumn bloom of the Brazilian peppertree. The storm drowned and crushed hundreds of thousands of hives, killing countless millions of bees. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's gone. You have to come back, right, nothing left. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You could actually see a water line where it came up to here. WEIR:  And because Ian blew away so much vegetation, those that survived are starving. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Some of these bees have going to get three shots of feed and that's a gallon. So you're talking about 36 pounds of feed already and you can still go back after they suck the feed down and it looks like they never were fed at all. WEIR:  They're just starving. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They're just starving. Yes, it's nonstop. So it's just an added cost and you're just trying to do the best you have to make that tough decision of really is it worth the money. The financial costs to try to save it or do you just have to walk away and take your medicine. WEIR:  This is all bee food. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This will be used for liquid bee food. Yeah. WEIR:  At Mann Lake Bee and Ag Supply, they're mixing sugar water as fast as they can. And while some bee farmers filed for federal relief, the Greater Good Charity is giving away a quarter ton of pollen substitute. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have donated meals to food pantries for humans. We've donated animal supplies to animal shelters. And now, we're donating this bee pollen substitute to these farmers here. WEIR:  Can't forget the bottom of the food chain, right? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, can't forget what helps get all the other food to the table as well. WEIR:  But even if their bees recover, the whole business depends on the health of the almond crop in California now shrinking under mega drought. If the drought takes out the almond crop in California that -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The whole beekeeping industry is going to be in trouble and there's no feral bees. There's no -- wild bees can't survive on their own. WEIR:  He explains the pesticides development and invasive pests have made it impossible for bees to survive without deliberate human care. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And if all the beekeepers released all of their bees, every beekeeper in the country, if they just released all their bees into the wild, we estimated about two to three years; the poor bees would just collapse. These are the most important farmer. They're the most forgotten as well. And that's why we just need the entire public to really continue to get involved in bees and a little -- two bee hives makes a big impact. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They went totally underwater, somehow made it. WEIR:  In the meantime, all Keith can do is pick up the pieces and focus on the survivors. Like the hive, he found drowned inside a water meter box near Fort Myers Beach. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's a different feeling and you have bees walking all over you. WEIR:  It really is. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And nobody's getting stung. Yes, they're doing their thing. WEIR:  Maybe they can sense we're rooting for him, you know? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, and that's part of the thing you have to treat him with respect. When you get down to it, the bees are the pillars to all agriculture. They're the pillars to our whole civilization. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE: And up next, an adorable story for our 10 out of 10. The Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control has strict rules about what types of animals people can have in their yards but they were hit with cuteness overload when they got a letter from a six-year-old Madeline asking if they'd let her keep a unicorn in their backyard if she's able to catch one someday. Well, knowing that unicorns are notoriously difficult to find in Los Angeles the department went ahead and gave her a stuffed unicorn in the meantime along with a permanent unicorn license. Good luck, Madeline. All right special shout out to Valley View Junior High in Jonesboro, Arkansas. Go Blazers. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. Can you believe that we're fewer than three weeks until 2022 is over? Well, I can't wait to celebrate the New Year with you. I'm Coy Wire and this is CNN 10. END221215

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. It is Thursday. So, happy Friday eve. I'm your host Coy Wire. Grateful to be right here with you on CNN 10.  We're here to break down some top storylines in an upbeat and easy to understand manner. This is our penultimate show before we take a long holiday break just today and tomorrow. So let's make the most of them. First up, government officials in the United States are preparing for a surge of migrants along the country's southern border with Mexico. A December deadline to terminate a public health authority known as Title 42 is coming up. The policy was created at the start of the coronavirus pandemic and allowed officials to quickly turn away migrants at the U.S. southern border due to concerns over the spread of the virus.  Well, an end to that restriction is expected to lead to an increase in border crossings and members within both Democrat and Republican parties are raising concerns over whether officials should consider a new policy. President Biden's administration is already asking Congress for more than $3 billion in assistance as it prepares for the end of the Title 42 policy. And the influx of migrants has already started. U.S. border officials have been contending with thousands of migrants crossing the border daily and expect those numbers to increase in the coming days and weeks. Let's break this story down by the numbers.  Over the weekend, U.S. border authorities apprehended more than 16,000 people. In a single section of the border in El Paso, Texas, more than 2,400 migrants crossed into the United States each day. Many officials speculate that the end of the title policy could overwhelm an already strained system.  We'll hear now from CNN national correspondent Ed Lavendera in El Paso, Texas, with the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  As the sun fades away over El Paso, a large group of migrants stand on the borders edge waiting to be processed by border patrol agents. While a few others tiptoe across a short path through the Rio Grande.  These migrants are part of a major surge of border crossings seen in El Paso in recent days, and it is happening as the projected and of a Trump era restriction draws closer, ending the policy to swiftly expel migrants at the U.S. land borders.  U.S. border authorities interacted with more than 2 million migrants in the last year, up from the previous year. But in recent days, an average of almost 2,500 migrants a day have been moving across this border, between Mexico and the U.S. through El Paso.  CLAUDIA RODRIGUEZ, EL PASO CITY COUNCIL MEMBER:  Title 42 is only going to make that situation worse, they're going to have more apprehension, so we are going to see a lot more releases into the community, and we're not prepared for it.  LAVANDERA:  Just three weeks ago, according to Customs and Border Protection, the seven-day rolling average was fewer than 1,700. Thousands of migrants are now coming from Central and South America as well as Cuba, according to U.S. immigration officials.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm helping them get food, whatever they need. This is not even about politics. It's about humanity. These people are here and they are cold.  LAVANDERA:  Some have been camping out across the border in Ciudad Juarez, in Mexico, raising concerns they will cross in mass if Trump era border restrictions end about a week.  Still, others have already been boarded into buses to be processed or turned around under the provisions of Title 42.  JAKE SULLIVAN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  We are taking steps to be able to manage the expiration of Title 42 and to put in place a process that will be orderly and humane. We believe that in doing so we can protect our national security concerns.  LAVANDERA:  Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas arrived in El Paso today, and says he is meeting with Customs and Border Protection, local officials, and organizations.  For now, the immediate problem is housing, and managing a large influx of migrants.  RUBEN GARCIA, DIRECTOR, ANNUNCIATION HOUSE:  If the court cases get resolved, and the courts allow Title 42 to be lifted, we are going to see thousands of refugees for whom there isn't shelter.  LAVANDERA:  The director of a local El Paso shelter says border patrol recently dropped a busload of migrants at his doorstep. And he is worried he will soon have to turn people away.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're going to have to say no, not because we want to, but simply because we don't have space. The reality is, there's just too many people.  (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What is the most populated country in the world? Russia, China, United States or India? With an estimated 1.4 billion people, China edges out India as the most populated country in the world.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  As we've discussed, China is reopening its doors after three years of its zero COVID policy, the last country on the planet to do so. While the policy did keep spread of the virus low, it stressed the daily lives of citizens inside the country, with mandatory tests and quarantines. But now that many of the restrictions in China have been removed, by many accounts, the streets feel more empty than when's restrictions were there. Why? Because fear of the virus remains, in large part because coronavirus is spreading quickly in China. More now from CNN international correspondent Selina Wang who's on the scene in Beijing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  China is starting to unravel its zero COVID policy. But instead of crowds out celebrating, this is how reopening is going in China -- close shops, empty streets, people avoiding each other because for the first time since the start of the pandemic, COVID is spreading like wildfire in Beijing. People now either have COVID or they're scared to get it. So I just spoke to the shop worker in the store and he told me that he's the only employee without COVID which is why he can still come to work and he says, I am the only customer who has come into this store all day. The only crowds I'm seeing in Beijing outside of hospitals like this and pharmacies.  So he says his fever's gone down but he still has a cold, hoping to buy medicine but he's worried they don't have any stock because there's these long lines forming outside of pharmacies across the country people are trying to stock up but stuff is selling out.  You know, for years, China has been demonizing COVID, playing up the risks of long COVID and now suddenly state media is publishing headlines every day saying COVID is not a big deal. It's whiplash for a lot of people because just weeks before, if you got COVID, your whole community would have gone into hard lockdown. This is such a major and sudden change.  So China is finally opening up. How do you feel about it?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I feel is pretty great. I wish they could have opened up earlier. WANG:  Has business been very slow or difficult? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, you can see, there -- there are not that many customers. A lot of people just got the virus. WANG:  Are you scared about getting COVID? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm worried about my parents and my grandparents a little bit. WANG:  People are relieved though that you no longer have to go to a quarantined facility if you get COVID. Getting sent to one of those rundown facilities was such a big source of anxiety before. And these health QR codes that have been used for years to track and dictate where we can go -- well, the government is now saying that you don't need them to enter most public places. So I don't need to scan my code. It feels surreal though that I can literally just walk in. So she said I can only do online delivery. So you can't even sit inside or order inside in Shake Shack.  So outside the Starbucks, they have a sign saying you need to show a 40- hour COVID test, even though the national rules don't require it, in Beijing, you still need a recent PCR test in order to enter restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues. There are way less places now to get COVID tests in the city, and the lines are short because most people are just staying at home. But just a week before, at this exact same location, this was packed with people waiting in line. So behind me is a graveyard of COVID testing booths. It's like almost overnight in Beijing, they removed all of these testing locations and here's the remnants. After years of harsh lockdowns, the government is finally letting people manage their own health. But people don't feel ready and experts say the country isn't either. The country hasn't vaccinated enough of the elderly population and has it improved the health care capacity enough. So this reopening it's going to continue to be messy and uneven. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's 10 out of 10, a family from Gretna, Virginia, is an enlightened bunch who really know how to conduct themselves at Christmas time. Mike Clay says he used more than 30,000 lights to decorate his house and it lights up the entire street. Inspired by the movie "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation", he says he decorates in memory of his grandfather. His light bill jumps up by a hundred dollars though during the month but he says it's total really worth it. If loving Christmas is wrong, Mr. Clay don't want to be light because he loves Christmas a lots. Shout out to Clark Middle School in Anchorage, Alaska.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. You made it to Friday, and you already know Friday's rock. Now, this is a last show of 2022, and one thing making it extra special is that you helped write it. See if you can find your word that you sent me via social media sprinkled somewhere within.  I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. Let's finish this week's strong. We start with news on the economy, specifically the labor force. Employers need workers and that's good news. There's nearly two job openings for every job seeker. The shortage of workers in the United States has many employers ready to fight to retain talent. This is especially good for previously untapped labor populations where traditionally it was difficult to get a job.  And it also seems particularly good news for job-seeking women. The last jobs report revealed that 62 percent of the job gains last month went to women, narrowing the gap in labor force participation rate between men and women.  New data this week shows that middle-aged men ages 35 to 44 have been slow to rejoin labor force recently the participation rate for men ages to 30 to 44 is lower than it was before the pandemic. Economists say there are many reasons the male labor force participation rate is down, including changing needs and interests in the post-pandemic world.  We'll hear more now from CNN reporter Vanessa Yurkevich who has reported extensively on the labor market. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID SHNITZLER, AT-HOME DAD:  Good morning, Winston. Let's start the day.  YURKEVICH (voice over):  It's a typical day in the Shnitzler household. Seventeen month old Winston is up and parents David and Allison (ph) are getting ready for work. Winston is fed, there's some play, and then the morning good-byes.  ALLISON SHNITZLER, FAMILY PHYSICIAN:  Bye-bye. D. SHNITZLER:  Say bye-bye. YURKEVICH:  They're off to work. A. SHNITZLER:  Bye-bye. Have a good day. YURKEVICH:  Allison, a family physician, and David, an insurance underwriter, now an at-home dad.  D. SCHNITZLER:  Caring for Winston, tending to the house, playing with him, all of that comes first.  YURKEVICH:  Last year the Schnitzler's made a significant life change.  D. SCHNITZLER:  We made that decision to have me stay home.  YURKEVICH:  David quit his job to take care of Winston full time so Allison could continue her career.  D. SCHNITZLER:  We're happy with the roles that we're in. It's phenomenal.  YURKEVICH:  And in recent months, more men ages 30 to 44 have been dropping out of the workforce according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The labor force participation rate for men in that age group is lower than it was pre-pandemic.  RICHARD V. REEVES, SENOR FELLOW, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION:  I don't think it's a secret that many of us rethought our whole work life balance, what were we doing, who's raising the kids, how do we want our family to work? That's a question that a lot of families have been asking themselves. YURKEVICH:  And more women in recent months ages 30 to 44 are participating in the labor force and at a higher rate than pre- pandemic according to Labor Department data. And they're moving into more male dominated industries.  REEVES:  The fears of a she-cession turned out largely to be unfounded. Women are returning to the labor market. It's becoming increasingly common to see women, for example, having project management roles or generally management positions within construction.  YURKEVICH:  Women like Ava Sedaghat.  AVA SEDAGHAT, PROJECT ENGINEER:  I knew I wanted to work in construction management.  YURKEVICH:  Sedaghat joined the construction industry two years ago as a project engineer. Today, women make up just 14 percent of the construction industry, but it's the highest on record.  SEDAGHAT:  I think it was definitely intimidating. My only knowledge of the construction industry was that it was pretty heavy and male dominated. But the more that I started working in the industry and the more people I came into contact with, I think I realized pretty quickly on that there's a place for everyone in construction.  (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia:  The term "metaverse" was coined by: A science fiction writer, the founder of Facebook, a programmer at Google, or a college professor? In 1992, the term metaverse was coined by sci-fi writer Neal Stephenson.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ever since its inception, the metaverse has had many people flummoxed, even flabbergasted. Is it simply like a video game or could it evolve actually into a common way of life?  In the metaverse, you can virtually be transported from your couch to a classroom, from a living room to a work luncheon. You could walk alongside a hippopotamus on safari or wear a spinny hat and get rambunctious with friends at a concert by Bieber, Drake in the weekend, and you wouldn't even have to leave your room. While this technology is catching up with fantasy, it's still being built and is constantly evolving. CNN reporter Anna Stewart has more from Dubai. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN CORESPONDENT:  Remember this movie? The concept of a virtual universe is rooted in science fiction and for years, it's been just that fiction. But now, technology is beginning to catch up, bringing the idea of the metaverse to reality.  It's home to concerts, expensive digital real estate and hugely popular games. But what exactly is the metaverse? What does it do, and why should you care? Let's break it down. NEAL STEPHENSON, AUTHOR, SNOW CRASH:  It means a virtual environment. STEWART:  This is Neal Stephenson. He came up with a term metaverse back in 1992. For his book "Snow Crash". Back to you Neal. STEPHENSON:  Where large numbers of people can get together and interact with each other, not as they are but through avatars, which are kind of the three-dimensional representations. STEWART:  For so long, our experiences with the Internet have been 2D, it's been something we look at. But the metaverse gives users the sense of being transported into the Internet like this.  Oh hi. ANDREW BOSWORTH, CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER, META:  Hello. STEWART:  Meet Andrew Bosworth, also known as Boz. He works at Meta, formerly named Facebook. Great.  Do we shake hands? How does this work? BOSWORTH:  We can do a high five.  STEWART:  This is Horizon Workrooms, the company's foothold in the metaverse. It's just one of the many ways into the metaverse that are currently available. In these virtual worlds, you can play games, do business and dance with strangers that turn into friends, except that this friend could be on the other side of the world. BOSWORTH:  Is it as good as being together? No, and it probably never will be, but it's the next best thing. STEWART:  This all sounds exciting, until you realize that the technology for building this new iteration of the Internet is -- well, still being built. For now, it's this place where you can be whoever you want and immerse your virtual self into this alternative world that pushes past physical barriers, to collaborate and interact with other virtual avatars, objects and environments.  As promising as it all may sound, we still have a long way to go before we're living like this.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello from Buffalo, everyone. It's your boy Coy and we have missed you. We hope the start of your New Year has been full of love and positive energy. I know we're feeling it now that we are back. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we start with a remarkable story that has transpired here in Buffalo, New York, this past week. Bills' player Damar Hamlin was tragically injured, suffering cardiac arrest in the first quarter of their game last Monday. And in an unprecedented move, Bills players and head coach Sean McDermott refused to play on. In the past, games have always played on, but these NFL players prioritize their mental health over the outcome of the game.  Hamlin spent the following days in critical condition but eventually showed enough progress to surprise the team with a video called days before their final regular season game. The team said that's all they needed. The game was magical. Bills head coach Sean McDermott said it was going to be a celebration of life, the power of three, Damar's jersey number was everywhere. Then, powerful moment, the medical workers and training staff who pounced in with poise and precision to save Damar Hamlin's life walk to midfield getting an ovation as big as any we've ever heard. Then, game time. And on the opening play, the Bills first since the tragic injury goosebumps, when Nyheim Hines took the kickoff back for a touchdown. It had been three years and three months since the Bills had done that before. Bills star quarterback Josh Allen said it was spiritual, bone chilling, and Damar Hamlin watching from the hospital tweeted: God behind all this no coincidence. Buffalo would go on to win 35-23. Here's star offensive lineman Dion Dawkins on what he's learned through all of this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DION DAWKINS, BUFFALO BILLS:  No second, no breath, no event, no situation is promised. It could be a drastic this or this at any moment. And I have truly learned to be a better father, to be a better partner, to be a better person. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Remember lovely people, we can find strength through our struggles, find heroes through heartache. The world has come together to support Damar Hamlin. His GoFundMe charity to raise money to buy toys for kids originally set out to raise twenty five hundred dollars. It has skyrocketed to more than $8.5 million so far. All right. Next up, we're bringing you to Washington, D.C. with an update on what's happening in the U.S. Congress. Every time a new political party gains the majority in the House of Representatives, a new speaker of the House is elected. The speaker is in charge of the House's legislative agenda, its committee assignments, and deciding on voting procedures.  Democrat Nancy Pelosi stepped down from her role as speaker of the House in November following the U.S. midterm elections where Republicans won back control of the House. This week, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy was elected speaker, but it wasn't easy. McCarthy made numerous concessions over the course of many days before he finally earned a majority and was elected on the 15th round of voting.  To secure the gavel, McCarthy and his allies overcame opposition from a group of conservative critics within the Republican Party. It was the longest contest in 164 years. Many Republicans fear this may make it harder to govern in the future while Democrats who voted unanimously for their candidate, the minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, were happy to see what many called chaos for the opposing party. More now from politics reporter Eva McKend who has more on the proceeding from the nation's capital. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER:  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy securing a victory at long last by picking off his detractors one by one, doing so through making some key concessions. Namely, it will require only one member to trigger a vote that could potentially lead to ousting the House speaker. Take a listen to what McCarthy had to say after the vote. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Don't judge us on how we start, watch how we finish. And I think by having the disruption now really built the trust with one another and learned how to work together. What we're going to have to find in our mindset is that we have to front load that we have to think about and work on the bills with a microcosm of the conference before we even start writing it and that's really what we learned here. MCKEND:  So you can hear McCarthy there really striking in optimistic tone Republicans have done so as well, arguing that this week really illustrated that this is what democracy looks like. That sometimes it is messy -- well, Democrats, they have a different view. They say that the chaotic episodes that played out on the House floor time and time again really illustrate that Republicans are not prepared to govern.  They will face another key test. This new Republican leadership on Monday when they have to vote on a House rules package. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Okay. Yesterday, President Joe Biden made his first trip in office to the U.S.-Mexico border where he visited El Paso, Texas. This follows a major immigration policy announcement by the president who visited the border Sunday for a first-hand view of the border enforcement operation. Biden has faced backlash in recent months from both Democrats in his own party and Republicans who believe he has not managed immigration issues well while in office. Democrats condemn recent immigration policies as human rights violations while Republicans say the president has not done enough to limit border crossing amid recent surge.  We'll hear now from Arlette Saenz, a CNN White House correspondent based in D.C. who has more on the details of the visit. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  El Paso, Texas, a city that has seen a surge in migrants in recent weeks. Officials here at the White House say the president wants to see get an assessment of the border security situation on the ground there, and he will meet and hear from officials with Customs and Border Protection. The president will also be joined on this trip by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.  And officials have also said he the president wants to learn more about the efforts to stem fentanyl flow into the country.  Now, this all comes as the president has faced pressure not just to visit the border but also address these issues regarding the border, as it has quickly become a political liability for President Biden. The Texas governor, a Republican, Greg Abbott, said that it's about time that President Biden paid that visit down to the U.S.-Mexico border.  But on the other hand, the president has also accused Republicans of engaging in demagoguery, saying that they need to come to the table to pass comprehensive immigration reform which this White House says is the only way to fully ease these issues relating to the border.

Answer is: the smallest and shallowest ocean on earth is the Arctic Ocean. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next up, a snowy owl normally found in the Arctic tundra shows up 3,000 miles away amid palm trees and beaches of sunny southern California. The extremely rare sighting has transfixed a California community, but as for how the owl arrived there, who-who could know? Maybe CNN reporter Jeanne Moos. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It's a head scratcher, all right, how did a snowy owl that normally lives in the Arctic tundra end up amid the palm trees of southern California? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I consider an honor to be able to see the bird. MOOS:  Bird lovers are flocking to Cypress, California, to get a peek. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That's so exciting. I see a bird that does not belong here. MOOS:  Yeah. Well, not everyone is excited. JARET DAVEY, WETLANDS AND WILDLIFE CARE CENTER:  There were all these crows that were just dive bombing it and trying to like scare it away and the owl was just unfazed. MOOS:  Not so unfazed, the birder who posted this video Nicholas Belardes admits, "I teared up". A marine biologist told "The New York Times" it's like seeing Santa Claus on a beach.  Wildlife experts are watching the owl like a hawk, even to the point of climbing up a ladder to retrieve a pellet regurgitated by the raptor. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh so a treasure right away. MOOS:  The birds expel the indigestible parts of their meals, so the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center decided to check on the owl's taste in California cuisine. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This looks like the skull. Yeah, look at that, the skull of some kind of rodent. MOOS:  We know what it ate but we don't know how it got here. Is it an escaped illegal pet? Or did it hitch a ride on a freighter from up north? Or maybe it just got disoriented and flew too far south? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It looks nice and fluffy. MOOS:  Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, still here in Buffalo, New York. Yesterday, I told you about the remarkable story of the Buffalo Bills who rallied in their final game of the regular season for their injured teammate Damar Hamlin who suffered cardiac arrest during their game last week. Well, I am happy to report that Damar has been released from the hospital in Cincinnati and is back in Buffalo. So some encouraging news to start our day. All right. We've got a big show for you but only 10 minutes to do it, so let's get to it. We start with the latest news from Brazil. Political unrest gripping the streets of Brazil this week. Supporters of the country's former president, Jair Bolsonaro, storming official buildings in the capitol to protest what they believe was a stolen election. The election was narrowly won by former Brazilian President Lula da Silva, who first served in the role from 2003 to 2011.  But Bolsonaro encouraged supporters to question the country's electronic voting system. Over one thousand people were arrested for protesting. Bolsonaro supporters have been camping out in tent cities ever since the election back in October.  The new president will face major challenges early on as divisions in the country feel profound. More now from CNN's Rafael Romo, a senior Latin American affairs editor of CNN worldwide.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR:  Brazil boiling over. Supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro stormed key buildings in the country's capital Sunday breaching security barriers and temporarily occupying the country's Congress, presidential palace and Supreme Court.  Masses of protesters flooded the country's seat of power, many dressed in the colors of Brazil's flag yellow and green, fueled by anger and distrust over Bolsonaro's defeat in a runoff election last October where he lost by less than two percentage points to current President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva.  Protesters threw objects and scaled the roofs of buildings, while clashing with police who responded with tear gas. At least one protester was seen sitting at the desk of Brazil's congress president.  CNN Brazil reports the floor of the Congress building was flooded after the sprinkler system activated when protesters attempted to set fire to the carpet. By evening, police began dispersing the rioters from buildings and arrested hundreds of people who were detained in buses before being taken to the police station. President Lula Da Silva who was inaugurated just a week ago described the events as barbaric and vowed to punish the people responsible. LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Those people that we call fascists. We call them everything that's abominable in politics. They invaded the government headquarters,. and they invaded the Congress like vandals, destroying everything in their path. ROMO:  President Lula da Silva also blamed his predecessor for the lack of security in the capital where Bolsonaro's supporters have been camped out for over a week. Bolsonaro who is currently in Florida denounced what he called the depredations and invasions of public buildings in a tweet, adding that peaceful and lawful demonstrations are part of democracy.  But critics say Bolsonaro may have stirred up the crowds by repeatedly saying without evidence that he questioned the integrity of the country's electronic voting system. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: After China, India, and the United States, which country has the highest population? Pakistan, Russia, Indonesia or Mexico? Home to over 275 million people, the fourth most populated country in the world is the archipelago of Indonesia. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Next, we're traveling to the province of Bali, Indonesia, where Bali is facing a water crisis. Once clean water is dirty from tourism development, population growth and water mismanagement. While Bali sees a lot of rain, water shortages are already impacting Bali's culture and the people's quality of life, and experts warn the situation will worsen if water control practices aren't properly implemented. Let's go now to Bali to learn more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The Indonesian province Bali is known for its rich culture, breathtaking natural beauty and rain, lots of rain. But while tourism took a hit during the COVID-19 pandemic, a five-month rainy season doesn't stop millions from visiting the island in a typical year. And for those who live here, the seasonal deluge serves as a reminder of an ongoing water crisis. In fact, one innovative local school has made the stuff of life the centerpiece of its curriculum. LESLIE MEDEMA, HEAD OF CAMPUS, GREEN SCHOOL BALI:  We chose water as a theme for last year and this year because despite what everybody thinks, there's a water shortage in Bali. We have rains for months and months and months, and they fill the reservoirs but very, very quickly those reservoirs run dry. WEIR:  More tourists and residents take a dramatic toll on the island's natural water resources, but that's not the only concern. MEDEMA:  Just in the last 10 years, many, many villages have been noticing their once clean water has turned very, very dirty, and no longer usable. We've noticed a very serious water crisis arising in a place where that really shouldn't be the case. WEIR:  Tucked away in a forested patch miles inland from the southern beaches, the Green School Bali was built to create the next generation of problem solvers. MEDEMA:  Currently on campus, there are student-led projects that have been activated. WEIR:  Built from bamboo and other sustainable material, the impressive open-air facilities were designed to inspire imagination and creativity, each structure a base for what the school's founders call a living curriculum. MEDEMA:  The point is to be part of reimagining education, to be something that inspires action-based learning now all across the globe.  WEIR:  We are cultivating an optimistic, thoughtful and positive approach to climate and climate action. We want them to feel hopeful. We want them to feel like they have the skills, they have the ability to engage proactively in the world. After a group of students became fascinated with biofuels, the school created a network of bio buses, each running on used cooking oil refined by science. MEDEMA:  You're looking at a really wide-ranging learning experience from enterprise to marketing to management because it became its own company and the largest biofuel transportation company in Indonesia. WEIR:  Dipta is an 11th grader driven to find solutions by the desperate need close to home. DIPTA, STUDENT, GREEN SCHOOL BALI:  It starts off personally, right? The problem comes off from my hometown Kintamani, we didn't have enough water and then after that realizing that also a lot of other people don't have access to clean and drinkable water. He launched Liquify, a non-profit with a mission to provide sustainable filtration systems, help residents build recharge wells that replenish aquifers, and water catchment systems to collect rainfall for other uses.  DIPTA:  The innovation hub that we have at green school gives me the tools to create what I need to create, what I want to create, and to help me help other people as well. The Green School Bali opened in 2008 and now includes locations in New Zealand, South Africa and Mexico. MEDEMA:  Our mission is a community of learners making our world sustainable. And so when you put community back at the center of a school, you end up being more accountable for the actions that you take and I think that's a good thing. It's the full spectrum of local to global action-based environmental learning. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEIR:  And for today's "10 out of 10", a family in Plainville, Connecticut, could barely believe what they discovered in their backyard. Their dog started acting all nervous one day and they soon learned a black bear was hibernating under their deck.  After contacting their local environmental agency for advice, the family decided to do the bare minimum. They're going to grin and bear it and have a backyard slumber party all winter, just let the big fellas news I guess and hibernate. And around mid-March though, old sleepy is going to wake up and the first thing bears typically do is they search for food so look out doggy. All right. Dad joke alert: what do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear. All right. Time for our special shout out today. Madison County High School in Madison, Florida. Go Cowboys!

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. I wonderful Wednesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we've got a rendezvous with the news. Still here in Buffalo, New York, outside of Buffalo General Hospital, and yet another positive update on Bills player Damar Hamlin who suffered cardiac arrest during a game last week. Hospital officials have told us doctors are optimistic that Damar could be well enough to go home in the coming days and his parents are here in Buffalo reunited alongside their son. So wonderful, wonderful news. Next up today, a prominent research group in Washington recently conducted a war game simulation of a possible conflict. It's one that's preoccupied military and political leaders in Asia and across the world. The scenario would be an invasion by China against Taiwan. Taiwan is a democratically ruled island of 24 million people that the Chinese Communist Party believes belongs to their sovereign territory. The Center for Strategic and International Studies ran the program as software that it claims is one of the most extensive war game simulations ever conducted on a possible conflict over Taiwan. The company believes the project was necessary because previous government and private company war simulations have focused too narrowly on the possible way events in an invasion might unfold and weren't specific enough on how to help the government and policymakers try to prepare for how a potential conflict may play out. Let's go to Washington now to hear from CNN Pentagon correspondent Oren Liebermann who has details from the results of the simulations. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Taiwan is perhaps the most sensitive flash point between the U.S. and China. Some experts are warning that Beijing's use of force to claim what it sees as its rightful territory is drawing closer. Chairman Xi Jinping has made it a priority for Beijing which hasn't ruled out the use of force, a decision that could cost thousands of lives for China, Taiwan, and America. A war game from the Center for Strategic and International Studies begins with a Chinese missile barrage against Taiwan's military in 2026, destroying much of its air force and navy, followed by an amphibious across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwanese forces fight back using advanced U.S. weaponry -- Patriot missiles for air defense, anti-ship missiles and torpedoes for sea defense, and its ground forces to defend the beachheads. The top U.S. general says the key to avoiding conflict is deterrence. GEN. MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF:  As long as we remain number one, then we will deter the war that people worry about, a great power war between China and the United States. LIEBERMANN:  Crucially, this war game doesn't ask the question of what would happen to make China decide to use military force to invade Taiwan. That remains an open question. But it's a crucial one to understanding the situation, especially given the West's reaction to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, sanctions that have crippled Russia's economy. Would China run the same risk given its own imports and exports, given its industrial economic power, or would it use those powers to try to control Taiwan without using its military? And that is a critical question. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: "Flindrikin" and "unbrak" are words used in Scotland to describe what? Food, snow, hairstyles or movies? There are over 400 words in Scotland for snow with flindrikin, meaning a light snow. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE: Right now, those words for snow aren't being used much and that's because it's shorts weather across large parts of Europe right now. Thousands of temperature records were shattered in an historic winter warm spell. In fact, temperatures are 18 to 36 degrees higher than average this month. In Poland, it's up to about 66 degrees, parts of Spain about 77 degrees. This is good news for the economy but bad news for Russia who hoped cutting energy exports to Europe would cause the economy to suffer. But it's not all good news. Many Alpine ski resorts have closed or at least partially shut down because of a lack of snow, and there's also concern about what this higher than normal weather means for the environment. Up next, we'll hear from CNN anchor and correspondent Isa Soares who's on the ground in Europe with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The New Year may have only just begun, but temperatures are already heating up across much of Europe. At least eight countries smashed their winter weather record, having recorded their warmest day ever in January. As the world rang in New Year's celebrations this week, climatologists were busy tracking extreme temperatures and found countries including Poland, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Lichtenstein and Belarus all reached alarmingly warm temperatures on January the 1st. Meteorologists say it's too early to attribute the extreme heat to climate change but do say the driving force is a warm air mass from Africa's west coast moving across Europe. It may look warm in the Spanish city of Bilbao, but locals are noticeably wearing winter coats, basking in the winter sun. EUSEBIO FOLGEIRA, BILBAO, SPAIN, RESIDENT (through translator):  It's not normal for Bilbao to have such good weather. It always rains a lot here. It's very cold, and it's January. And it feels like summer. SOARES:  And what would normally be covered in snow, this ski resort in France is now starved of it, forcing businesses to shut their doors to customers until conditions improve. GREGORY ROMANO, RESTAURANT MANAGER (through translator):  Sure we are, of course, a little bit sad about having to close. We had a good Christmas holiday season, which matters. SOARES:  Over in war torn Ukraine, with much of the country's energy infrastructure damaged or destroyed, millions of Ukrainians were without power over Christmas. The cities across the country, including Kyiv, broke weather records in January, which may have helped reduce energy consumption. As Ukrainian advisor Anton Gerashchenko put at it, even the weather is on our side. Just before the year came to an end, the U.K.'s Met office said last year sweltering heat, which ran rivers dry and caused a drought in parts of England, was the country's hottest on record. Though January's mild temperatures might provide some relief to the cold, meteorologists warn it could offer a glimpse of a concerning and possibly even warmer future. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, a vast array of new cutting edge technology and some just plain strange technology were shown off by companies at the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas last week. Many inventions offered a new twist on old problems and global challenges. CNN international anchor Lynda Kinkade has the story and as you watch, think about what your favorite gadget is and let me know why @CoyWire wire on social. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LYNDA KINKADE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Thousands of emerging startups and global brands are showcasing cutting edge gadgets and gizmos designed to help solve some of the world's greatest challenges from the day to day to the life-saving by taking the guesswork out of testing the ripeness of an avocado relieve anxiety with a therapeutic cat pillow that wags. SHUNSUKE AOKI, PRESIDENT & CEO, YUKAI ENGINEERING:  The more you cuddle, it -- the more excited it gets. KINKADE:  Health innovations are prominently featured, trying to brain scanning helmet that claims to detect early signs of dementia and Parkinson's. Rest your head on a pillow designed to give a better night's sleep, and watch a demo of an at-home defibrillator, a device that the company says saved 17 lives last year. JOHANN KALCHMA, CEO, LIFEAZ:  But we have developed the first life-saving defibrillator made for the home, so anyone can have it at home. It's extremely simple to use. It's portable; you can have it at home. You can have it in your backpack when you do the gym, when you go on vacation. KINKADE:  Glide past the booths on a remote controlled pair of electric rollerblades that can go about 30 kilometers an hour. And check out an autonomous wheelchair that hopes to soon transport travelers to their gate at the airport with a click of a button. JUSTIN GAGNON, VP OF SALES AND MARKETING, WHILL, INC.:  So it's an autonomous wheelchair, so passenger will get into the chair, select what gate they're going to be going to and then the chair just takes them directly to that gate. They don't need to drive it. They don't need to tell it where it needs to go. It'll just take them right there. KINKADE:  Cars have become a big part of CES, with major automakers and others showcasing cutting edge advancements and nearly 300 exhibitors expected. It will be one of the largest auto shows in the world. This year there will also be a lot of talk about web 3 and the Metaverse. So as with most of what you'll find, it will take a while before all these gadgets become widely available. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, we have a story that's going to rocket your world. Check out this rocket ride high into the skies above.

OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Hope your Thursday is off to a fantastic start. I'm Omar Jimenez, a CNN national correspondent based in New York, and I'm filling in for the one and only Coy rest of the week. We're going to be covering extreme weather in California and looking at the potential impact of social media on teens.  But first, we're going to start with news from the sky. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a short ground stop yesterday of all domestic planes after there was an outage to a system that provides pilots with notices they need before flying. Now normal operations resumed later yesterday morning, but delays from the ground stop continued into the day.  When we recorded our show on Wednesday, there were more than flight delays nationwide. The airports in Chicago, O'Hare International and Midway International Airports, were especially impacted and they continued to have a ground stop for all inbound and outbound flights into the day on Wednesday.  Now, the specific system experiencing the outage is called the notice to air missions which alerts it's about closed runways equipment outages and potential hazards along a flight route or at a location that could impact flight. The Biden administration and secretary of transportation, Pete Buttigieg, are looking into what caused this disruption and if you saw over Christmas, Southwest Airlines canceled thousands of flights stranding tens of thousands of travelers. The federal government is zeroing in on Southwest and their system to figure out how to prevent future issues like these. All right. Ten-second trivia:  Name the third largest U.S. state whose state motto is eureka.  Is it Texas, Alaska, California, or Montana? And meaning "I have found it", eureka is the state motto of California. Up next, we're headed to California where residents across the state are recovering from deadly storms that brought area rainfall totals 400 percent to 600 percent above average. The storm meant heavy downpours and strong winds forcing thousands of evacuations. Response crews were responsible for clearing flooded neighborhoods and crumbled roadways and at least people have died as a result.  Also, more than million people are under flood alerts this week and it's not over yet. Another round of rain is on the way. It's the first of four more atmospheric river events. But what does that mean? Atmospheric rivers are long, narrow regions in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles. They're expected to hit California in the next 10 days. So we'll hear now from Kyung Lah, a national correspondent for CNN based in Los Angeles. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  During recent historic droughts, California prayed for rain, but not like this.  Two days of torrential rain, thunderstorms, and wind gusts are pounding California, causing mudslides, overflowing rivers, and triggering extensive flooding.  LYNDA HOPKINS, SUPERVISOR, SONOMA COUNTY:  We've got trees down. We've got mudslides. We've got actually folks trapped in areas where we have major road failures.  LAH:  At least 17 people have died as a result of the storms, after more than 18 inches of rain fell in parts of southern California. And high wind advisories were issued on the central coast.  In San Francisco, a rare hailstorm in Haight-Ashbury. And throughout northern California -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The rain hammered here pretty bad.  LAH:  -- the rushing river has flooded, following torrential downpours. Some residents have been without power for a week. In Santa Barbara County, mass evacuations, after that storm saturated the ground. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was pouring, the wind was whipping.  LAH:  Following years of extreme drought and fires.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On the mountainside here, the debris started coming down, filling up to four feet or so. Pretty much buried the truck, and now it's starting to flow.  LAH:  More than 30 million people are under flood alerts, and across southern California, flash flooding trapped drivers. Firefighters here rescued a motorist stranded in rushing waters. And mud and rockslides creating havoc for residents.  TYRONNE MCGRATH, RESIDENT, CASITAS SPRING:  A 800-pound rock just smashed the house, it just hit the wall and blew everything out.  LAH:  In northern California, the rain flooded roads, and vineyards, it almost doubled the snow pack in local mountains, offering hope that these storms may somehow ease California's historic drought.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're riding through it. Yeah, it could be a lot worse.  (END VIDEOTAPE) LAH (on camera):  It's hard to think about drought when this is what southern California is dealing with. I'm standing on a roadway that goes back behind, me you cannot see it because of all the debris on this road. This came from this mountain, this hillside five years ago burned in a wildfire. And with all the rain and lack of vegetation, it all came down onto the street and into these yards.  The concern now is what happens in the upcoming days, with rain in the forecast.  JIMENEZ:  Up next, we'll hear from Vanessa Yurkevich, a CNN business and politics reporter, who recently took a look at social media, specifically TikTok's impact on teen brains. Her reporting focuses on social media usage and the rate of depression especially among Gen Z users. Her research comes as more than a dozen state governments have actually banned TikTok on government-issued devices and at least 22 states have taken some sort of action on TikTok since 2020.  So let's hear more about her research in the teens she speaks with on the ground. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS REPORTER (voice-over):  In just five years, TikTok has amassed more than one billion global users. Eyeballs around the world glued to the endless content and viral videos. How long do you think you spend on TikTok every day? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Two to three hours. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Three to four hours. YURKEVICH:  But last month, the U.S. government, along with more than a dozen states, banned TikTok on most federal devices, citing national security concerns over its Chinese parent company and the possibility it could pressure TikTok to hand over personal data.  There is no public evidence the Chinese government has done that but there is evidence of another risk, social media's impact on mental health particularly among Gen Z. DR. JEAN TWENGE, PSYCHOLOGIST:  Teen depression started to rise after 2012. So did self-harm. YURKEVICH:  Dr. Gene Twenge says as smartphones and social media grew, so did the rate of depression among teens, nearly doubling between 2004 and 2019. By that year, one in four U.S. teen girls had experienced clinical depression according to Twenge.  TWENGE:  What the algorithms trying to do is get people able to use the app for longer because that's how the company makes more money. YURKEVICH:  TikTok in a statement said, quote, one of our most important commitments is supporting the safety and well-being of teens and we recognize this work is never finished. We continue to focus on robust safety protections for our community while also empowering parents with additional controls for their teen's account through TikTok family pairing. Users of TikTok spent an average of an hour and a half a day on the app last year, more than any other social platform. What is it that keeps you scrolling even if you know maybe you've spent one two hours on it? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Once you watch the one video, you're like, well, time to watch another. So you just keep doing it's like a cycle you don't realize that the time is passing.  YURKEVICH:  That's exactly what happened to Jerome Yankee (ph). UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I've definitely done all-nighters on TikTok before I had just been scrolling until the sun came up. YURKEVICH:  He says he lost sleep. His grades suffered. He lost touch with his friends. He lost his sense of self. In 2021, he deleted the app. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Getting disappointed by my own life is never something I want to be doing, especially when I have the power to change it but I just wasn't because I was spending hours on this app. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have like a lot of cool resources that we give to our audience for free. YURKEVICH:  But Hannah Williams (ph) proves the positive side of TikTok, allowing her to create a business, Salary Transparent Street, providing paid transparency to her new nearly million followers. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think TikTok definitely helped just because they have such audience reach potential. YURKEVICH:  She hopes TikTok's algorithm works in her favor. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Helping people in marginalized communities is the only reason I am doing this. It's my entire mission. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ:  Up next for today's 10 out of 10, we're showing you a volcano that's erupt to no good. Yeah, even I've got to get in on the puns here. Come on. Check out this time lapse video of the Kilauea volcano erupting in Hawaii the time lapse shows smoke and lava flowing all captured by the U.S. geological survey there's something truly so beautiful about this, so hot, the temperature. As you can see the lava cooling on the surface and forming crustal plates it's fascinating science happening right in front of our eyes. Last up on the show today, you know, we got to do it. I want to give a special shout out to Kennesaw Mountain High School in Kennesaw, Georgia. That's where I went. Go Mustangs. It's been amazing hanging out with you all today. I'm Omar Jimenez. This is CNN 10. Have a great Thursday. END230113

OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. I'm Omar Jimenez, filling in for Coy Wire today. We made it to Friday. It is Friday the 13th, but Friday nonetheless. And you already know Fridays are amazing. This is CNN 10 and I'm so excited to be right here with you. Let's finish this week strong. Now, we're going to start today with the news in Washington. Classified documents belonging to President Joe Biden have been found in areas that are not authorized to store classified files. The documents which have classified markings were found at two locations inside his home in Wilmington, Delaware. Now, the files were found along with personal and political papers. The search for these documents started after similar classified docs were found at a private office of the president back in November. Now, the paperwork is from his time as vice president in the Obama administration and Biden said the documents were in a locked garage, that he was cooperating fully with the Department of Justice. Now some of the classified documents were top secret at the highest level. They were found within boxes that also contain unclassified papers that fall under the Presidential Records Act, but key questions remain unanswered about the nature of the material, including who brought these documents and what's contained in them. Last year, more than 335 documents were found at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residents, 60 of which were top secret. Republicans in Congress have accused Biden and the Justice Department of a double standard. Now, Donald Trump is under investigation for obstruction of justice for refusing to return the documents or at least turn them over. As of Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to look into an official Biden documents probe. Now, we're going to hear from CNN senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid who has more details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  People know I take classified documents -- classified information seriously. PAUL REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  President Biden Tuesday denied any prior knowledge of classified information uncovered late last year in a space he used while working for the University of Pennsylvania before he became president. BIDEN:  We want this to be a gathering place. REID:  CNN has learned that among the items discovered were 10 classified documents dated between 2013 and 2016, including U.S. intelligence memos and briefings materials that covered topics including Ukraine, Iran and the United Kingdom. CNN has reported that some of the materials included top secret files. BIDEN:  I was briefed about this discovery and surprised to learn that there are any government records that were taken there to that office. REID:  They were found in three or four boxes that also contained unclassified papers that fall under the Presidential Records Act, a source tells CNN. The vast majority of the boxes held personal Biden family documents, including materials about Beau Biden's funeral arrangements and condolence letters. The documents were discovered November 2nd, just six days before the midterm elections. Republicans pounced, launching investigations, comparing the discovery to former President Trump's retention of hundreds of classified documents and slamming Democrats. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  They have to eat their words but the hypocrisy -- think about this -- they've gotten away with so much for so long. This was discovered before the last election. REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA):  So if then Vice President Biden took classified documents with him and held them for years and criticized president -- former President Trump during that same time that he had those classified documents and only after it was uncovered did he turn him back. REID:  Even Trump's estranged former vice president weighed in. MIKE PENCE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT:  The handling of classified materials, a very serious issue for our nation and we ought to take it seriously. But there ought to be equal treatment under the law. REID:  But Democrats are defending Biden against any such comparison. REP. PETE AGUILAR (D-CA):  What President Biden did was disclose this to the Archives, let law enforcement know. That is exactly the way that you should handle this. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ:  All right. Ten-second trivia: Which of these historic figures was given the name "Michael" when he was born in 1929? Martin Luther King, Jr., Michael Jordan, Mark Twain, Thurgood Marshall? Michael King Jr., that was the birth name of the civil rights leader born in Atlanta, Georgia. This Monday, we celebrate the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. He was a Baptist minister and activist, and one of the most prominent leaders in the civil rights movement. King called for civil and economic rights, and an end to racism in the United States. Monday is a national holiday and we won't have an episode of our show that day. So, CNN's Dana Bash filed the following report on Dr. King's legacy on the 50th anniversary of his death. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  This is unbelievable. You look up there, it says Mason Temple, this is where Martin Luther King 50 years ago gave his incredible Mountaintop speech. SUBTITLE:  April 2, 1968, King gave an emotional speech at the Mason Temple in Memphis. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER:  I just want to do God's will. And he has allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land! BASH (voice-over):  That night, April 3rd, 1968, King checked in here, to Lorraine Motel. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He gets dressed around 5:45 and he steps outside of the balcony of room 306, and he speaks to other guests that are in the courtyard. SUBTITLE:  April 4, approximately 6:01 p.m., King was shot while standing on this motel balcony. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  At approximately 6:01, the final shot rings out. Dr. King lies mortally wounded on the balcony. He's taken from the balcony to St. Joseph's Hospital and he's pronounced dead at 7:05 p.m. SUBTITLE:  On the night of King's assassination, President Lyndon B. Johnson addressed the nation. LYNDON B. JOHNSON, FORMER PRESIDENT: Shocked and saddened by the brutal slaying tonight of Dr. Martin Luther King. I ask every citizen to reject the blind violence that has struck Dr. King, who lived by nonviolence. SUBTITLE:  Fifty years later, a bipartisan group of members of Congress visited the site where MLK Jr. was assassinated. REP. KEITH ELLISON (D), MINNESOTA:  To me, it's like a return into something rudimentary and fundamental. I mean, this is where Martin Luther King breathed his last breath. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In honor of, Lorraine Hotel decided not to recheck this room out in Dr. King's honor and remembrance. BASH:  This is exactly how it was left? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was left this way. BASH:  Right there when it all happened, King's partner and dear friend, Reverend Ralph Abernathy, his wife Juanita on this pilgrimage 50 years later. The night that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, you were with his widow. JUANITA ABERNATHY, FRIEND OF KING FAMILY:  Yes. BASH:  Tell me about that. ABERNATHY:  I told Coretta, I said, well, I'll meet you in your house, and I stayed there that night with her -- BASH:  So, did you sleep with her in her bed to comfort her? ABERNATHY:  Yes, right? BASH:  The night that her husband was killed? ABERNATHY:  The night that he died, I slept on his side of the bed and my little children were there with her children. (SINGING) BASH:  Tell me how you're feeling. I was watching you standing here. REP. JOHN LEWIS (D), GEORGIA:  Well, you know, it's very emotional to come here. I was not here that evening. He changed my life.  He inspired me to stand up, to speak up and to never give up. And when he died, I think something died in all of us. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ:  And lastly, we can't go until we do it, I want to give a special shout-out to Western Middle School in Auburn, Michigan. It's been such a pleasure getting to host CNN 10 for all of you. The show meant a lot to me when I was in high school. My first ever interaction with CNN was actually visiting this program and so it's a real full circle moment for me to be back here hosting for all of you. Hope your week was awesome. Have a great weekend and I hope to see you soon. END230116

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Terrific Tuesday to you. I hope you had a wonderful weekend and a marvelous Martin Luther King Jr. Day yesterday. I am back. My voice mostly back. Thanks for all the love and well wishes on my Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok. And special thanks to the Army JROTC program at Klein Cain High School in Klein, Texas. The Hurricane Battalion sent this lovely letter, and they also sent their school colors and their pride in the form of this tie. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, and we start with the dilemma over the rapidly approaching debt ceiling for the United States government. What's the debt ceiling? It's the limit the total amount of money that the U.S. government has authorized to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations, which include Social Security, Medicare benefits, military salaries, interest on national debt and tax refunds. That credit limit currently sits at about $31.3 trillion. Now, the debt ceiling can be raised, and it has been for decades hits the massive current debt. It was last raised in December of 2021, and is expected to last until at least July of this year. Well, this has set up a major battle on Capitol Hill between the Republican and Democratic Parties. Can the two sides agree to terms on which the debt ceiling could be raised again? Here's CNN anchor and chief business correspondent Christine Romans with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  We'd like to get a debt ceiling done in this work period. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  So, when it comes to the debt ceiling, it should not -- it should not be used or never be a matter of political brinksmanship. JANET YELLEN, SECRETARY OF TREASURY:  It's really up to Congress to raise the debt ceiling. CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Ah, the debt ceiling, the eternal Washington food fight. So what is it? And why is it so contentious? The debt ceiling is the legal limit set by Congress on how much money America can borrow. Because the U.S. spends more than it takes in, it borrows to make up the difference. The debt ceiling caps how much. The problem is, it's not enough. So, every once in a while, Congress needs to raise it. If it doesn't, the Treasury Department won't be able to pay all the country's bills in full and on time. Now the Treasury does have a little wiggle room before it gets to that point, what it calls extraordinary measures to move money around. But eventually, the accounting tricks run out and there's no more avoiding the debt ceiling. That's when the fireworks usually break out. REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY):  Our debt is out of control. I mean, we're talking about over $30 trillion. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA):  Me? I get rid of the debt ceiling altogether. It serves no function except to create leverage. REP. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX):  Look, they're difficult political times. Nobody likes them but they are necessary evils in a sense because it's the only time that you can actually negotiate ways to get our budget under control. ROMANS:  Now, many say raising the debt ceiling is just a license to spend more money and grow the debt but it's not really raising the debt ceiling just lets treasury pay the bills America already owes. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  There's nothing to do with any new spending. ROMANS:  If Congress really wants to clamp down on debt, it has to do it a lot earlier like before passing spending bills or tax cuts, both of which can add to deficits. Failing to raise the debt ceiling won't keep a lid on debt. It just risks the U.S. defaulting on its obligations something that could forever stain America's global reputation. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In 2005, the British travel company used an unscientific formula to determine what kind of day of the year? Best for shopping, the most depressing, the shortest, or the worst for traffic? Blue Monday as they called it was supposed to indicate the most depressing day of the year and it typically fell on the third Monday in January. Well, yesterday was the third Monday in January and while Blue Monday is a myth, some still use the marker to predict when travel purchases may peak as people are looking to escape the cold temperatures for a sunny vacation destination. The winter blues though, those can be very real. Ever hear of seasonal affective disorder? Our Dr. Sanjay Gupta tells us all about it and gives us some tips on how to make the most of the winter months and to help us find our happy place amid the wintertime grind. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Even if you love the cold and winter sports, you've got to admit, this has felt like a long winter. At least 12 million Americans suffer from something known as seasonal affective disorder or SAD, numbers probably even higher than that. Longer nights, shorter days, all of that leads to a chemical imbalance in the brain. What happens is your serotonin levels are down and melatonin, which makes you sleepy, that's up. To make sense, symptoms can be mild or severe, you can get fatigue, lack of energy over sleeping, difficulty concentrating, and also cravings for food that cause weight gain. That probably sounds familiar as well. Diet and exercise can always help. Also, get outside as much as you can. You can also get a specialty designed light box. You just sit there and stare at it for a while each day or at least put it on your desk, the point is you can get a boost of more natural light. Another tidbit, find things that bring you joy -- open up the blinds in your house, play some of your favorite music, and be with your family. Laughter and togetherness are always great therapy for the winter blues. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, is sinking into the ocean. So, the government of Indonesia has decided to build a completely new capital city in a completely different location. But at what cost? Aside from the estimated billion-dollar price tag for the futuristic smart city that the government officials are calling the world's most sustainable, critics say that the impact on the wildlife, ecosystem and indigenous people could be devastating. More now from CNN international correspondent Kristie Lou Stout. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LOU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Jakarta is a sinking city, scientists say the sprawling capital of Indonesia, home to more than 10 million people is dropping below sea level at alarming rates, mainly due to excessive groundwater extraction. The government of Indonesia has a plan, to carve a new capital city called Nusantara, out of the dense jungles of eastern Borneo. At an estimated cost of more than $30 billion, it's being designed as a futuristic smart city and touted by government officials as the world's most sustainable. JOKO WIDODO, INDONESIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  The development of the new capital has to become a move towards building cities that are healthy, efficient and productive, that are designed to be a place where the people are close from any destination, where they can bike and walk everywhere because there are zero emissions. STOUT:  Officials describe the new capital as a sort of Garden of Eden, built along the contours of the natural landscape. Nusantara is expected to be completed in 2045, and the government says it will be more than three and a half times the size of Singapore and home to nearly 2 million people. Officials and developers claim it will have minimal impact on surrounding rainforests that are some of the oldest in the world. SOFIAN SIBARANI, ARCHITECT:  We have in our -- in our guidelines is all the building, especially key buildings or government building needs to be green, green building. It needs to be sensitive to the environment. It's also futuristic. It's a future -- smart city, smart government, smart society, smart infrastructure. STOUT:  But some environmentalists disagree, warning of a potential habitat destruction. AGUS BEI, MANGROVE ACTIVIST (through translator):  The area is unique with its natural habitats and native species, and if its mangrove forests are destroyed, all the native species will be gone, too, and the next generations can only hear the stories about the species because they don't exist anymore. STOUT:  There is another concern about the project: the potential displacement of indigenous tribes. SIBUKDIN, BALIK TRIBE LEADER (through translator):  The land and the farms are inherited from our ancestors. The land is the biggest asset of our tribe. For us, the farm is the source of life. If our land is taken away, how could we farm? How could we live? STOUT:  To that, the government has said it will compensate landowners, and there are also some critics who say Indonesia should concentrate on fixing the problems in Jakarta arguing millions of residents will remain in the current capital struggling to cope with pollution traffic and worsening floods. DORINA POJANI, UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND:  Will it relieve congestion in Jakarta? Will it make whoever is left behind in Jakarta get to live a bit better? Well, I don't think so. STOUT:  As construction ramps up this year, many questions remain. But one thing is clear the road to creating Nusantara, Indonesia's shining city on a hill, will likely be an uphill climb. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. Today's 10 out of 10 is pandastic. Some baby pandas were having a tough time getting their bearings out of giant panda research and breeding habitat in southwest China. These cute cubs were tumbling, stumbling and rumbling. For all you teachers out there with toddlers or any of you with baby brothers or sisters, you know exactly the type of stress these researchers were feeling. My goodness. Pandemonium. All right. Now, shout out time. This one goes out to Washington middle school in Miles City, Montana. Rise up. I leave you with words of motivation today, one of my favorite Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. quotes in honor of yesterday's national holiday. If you can't fly, then run. If you can't run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward. Keep moving forward y'all. No matter what you're going through, you'll come out through on the other side a little bit stronger. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. END230118

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Today is January 18th, National Thesaurus Day, and we are happy, merry, mirthful, elated, ecstatic, enthusiastic, geeked up, on cloud nine, and tickled pink to be part of your day for the best 10 minutes in news. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. We have an awesome show for you today, so let's get going. We start by getting caught up on what's happening in the economy, specifically the job market. This past year, rising inflation and high interest rates made some economists fearful of a potential recession which among other things would make it difficult for people to find jobs. But in 2022, the labor market held steady with the economy adding more new jobs than many people expected. But what about 2023. Let's take 10 to break it down by the numbers. In November, there were 10.46 million available jobs in the United States, and while that was slightly fewer than the 10.51 million jobs available in October, there were still 1.7 job openings for each job seeker. Also, the Great Resignation is not over. Americans quit 4.2 million jobs and that figure was 2.6 million prior to the pandemic. We'll hear now from CNN business anchor and chief business correspondent Christine Romans who's with us to contextualize all the hows and whys of the current job market, especially in its uh recent headlines of all the layoffs that are happening across so many industries. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  It seems like every day brings another round of layoff announcements, especially in tech. Amazon, Meta, Twitter, Salesforce, Lyft, all among the companies cutting jobs. Media companies are laying off workers, too. Even consumer giants like Walmart and Pepsi are reportedly trimming staff. At the same time, the overall job market though is in desperate need of workers. There are more than 10 million job openings in the United States, about 3 million more than before the pandemic. Weekly unemployment claims are low and hiring remains robust. So, what's really going on in the job market? High profile headlines about tech layoffs don't tell the whole story. The industry hired aggressively during the pandemic and now, it's scaling back. NELA RICHARDSON, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ADP RESEARCH INSTITUTE:  It's important to note that tech is a very small percentage, 2 percent, of the overall labor market. So, tech is not a bellwether for the real economy or for the labor market. ROMANS:  Other sectors like leisure and hospitality and healthcare are much bigger, and they're still adding jobs. Those companies want to hang on to their workers, not fire them. The question now is whether the job market can stay strong. The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates to slow the economy, as it tries to fight inflation, and the Fed chief himself admits that's going to cost jobs. JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  There will be some softening in labor market conditions, and I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability. There isn't, and this is the best we can do. ROMANS:  For Powell, slaying the inflation dragon is the priority even if it means losing jobs. The Fed predicts the unemployment rate will rise to 4.6 percent by the end of the year. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, heroes don't always wear capes. We're getting a rare behind-the-scenes look into health and safety measures that recently saved an NFL player's life. Damar Hamlin of the Buffalo Bills suffered cardiac arrest in the middle of a game two weeks ago. And within seconds, medical professionals, heroes were at his side. Our Dr. Sanjay Gupta takes us to meet the NFL's chief medical officer for a detailed look at all the precautions taken, all the product protocols that are in place to protect players in America's most popular sport. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Dr. Allen Sills is the chief medical officer of the NFL. He's giving me a sideline view of the preparedness that goes into every game day. And once you see this, you'll probably never watch a game the same way again. You may have missed this pop-up blue tent. It's on every sideline. DR. ALLEN SILLS, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, NFL:  It's like a medical exam room. We've kind of made this a medical space, even in the middle of a very busy stadium. It's just so much easier to do things in here because like I said, everybody is just more relaxed. You don't have the cameras. You don't have the fans. GUPTA:  Or this, the injury review screen. SILLS:  So, we can be down here on the sideline and the spotter's booth, if they've seen an injury video, they'll queue it up for us, put on the video exactly what we need to see. We can talk to them. GUPTA:  The spotter's booth, they are the eyes in the sky. Hey. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Welcome, welcome. GUPTA:  Thank you. SILLS:  This is another part of our game day medical preparations. The real goal of this booth is to help spot any injuries or illnesses on the field. It can be hard to see the whole field from down there. GUPTA:  Right. SILLS:  Probably, to me, one of the most unique things in sports is the spotter can directly communicate down to the referee. These people can stop the game. SUE STANLEY-GREEN, CERTIFIED ATHLETIC TRAINER SPOTTER:  So, we watch every -- every play, probably minimally four times, and then we'll go back and watch it again. And so, you know, we just want to make sure we don't miss anything. SILLS:  It's always about the right people, the right plan and the right equipment. We have almost 30 medical professionals and everyone has a job to do. GUPTA:  ER doctors, orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, paramedics, X-ray techs and air-way specialists, like Dr. Justin Deaton. DR. JUSTIN DEATON, NFL AIRWAY MANAGEMENT PHYSICIAN:  So, this is the bag that I carry, and it's got a number of things that we could use. The first thing is a portable video laryngoscope. We have a portable ultrasound machine that we can use, and we also have the ability to perform surgical airways. I really have all the resources available here that I would have in an emergency room. GUPTA:  What's the biggest challenge of that scenario versus being in an emergency room? DEATON:  Well, the biggest challenge is the external environment and the chaos of the situation. When you have a larger than average size person that's lying flat on the ground and not able to be elevated to a certain level with extra equipment, plus cameras and other people around, those are really the things that make -- make it more difficult to manage. GUPTA:  How does everyone know you're the guy in charge? DEATON:  I wear a red hat on the sideline. But that signifies me as the emergency physician, the airway physician, so even the other team knows when I come out what my role is. DR. KEVIN KAPLAN, HEAD TEAM PHYSICIAN, JAGUARS:  If a player needs to get taken off of the field, the ambulance is going to be in the tunnel to your right. If you need anything at all, we'll be out there for you guys if you need us. Otherwise, I hope we have a safe and healthy game. Good luck. GUPTA:  Keep in mind, the medical team was able to get to Damar Hamlin within ten seconds. And speed really matters here. Every additional minute that someone in cardiac arrest goes without CPR, mortality goes up by up to 10 percent. SILLS:  This is a process that's in place for every single game and we train in the offseason, and just like the players train and practice, we do as well. So, I have tremendous confidence, but you always want to see a game with no injuries, and you want everyone to, frankly, be bored on the medical side. That's a good game from my standpoint. GUPTA:  I hear you. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Yakutsk, widely considered the coldest city on the planet, is located in what country? Canada, Russia, Norway or Mongolia? Located in the Russian province of Siberia, temperatures in Yakutsk have reached minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit this week. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANASTASIA GRUZDEVA, LOCAL RESIDENT (translated):  I have two mittens, two scarves. Warm shoes is a must. And you need to cover your head. SUBTITLE:  The temperature in Yakutsk, Siberia has dropped to -50 degrees Celsius. Residents of the city, known as one of the coldest on Earth, shared how they're managing the frost. GRUZDEVA:  Also, warm trousers, because the biggest heat loss is in the leg area. If your legs are cold, you are cold. REPORTER (translated):  Apart from dressing up warm, any other life hacks? NURGUSUN STAROSTINA, FISH SELLER (translated):  No, just dress warmly, in layers. Like a cabbage. ALYONA ZAITSEVA, FISH SELLER (translated):  We are freezing. But thanks to the customers we are on the move, so we warm up this way. TRANSLATED:  The mining city in Russia's Far East is experiencing an abnormally long cold snap but temperatures regularly drop below minus 40. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10 story, we're taking a trip to Wisconsin's highway 35 to meet Jeffrey the giant snowman. And Jeffrey's snow joke. He's 58 feet tall. That's more than four stories high. Drivers there are trying to keep their cool but Jeffrey freezes traffic to a halt with tons of people coming from hours away to get a glimpse and to take selfies with them -- an incredible feat by Craig Carlson and his two sons Beau and Hunter. They named Jeffrey the snowman after a loved one that passed away. Now that just melts my heart. All right. You already know what time it is. West Milwaukee Intermediate School in Milwaukee Wisconsin, we see you. Thanks for subscribing and commenting on our CNN YouTube channel. Before we go, it's #YourWordWednesday. So put your challenge word in the comment section of my most recent post @CoyWire on Insta, Snapchat and TikTok, and we're going to choose one fun word to work into tomorrow's show. I'm Coy Wire.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Welcome to CNN 10 and happy Friday Eve. It's your boy Coy. And the challenge words from your #YourWordWednesday were awesome, and this week ends with an OUS. It means beautiful. So, see if you can catch it. All right. We got a rendezvous with the news starting now and we begin in China, the most populated country on the planet. But for the first time in years, it recorded a population decline the last time deaths outnumbered births in China was during a great famine in 1961. A huge population has enabled China to produce a huge cost competitive workforce catapulting their economy's growth and this current population decline though is happening at the same time China saw its worst annual economic performance in half a century, and it's despite the government encouraging people to have more children. So, what could this mean for the global superpower? Well, China's elderly population currently makes up a fifth of its 1.4 billion people, with the number expanding to 280 million. And over the next several decades the number of people aged 65 and above is projected to surpass China's working age population and that would mean further impending troubles potentially for China's economy and their ability to grow. More now from CNN international correspondent Marc Stewart on what else this could mean for China and the global economy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The headline is significant. China's population shrank last year, the first time this has happened in more than 60 years, a decline of about 850,000 people. Let's break this down and look at some of the reasons why. First, priorities are changing. We're getting married later and some young people are not having children at all. In addition, Beijing held a controversial one-child policy until 2015, but it was relaxed because of concerns about the population. In 2021, three children were then allowed, and a plan was released to strengthen maternity leave and to offer tax deductions. In addition to all of this, the cost of living in China is high, so is education. And then there's just general economic uncertainty, that can all impact decision making. So, what are the takeaways from this? The United Nations is predicting India will surpass China to become the most populated country this year. And then there are the economic implications. This means an aging workforce without a pipeline into the future that could impact productivity and in turn economic success. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has raised these demographic challenges saying boosting birth rates and addressing the cost of raising a child will be part of future policy. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these words comes from a Latin term meaning bird? Auto, aerial, avian, or able? Avian is your answer here. It can be traced all the way back to a Latin word avis meaning bird. Did you know there's currently an egg shortage and now the prices of eggs are no yolk? One of the culprits is an outbreak of the avian flu, a virus mostly affecting birds. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the average price for a dozen eggs in California is more than seven bucks. It was just $2.35 a year ago. And one of my CNN teammates Maya in New York City, she spent $12 on a dozen eggs yesterday. That's a dollar per egg y'all. At these prices, I'm not sure those omelettes are all they're cracked up to be. Here's CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich who tells us exactly what's causing the shortage and these super high prices. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In chilly Palmer, Alaska, the demand for chickens and their eggs is heating up. DOON DYER, OWNER, POLARIS FARM:  I was already sold out even before the egg shortage. I was - I was selling everything I had. YURKEVICH:  If you've been to the grocery store recently, you may have noticed fewer eggs and higher prices, up about 11 percent last month on average from November, up nearly 60 percent in the last year. $11.49 for a dozen eggs in New York, $10.99 in Hawaii. SHANTEL ROLDAN, MANOA, HI RESIDENT:  I think it's ridiculous for it to be that much. YURKEVICH:  The highly pathogenic avian influenza, or avian flu, is largely to blame. Nearly 58 million birds and climbing have died across 47 states in the last year, a result of the deadly virus. Wild birds can carry the disease and spread it to domestic flocks when they migrate. CHELSEA CARRIGAN, OWNER, RED BARN FARM:  One wild bird coming into their chicken run and the next thing you know, 10 birds, 20 birds, 30 birds, they're just dropping dead. YURKEVICH:  Some states now recommending that all poultry be maintained indoors. Poultry and bird shows, canceled. And biosecurity around chickens, strictly enforced. SARAH SCHNEIDER, OWNER, EGG SHOP:  The avian flu is serious. YURKEVICH:  Egg Shop, with two cafes in New York City, is struggling with prices on their main ingredient. The fall migration of wild birds sent avian flu cases spiking again. SCHNEIDER:  We go through 7,000 to 9,000 eggs a week. So, it's a significant amount of eggs. And in the last couple weeks they've jumped as high as 60 percent. YURKEVICH:  How have you been able to absorb the high price increases of eggs? SCHNEIDER:  Unfortunately, we have raised all of our prices about 10 percent on our menu items. YURKEVICH:  For some, the increased cost is too much. Baked after Dark bakery in Nebraska will close its doors this weekend. STACEY JOHNSON, OWNER, BAKED AFTER DARK:  I think about what our family could afford to pay for a cookie. I take that into consideration. We can't charge $5 a cookie. YURKEVICH:  The ripple effect goes beyond restaurants and bakeries. Take a look around the grocery store. Items that use eggs, like mayonnaise, are up 11.8 percent in the last year. ANGELO PULEO, SUPERVISOR, MORTON WILLIAMS SUPERMARKETS:  From the flu to the increases in inflation, all combined together with the shortage, it is the perfect storm. VERA NEWHOUSE, NYC SHOPPER:  And I definitely have seen the prices shoot up recently. YURKEVICH:  Does that stop you from making the purchase? NEWHOUSE:  No, not at all. I'm just buying things to make a chicken cutlet. And you need eggs as the basis for that too. It's one of the reasons why there's no way not to purchase them. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, we're headed to Australia where every year in the Great Barrier Reef, corals spawn following a full moon. This is crucial because scientists said that rising temperatures have led to bleaching, and more than percent of the reefs surveyed last year. Coral that was once vibrant with pulchritudinous colors they're now colorless. Well, that does not mean though that the coral is dead just yet and a new technique just might bring the beauty back. Let's head down under the waves Down Under to learn more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUBTITLE:  For the past three years, researchers have used the annual spawning to test a restoration method called "coral seeding". CATHIE PAGE, AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF MARINE SCIENCE:  Coral spawning is the once in a year opportunity to replenish. So, it's a really valuable time for the reef but also a really important time for us to do our research. We allow coral lobby to settle onto 3D printed structures that we then deploy to the reef, and it's an opportunity for us to boost the number of very young corals on the reef and potentially boost rates of recovery on those reefs in the future. They have some protective features that might stop fish from biting them or algae from over growing them or sediment from settling on them. SUBTITLE:  So far, the technique has exceeded expectations. PAGE:  We're building year on year on our research in this area, trialing different designs one year and then building on those in the next. SUBTITLE:  The scientists seeded hundreds of corals during the reef's 2022 mass spawning. They hope their research will help restore reefs in Australia and eventually worldwide. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And today's story getting a 10 out of 10, a mirrored mirage and a camouflaged crib in Joshua Tree National Park. They call it the invisible house, 5,000 square feet of sleek design, mirrored on all sides blending into the topography like a chameleon, by reflecting the desert landscape and skies almost playing tricks on your eyes. But the inside, look at this, look at these views. From almost every single room in the house, absolutely stunning. And that's not all, there's a swimming pool inside that's 100 feet long. The invisible house has been a popular rental for lots of celebrities but now this southern California home can be all yours for a cool $18 million. Speaking of California, let's stay right there for our shout out today. Truckee High School in Truckee, California, we see you. And we hope you and everyone watching around the world can be a reflection of all that's beautiful or pulchritudinous in this world. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and I'll see you tomorrow. END230120

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. We made it. The weekend is upon us, and you already know Friday's rock. I'm Coy. This is CNN, and we are pumped to be right here to finish this week's strong with you. Let's start today by heading to Peru, the third largest country in south America after Brazil and Argentina is made up of a variety of landscapes from mountains to beaches. The multicultural nation considered the archaeological capital of South America has a population of million people. But recently, Peru is seeing some of its worst political violence in decades. It started last month with the removal of its former president and the protests have been so intense that people have lost their lives amid the violent clashes. The citizens aren't just protesting the most recent change in government. They're also upset about the political system that's governed the -- for the last 20 years. The people at the center of the protests are from the Andean regions, which are more rural and remote, away from big cities. Many experts say the protests illustrate deep divisions within this diverse country. More now from Stefano Pozzebon reporting on this story for CNN International. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN INTERNATIONAL:  Peru is seeing some of its worst violence in recent decades after the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo has led to protesters throughout the country to call for political change, particularly in the south where dozens of people have been killed in clashes with the police. But these protests are about so much more than former President Castillo. Peru has been experiencing a deep political crisis for years. The current president, Dina Boluarte, is the sixth head of state in less than five years and even if she were to go like some of the protesters are now demanding a solution to the crisis is hard to see. Both the presidency and Congress are widely discredited and are perceived as corrupted institutions. Only 21 percent of Peruvians said that they are satisfied with Democratic rule in the 2021 poll by LAPOP, a survey research laboratory at Vanderbilt University. And on one in two Peruvians, I think that the military takeover is justified when corruption is high. Even though the country has experienced an economic boom in recent years, the expectations of better living conditions have not been fulfilled. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Peru has recorded the highest per capita death toll in the world and according to the United Nations, over half of the population lack access to enough food. Many people simply think that the system is not working for them. Boluarte has so far resisted calls for early general elections and has declared a state of emergency in the areas of the country that have been most affected by the protest. The attorney general has opened an inquiry into Boluarte's handling of the unrest, and it's hard to predict how the situation will be in the near future. However, even if khan were to be restored in Peru, the root causes of this crisis still need to be addressed. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia of the three major mountain ranges in the United States, which is considered the oldest? Rocky Mountains, Appalachian Mountains or the Sierra Nevada? Appalachian Mountains is your answer here, home to America's longest hiking-only trail they're thought to have been formed around 480 million years ago. Let's go to the Appalachia Region now, home to more than 25 million Americans. The area extending from Mississippi to New York, known for its mountain terrain, relies heavily on the mining, forestry and agricultural industries. Recently though, a new industry has become a concern for some residents, the crypto mining industry, and mostly the noise pollution it creates. We'll hear now from CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir who recently traveled to Murphy, North Carolina, to speak with residents who pushed back when the sound of silence was replaced with the sound of cryptocurrency. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This is the sound of Green Mountain Farm. Certified by Quiet Parks International as one of the most peaceful spots in North Carolina. Thanks to their rare local enforcement of laws against noise pollution. Meanwhile, about 90 minutes away, beautiful Cherokee County sounds like this. It is stack upon stack of computer servers, and the fans needed to cool them. This is what's known as a crypto mine. And it makes the sound of people in San Francisco trying to make virtual money. WEIR:  How do you describe that noise? MIKE LUGIEWICZ, MURPHY RESIDENT:  We're probably sitting at probably 65 decibels right now. When it's at about 75, 80 decibels, I'd say a jet engine. A jet engine that never leaves. WEIR:  Sixteen months after the mine fired up without warning, Mike Lugiewicz put his house up for sale in frustration. TOM LASH (ph), MURPHY RESIDENT:  There would be turkeys out in the field and deer by the hundreds. WEIR:  Yes. LASH:  You don't have that anymore. WEIR:  While Tom Lash (ph) misses the wildlife -- PHYLLIS CANTRELL, MURPHY RESIDENT:  You don't sleep at night. WEIR:  -- Phyllis Cantrell says she feels trapped. CANTRELL:  You can actually lay your head on the pillow and hear it hum up through the walls. WEIR:  No way. Have you thought about moving? CANTRELL:  We're 73 years old. Where are we going to go? WEIR:  Imagine a game where the dice have a billion sides and the first person to roll a ten wins. That is essentially crypto mining. And to play that games these days, you need computers, thousands of computers running 24/7, 365. And after China outlawed crypto currency and crypto mining, more and more mines like this began popping up in Appalachia, places where the power is cheap, and the regulations are either nonexistent or unenforced. The mine has upended local politics. JUDY STINES, MURPHY RESIDENT:  I like to be behind the scenes, and I - I like to stir the pot. And I knew that we -- we needed to win an election. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Forget the noise -- WEIR:  Outrage over the mine helped flip the balance of power in November's county election. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Homegrown U.S. Senator Thom Tillis. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I do. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Congratulations. WEIR:  With the new board of commissioners now asking for federal help in ending American crypto mining. When asked over LinkedIn for reaction, Chandler Song, one of the mine's co- owners wrote, oh, boy, they wanted us so bad a year ago. As for the proposed ban, it is unconstitutional to say the least. Song and his crypto mining co-founder made Forbes 30 under 30 list a few years ago and recently claimed quarterly revenues of more than $20 million. But when asked follow-up questions, Song went silent. His mine in Murphy has not, so far. But the county attorney is looking for a legal way to shut it down. A cautionary reminder that the next time you hear a place as peaceful as Green Mountain Farm -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You're playing roulette with their lives. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's torture. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Come on. WEIR:  -- chances are someone got loud and fought for it. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEIR:  And for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, an artist that can recreate almost exact replicas of iconic marble sculptures. Here's the thing, the artist is a robot, Italian tech company Robotor created a 13- foot-tall stone chisel in Michelangelo Bernini wannabe that's recreating a famous 19th century Italian sculpture here. The 3D scans are used to analyze, assess and then carve away. The company says recreations are 99 percent faithful to the original. One thing's for sure though, they'll never completely be able to replicate the human touch. This brings to mind a thought I'd like to leave you with this week the type of person you'll become isn't determined by what you do, but how you do it. Carry love, peace and happiness with you into this weekend. And shout-out to Roland-Story Middle School in Roland, Iowa. Go Norseman! Remember, you are all more powerful than you know. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. It's been a blessing to spend this week with you. END230123

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello and happy Monday. I hope you had an awesome weekend and you're ready to start this week strong.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10 and I'm in Buffalo, New York, for yesterday's NFL playoff action. We start today, though, with news from the White House. On Friday, FBI investigators found more classified material while conducting a search of President Biden's Wilmington, Delaware home. This comes two weeks after it was first reported that classified documents were found at Biden's private office and then later again at his home in Delaware.  Also on Thursday, President Biden said there was nothing more to this a special counsel investigation has been appointed to look into the situation and here's why. According to the Presidential Records Act, presidential records belong to the government and must be given to the National Archives at the end of a president's term. The documents in this case date back to win then Vice President Biden worked for the Obama administration. After the discovery of the documents, the president's lawyers say they've given the documents to the government and are fully cooperating with the National Archives.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're fully cooperating looking forward to getting this resolved quickly. I think you're going to find there's nothing there. I have no regrets. I'm following what the lawyers have told me they want me to do. It's exactly what we're doing. There's no there there.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  This situation draws comparison to former President Donald Trump who is also under legal scrutiny for the scoring of classified documents at his home in Florida.  More now from CNN White House correspondent Jeremy Diamond. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Six more classified documents have been found at President Biden's Wilmington, Delaware residents. This time, they were found by FBI agents who were searching President Biden's home with the president's permission, the permission of his legal team. And with the supervision of a personal attorney to the president as well as a representative of the White House counsel's office. Now, all of this was revealed on Saturday night by Bob Bauer, the president's personal attorney who confirms that the FBI carried out a nearly 13-hour search of the president's Wilmington residence on Friday from 9:45 in the morning until around 10:30 at night. And those six documents being found of following an exhaustive search of the president's residence, the entire residence, we're told, they were given access to. Instead, this was done with the permission and the cooperation of President Biden's legal team.  But nonetheless, this is the fifth time in the last two weeks that we have learned of classified documents being found initially, it was, of course, at the president's former office in Washington for the Penn Biden Center. And then, of course, there was the discovery of documents at the President's Wilmington residence, and additional documents have since been discovered at that home or revealed since then. And that drip, drip, drip has certainly been problematic for a White House that has been insisting as the president did just days before this revelation, that there is no there there, insisting that he was surprised by the revelation of these documents and certainly a president who's trying to get past all this who hopes that the special counsel can do its work quietly, and ultimately exonerate him. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia:  Which of these terms refers to a group of chickens? Brood, pod, caravan, or troop? Brood is your answer here, though flock and peep are also terms used to describe a group of chickens. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  As we mentioned last week, an outbreak of the avian flu a virus affecting mostly birds is causing an egg shortage and it's a big reason why egg prices have surged. Well, I'm going to let you know about one solution some folks have found, more and more people are getting their yolks in their own backyard.  Having your own flock of chickens may be an excellent way to save some money, but some people are questioning the safety aspect and are being critical of the noise it can make for their neighbors. CNN correspondent Gabe Cohen has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GABE COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Every morning, Cassidy O'Donnell fetches a feast from her Pennsylvania yard. Fresh eggs from eight chickens, an idea she hatched last spring, as food prices surged.  CASSIDY O'DONNELL, CHICKEN OWNER:  We've seen that the price of eggs have gone up quite a bit. Now they've gotten even more expensive. So, grateful for the decision that we made a year ago.  COHEN:  The price of eggs is up a rotten 60 percent in a year, largely driven by a deadly avian flu outbreak across 47 states that's left some store shelves empty, inspiring more Americans to invest in backyard chickens, hoping to save some scratch.  MIKE HIGMAN, OWNER, MY PET CHICKEN:  What we're seeing right now is a wake up call from a lot of our customers.  COHEN:  Mike Higman owns My Pet Chicken, which sells chicken supplies for backyard flocks. He says business is booming, up 80 percent this month, compared to a year ago.  MIKE HIGMAN, OWNER, MY PET CHICKEN:  We're looking at record numbers, people are saying that prices of eggs are going up in stores, and that they're out of stock. This people that are concerned with what things are going to look like for food prices and food availability over the next 12 months.  COHEN:  Rene Ruiz built this coop last May, and purchased three chickens, with eight more just hatched, concerned with the cost of feeding his family of five.  RENE RUIZ, CHICKEN OWNER:  I just don't think it's sustainable for people to continue to just pay what they're being asked to pay in the supermarket, without having an alternative, and that's what this is.  COHEN:  But his hens haven't laid their first eggs. And he's already spent more than $1,000 on this project.  Do you think this will be worth it in the long run, as opposed to just buying eggs?  RUIZ:  Yes. It's going to pay off, not only after my first year. But just long term if I continue this process.  COHEN:  But some experts are skeptical.  Do you think most families won't actually end up saving money?  DR. BRIGID MCCREA, PH.D., POULTRY SPECIALIST:  No, the numbers don't really work out.  COHEN:  Bridget McCrea is a poultry specialist that teaches chicken owners how to raise small flocks, and she's warning them not to wing it, as costs like feed, housing, equipment, electricity, and time she says can drive up the average cost of backyard eggs to more than $20 a dozen.  MCCREA:  The reality is, that you're going to spend more money on your chickens at home than you are on eggs at the grocery store.  COHEN:  But Cassidy O'Donnell says her hens are already fluffing the family's bottom line, laying roughly eight dozen eggs each month, which could cost more than $40 in a store. Instead, she's spending about 20 bucks on chicken feed.  O'DONNELL:  So, we're saving a lot having them in the backyard right now.  COHEN:  And she expects roughly 150 eggs a month once the weather warms up, and says they'll try to sell what they can't eat.  O'DONNELL:  That's like $70 an egg at the store right now. So, yeah, we'll see a return on it.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And today's story getting a 10 out of 10 a bus for dogs. A wife/husband duo from Alaska have a dog walking business and they decided to drive around town to pick up the pups in style. CNN's Jeanne Moos takes us for a ride. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good morning Bama. JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It definitely isn't a Greyhound bus but there are hounds in it. MO THOMPSON, CO-OWNER, MO MOUNTAIN MUTTS:  Good morning, Jake. MOOS:  Nothing but dogs jumping into their assigned seats attached to leashes rather than seat belts, picking up waiting passengers with wagging tails. THOMPSON:  Good morning, Amaru (ph). Would you like a complimentary liver with your bus ride? MOOS:  Nobody said no. THOMPSON:  Jake. Dasher. Gumbo. MOOS:  This bus is better than an airline. THOMPSON:  Excuse you. You already had yours. MOOS:  The doggy boss -- THOMPSON:  Load up. MOOS:  -- is operated by Mo Mountain Mutts in tiny Skagway, Alaska. It's a husband and wife team offering dog training and dog walking. Do the dogs know their own seat? THOMPSON:  Most of them do. The new puppies don't. They'll try to just jump in any seat available. MOOS:  As they ride to outings -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, these are tangled. MOOS:  -- the bus offers the potential for entanglements. But when we watch them disembark -- oh sure, some of the passengers are rule breakers. THOMPSON:  Excuse me, ma'am, your tail is in the aisle. Ma'am, you're going to have to adjust your butt. MOOS:  But there's one seat that's off limits. THOMPSON:  Who's honking the horn? Bama? MOOS:  Bama's ready to trade her dog license for a driver's license. THOMPSON:  Excuse me, ma'am, you're not driving. Get out of my seat. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. We have two special shout-outs today. One to Ms. Bardella (ph) and her students who came up to say hello here in Buffalo. It was awesome to meet you. Also, Warwick, Rhode Island, shout-out to Whitman Junior High. We see you.  You know, I had an old teammate who used to say there's no-mentum like momentum, so let's take great energy into this day and start this week strong.  I'm Coy Wire and this is CNN 10. END230124

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, and you are awesome. We have a great show for you today, so let's get to it. We're going to begin with the news on lunar New Year. This is the year of the rabbit in Chinese culture. In China, the festivities are known as spring festival or lunar New Year because the New Year is determined by the lunar calendar. Every year, red packets of money will change hands and dragon dances will roar through the streets as people around the world usher in the New Year. The event typically results in what is considered the largest annual human migration as millions of people working and studying away from hometowns head back to reunite with family and celebrate. Lunar New Year lasts 15 days. It's an action-packed holiday with parades and fireworks and wearing red is crucial. The color red in Chinese culture is associated with luck and prosperity and, of course, we can't forget about the food. Grubbing is loving. And food is central and essential to all Chinese festivals and -- but sugary snacks man they are especially important for lunar New Year because they are said to sweeten up prospects for the New Year ahead. We'll go now to international correspondent for CNN, Marc Stewart, who has more on what lunar New Year will look like this year in China. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The lunar New Year is underway and despite a mask mandate here in Hong Kong, people are celebrating. Take a look at the iconic Victoria Harbor. People are lined up anxious to take a picture in front of the different plastic figurines. This is the year of the rabbit. There are families here. There are tourists here, all anxious to take pictures and in many cases just a few selfies. This is a big shift from last year at this time when much of Asia had a lot of restrictions, even lockdowns. In mainland China, things have opened up and as such, we have seen busy airports, busy train stations. During this roughly month-long period, it's estimated there may be as many as 2 billion individual trips out of this broader population of 1.4 billion people. While some health officials are expressing concern, the Chinese government feels that COVID has peaked in many places. As far as the year of the rabbit, it's a symbol of peace and prosperity, a wish that many people here in Hong Kong hope to share with the rest of the world. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these world heritage sites was built most recently? Machu Picchu, Great Wall of China, Chichen Itza, or Notre Dame Cathedral? Dating back to the 15th century, Machu Picchu is the youngest of these oldies but goodies. Right now, the world heritage site Machu Picchu is closed. It's among the greatest artistic and architectural sites in the world built as a legacy of the Inca civilization in Peru in the 15th century and then later abandoned. Built 2,400 meters above the sea level, the landmark site is made of approximately structures. And did you know what exactly it was used for is still a mystery to this day. This week, the government shut down Machu Picchu indefinitely as anti- government protests across the country grow. We'll hear more now from Rafael Romo, senior Latin American affairs editor of CNN worldwide, who has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR:  Peru's biggest tourist attraction, Machu Picchu, one of the seven wonders of the world Peru announced Saturday it's closing the famed site indefinitely including the Inca trail that leads up to it. Anti-government protests have choked transportation to and from the ancient citadel rail operators say they've had to suspend services because several tracks have been blocked or damaged by protests that have spread throughout the country. In the past month, dozens of people have been killed in violent clashes. The fiery protest erupting after the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo in December. Demonstrators are demanding new elections and calling for the resignation of current Peruvian President Dina Boluarte. The civil unrest has stranded tourists before. Last month, authorities evacuated hundreds of people after similar transit issues at Machu Picchu. Officials say this time around, some tourists have left by foot, but the trick is at least six to seven hours long. Machu Picchu usually draws more than a million tourists a year but it's now off limits. Peru's national treasure overshadowed by its spiraling political crisis. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, a Las Vegas family style Italian restaurant was struggling but now it has lines out the door. The owner of Frankensons Pizzeria says his dream of owning a restaurant was fading away until a local content creator Keith Lee made the restaurant an overnight sensation with one heartfelt TikTok review. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KEITH LEE, CONTENT CREATOR:  Yesterday afternoon, I got an email from an employee of a family-owned restaurant here in Vegas. I got it. Let's try it and rate it 1 to 10. SUBTITLE:  Content creator Keith Lee gave a heartfelt review after hearing from a manager at family owned Frankensons pizzeria. LEE:  Frank, if you're watching this, I'm going to be completely honest, you are an amazing man. SUBTITLE:  His viral TikTok gave the Las Vegas restaurant new life. LEE:  Let's try this food. Garlic knots off rick. These look amazing. Boy, that thing packed with flavor. I ain't going to try the ranch again because again I'm not a huge fan. This is one of the best wings I've ever had. SUBTITLE:  Lee has posted hundreds of taste testing videos, but his Frankensons review is by far the most popular, garnering 37.3 million views. FRANK STEELE, OWNER, FRANKENSONS:  So, I went out on delivery. It was just me and another girl walking that aisle because we're not busy. And the phone was just started blowing up. Come Tuesday morning, we had a long line out of our door prior to us opening up. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hey, guys how many saw this man on TikTok? (CHEERS) SUBTITLE:  Frank says prior to Keith Lee's visit, his restaurant was struggling with rent and on the brink of closing down. STEELE:  Thirty years ago, I had a dream of opening my own restaurant. Finally, this year, it came through with the help of my family. But I saw my dreams fading away because of the lack of traffic coming into my business. LEE:  That Summer, she the original employee that reached out to me. Summer, say hi. SUBTITLE:  Summer, the restaurant manager, reached out to Keith when she learned that the restaurant was close to shutting down. LEE:  The email read: I'm an employee at Frankensons pizzeria. It's really slow. We really can't afford rent and we would love for you to come and try the food. Frank, from me to you, this is my opinion. There is no way you should be behind our rent or struggling to pay rent. It is marketing. That's a hundred percent what I feel like. That food is delicious. The service is amazing. SUBTITLE:  Frank said he is overwhelmed by the onslaught of customers and hopes that the popularity will remain. STEELE:  People from everywhere and that is very emotional -- to me, but they will come out. It's support of my family and this trip is (INAUDIBLE). (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, if you love pizza, you're going to love this. Pizza Hut went to the Los Angeles Convention Center to build the world's biggest pizza. And to complete the task, workers put down layers of dough, tomato sauce, toppings then bake the enormous pie with a special heater. Let's break this pie down by the numbers. Nearly 14,000 square feet of pizza, more than thirteen thousand pounds of dough. We're talking nearly pounds of sauce and more than eight thousand pounds of cheese. At the end, it worked out to be 68,000 pieces of pizza for their record-breaking pie. And Guinness World Records confirms it's the world's biggest pizza. That is huge, for real though. Now, I'm going to be out the next two days but you're going to be in great hands, and I look forward to coming back to finish this week strong with you on Friday. I want to give a special shout out to Morton Middle School in Fall River, Massachusetts. We see you and we hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. Go out and make someone smile today. END230125

JON SARLIN, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everybody. I'm Jon Sarlin. I'm a producer for CNN. I cover tech and business, and I'm the host of the CNN business show "Nightcap". I'm so excited to be with you today filling in for Coy Wire. Thanks for having me, Coy. We got a lot of news today, let's get started. We're going to begin with the latest news on Ticketmaster. Did any of you try to get tickets for the Taylor Swift concert recently? What about your favorite sports team? Well, if you did, chances are you probably saw tickets for those events on Ticketmaster. The company promotes itself as the way to buy and sell tickets online for concerts, for sports, for theater events. But Ticketmaster is in the news this week after the Senate judiciary committee held a hearing exploring whether the merger between Ticketmaster and the giant concert company Live Nation has led to a monopoly on tickets and harmed consumers by challenging any competition. In November, you might remember, Ticketmaster halted public ticket sales of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour after a chaotic rollout of pre-sale tickets left fans scrambling and waiting hours in virtual cues for tickets, congratulations to anyone who might have gotten them. But the debacle was so bad that it did something very rare, it united members of Congress from both the Democratic and Republican Party who fear that Ticketmaster now has a monopoly, meaning that they have exclusive control of the supply of tickets. We'll hear more on this now from CNN national correspondent Jason Carroll who has more on the details of the hearing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC) JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Scores of Taylor Swift fans still haven't shaken off the bitter feeling of being shut out of the pop star's upcoming tour this month. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Ticketmaster takes the $490 out of my account but it, like, crashed. CARROLL:  All that ire directed at Ticketmaster, which bungled the pop star's ticket sales so badly last November, it left thousands facing technical issues, such as canceled tickets, a crashing site and an artist beside herself over what fans endured to get tickets. Some of those who did get them ended up paying thousands for resale tickets just to get a seat to see Swift." Now Ticketmaster is in the hot seat. Its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment's president and CFO Joe Berchtold will have to answer to a Senate Judiciary Committee about claims the Swift fallout is the result of anticompetitive conduct from a company with too much influence. SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN):  I have called for years for a change and maybe Taylor Swift fans will probably put it -- will finally put it over the edge. CARROLL:  Berchtold is scheduled to testify Tuesday. Part of his planned testimony reads: In hindsight, there are several things we could've done better. We apologize to many disappointed fans, as well as to Ms. Swift. Antitrust experts say the real issue before Congress is whether Live Nation Entertainment is a monopoly, something critics say was created in 2010 when Ticketmaster and Live Nation merged. (MUSIC) CARROLL:  While some industry insiders questioned how much one hearing is likely to change things, others say the Swift movement has already had an impact. MORGAN HARPER, AMERICAN ECONOMIC LIBERTIES PROJECT:  This is going to be the first hearing that the Senate will be holding. And it shows that this is a priority issue for folks who are on the Judiciary Committee and that they see that there are problems with the Live Nation Ticketmaster merger. (END VIDEOTAPE) SARLIN:  Next up, 10-second trivia: What region is surrounded by the Adriatic Sea, the Ionian Sea and the Aegean Sea? Is it the Balkan Peninsula, the Amazon Basin, Patagonia or Western Plateau? Well, the only option here that's surrounded by all of these features is the Balkan Peninsula in Europe. Speaking of the Balkan Peninsula, let's travel to it to the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina where one lake is experiencing an example of extreme pollution, pollution so alarming that even environmentalists are surprised. And look, ocean pollution is not unique to the Balkans, but this collection point provides a clear picture of what can end up in waterways when not managed correctly. CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar has more on this story along the Drina River where a clogged lake filled with downed trees and frozen trash is gaining attention. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Snow falls on a lake on the Drina River. From up high, it's coated with frost, but get a little closer and you can see what's underneath the veneer of snow. A massive tangle of trash clogging the waterway. Even environmentalists are surprised by what ends up here. DEJAN FURTULA, ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST (through translator):  In addition to floating waste, such as plastic, there are also various household items, including refrigerators and stoves. There's nothing that is not present. But a significant portion is also fallen trees, which are very difficult to remove. CHINCHAR:  Experts say it's a recurring problem at this spot in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are several landfills and illegal dumps near the Drina River. And after a heavy rain, the waste washes into the water and collects here. Anti-pollution barriers have been installed where the waist ends up accumulating. Local authorities say the problem will continue until there's adequate waste collection, and people dispose of their trash more responsibility. FURTULA:  In addition to posing a significant health and environmental problem, this is a source of great embarrassment for all of us. As we seem unable to solve this issue for such a prolonged period. CHINCHAR:  A lake of trash, far from what nature intended it to be. (END VIDEOTAPE) SARLIN:  Next up, we're going to talk about the future of work and what exactly that looks like. So, while many companies offered remote work and flexible and hybrid schedules during the pandemic, workers may now be entering an era of having to go back into the office. Companies from Apple to Disney to Starbucks are now requiring employees work from the office for more than half of the workweek. Last week on nightcap, my show CNN's digital show focused on business and tech news, I spoke with a CEO Ed Zitron about what workers can expect in 2023. You can also sign up for the "Nightcap" newsletter and watch the show on CNN.com with new episodes every Thursday. Let's see what Ed has to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SARLIN:  The battle over working from home has entered a new phase. Disney just threw down the gauntlet requiring workers to be in the office four days a week, beginning March 1st. Two days later, Starbucks ordered corporate employees back to the office three days a week. Other companies are enforcing mandates as well. And Jane Frazier, the CEO of Citigroup, one of the only big banks to fully embrace hybrid work, just said this at the World Economic Forum. JANE FRASER, CEO, CITIGROUP:  We do want people collaborating in and they do collaborate better together. In productivity, you can see how productive someone is or isn't, and if they're not being productive, we bring them back to the office or back to the site and we give them the coaching they need until they get their productivity back up again. SARLIN:  So, with a tight job market, workers felt like they had the power to resist mandates to return to the office. But with all the big layoffs lately in tech media and other corporate jobs, has the power shifted back to the employers? And Zitron is the founder of EZPR who has written about working from home for "The Atlantic" and his newsletter "Where's Your Ed At". So, Ed, is it over? Have we reached the tipping point where this kind of workplace tug of war has now shifted back to the employer because workers are afraid of losing their job? ED ZITRON, CEO, EZPR:  I think that there is an implicit threat from companies around this, now that there is a rockier economy that there are layoffs happening, they're basically saying, we're not going to fire you but we need you back in the office due to reasons we will probably never explain to you. The thing -- the reality is, it's not going away. Remote work is not going away, but big companies, Starbucks, Disney and so on are using their leverage here of we're a big company and you want stability to say come back in the office because it makes us happy. (END VIDEO CLIP) SARLIN:  And for today's 10 out of 10 story, this fourth-grade paleontologist made the discovery of a lifetime. On Christmas morning, while walking on a beach in Maryland, Molly Sampson discovered a massive five-inch tooth from a prehistoric Megalodon shark, meaning big tooth. The Megalodon is an extinct species of mackerel shark that lived approximately a million years ago. Molly's mom said that children around the globe have sent letters to Molly sharing their excitement at her discovery. Good job, Molly. Last up, we can't forget to give a shout out. Today's special shout out goes to Mendota High School in Mendota, California. We see you. We thank you for watching. And for you and everybody else watching around the world, I hope you have a wonderful day. I'm Jon Sarlin and it's been awesome hanging with all of you this Wednesday. Have a great day. END230126

OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's going on from New York City, everyone. I'm Omar Jimenez and I am so happy to be back here with you for another exciting day of CNN 10.  Let's get right into it. If you search for this show on the world's most popular search engine or if you're watching on YouTube, then you've used a Google product to get here. This week, Google is in the news because the U.S. Justice Department and eight states have sued Google, accusing the company of harming their competition and the online advertising market.  For years, critics have said that Google has exploited their power and thwarted any competition. They say Google has used anti-competitive exclusionary and unlawful means to create a monopoly over digital advertising and that they've acquired their rivals through anti-competitive mergers. This move is the Biden administration's first big anti-trust case against the big tech company.  The eight states span both U.S. coasts that include California, Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Virginia. And while lawmakers and regulators have express concerns about Google in the past they've failed to pass new legislation or regulations. The last antitrust complaint against Google was issued by the Trump administration in 2020. So let's hear now from CNN's Anna Stewart based in the London bureau who has more on what we can expect from Google. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Allegations that Google holds too much control are nothing new, but this latest legal broadside from the U.S. Justice Department its first major anti-trust case under the Biden administration has certainly ramped up the pressure.  Now this complaint argues that Google has actively and illegally dominated the digital advertising market for many years as detailed by the U.S. attorney general in a press conference Tuesday. MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  For 15 years, Google has pursued a course of anti-competitive conduct that has allowed it to halt the rise of rival technologies, manipulate auction mechanics to insulate itself from competition and force advertisers and publishers to use its tools.  STEWART:  Now the lawsuit accuses the tech giant of controlling too much of the ecosystem of digital advertising including three main areas. Firstly, the technology used by major website publishers to offer ad space. Secondly, the tools used by advertisers to buy that space. And thirdly, the largest automated ad exchange essentially linking the publisher with the advertiser.  The U.S. government is calling for Google to be broken up and forced to spin off at least its online advertising exchange an ad server for publishers. Google responded with a statement saying: Today's lawsuit from the DOJ attempts to pick winners and losers in the highly competitive advertising tech sector.  It goes on to say their flawed argument with slow innovation raise advertising fees and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow. Google is not new to fighting antitrust legal battles. The DOJ sued Google for its dominance in web searches in 2020. The E.U. commission launched an antitrust probe into its conduct in digital advertising last year and has already fined Google three times in antitrust cases totaling more than nine billion dollars so far. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ:  All right. Ten-second trivia. What is the currency of Russia called? The rupee, ruble, yen, or franc? It's the ruble, the basic monetary unit of the Russian Federation. We turn now to Russia's war in Ukraine. On February 24th of last year, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine and fighting there has continued in the now nearly year ever since.  On Wednesday, Ukraine received what's being called a major sign of support from the United States and Germany. The nations both announced that they're sending tanks to the front line in Ukraine. Germany plans to send 14 tanks. And the U.S. is planning to send its special Abrams tanks to Kyiv.  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called the decision a turning point in the war and President Biden in a speech said the tanks will enhance Ukraine's capacity to defend its territory and achieve its strategic objectives. The president also announced a group of 50 nations that are making other contributions in the form of military equipment and weapons. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  As you all know, I've been saying this for a long time. The expectation of the part of Russia is we're going to break up, we're not going to stay united. But we are fully, thoroughly, totally united. (END VIDEO CLIP) JIMENEZ:  And though there was no immediate reaction from Russian President Putin, a Russian ambassador called Germany's decision to send tanks in extremely dangerous decision that would take the conflict to a new level of confrontation.  We'll hear now from CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson who has more on what to expect from Russian president Vladimir Putin. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (translated):  Dear Russian citizens -- NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  Putin's biggest issue in 2023 will be feeding his war in Ukraine, both men and materiel. But a visit to an armaments producer in mid-January, he commended workers for upping output three shifts a day, 24/7. He told them they'd be exempt from call up for military service in Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands of military-aged men fled Russia last year fearing conscription.  More than 100,000 Russian servicemen already believe killed in Ukraine. It's the most unpopular feature of Putin's war so far. More recruitment may spur more resentment of him. But at the rate he burns through soldiers on the front lines means that this dilemma is only going to get worse foreign. His second biggest issue would be paying to feed the war. International economic sanctions are beginning to bite. If they chew into Russian citizens' pockets, then Putin has a problem.  The dangerous high-wire walk Putin is trying to pull off keep the value of the ruble up, keep people in jobs, it's only going to get harder. A cold winter next year, impoverished Russians on the streets risks a revolt against the war and Putin himself and this will play into Putin's long-  range concerns, an election 2024. In 2021, he signed a law allowing him to remain leader until 2036, but he has built a house of cards. Russian elections are neither free nor fair, Putin has snuffed out dissent, locked up opposition leaders, taking control of all media but even that requires mafia-style playing of Russia's power brokers against one another.  If he can't make gains in Ukraine or worse starts racking up losses, his grip on Russia's power game could weaken. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ:  For today's 10 out of 10 news, a story as old as time. The rivalry between cat and microwave? Yeah, well, we have an insane video to prove it.  So, I'm going to let CNN's Jeanne Moos explain it from here with the details of this epic story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  There was nothing micro about the epic battle waged by Bentley the cat against this microwave. He yanked it. He physically moved it. He would have certainly gotten into it if it weren't for the child lock his owners put on it to keep him out. BRITTANY SCHIESL, PET OWNER:  His body language while doing it, it doesn't seem like a cat. MOOS:  He's got this physique. He's got like a great body. Using his legs like arms, he might have pulled the microwave right off the counter if the cord weren't plugged in. No wonder this sometimes cross-eyed cat from Sheridan, Oregon, has gone viral with millions of views. Bentley has been obsessed with the microwave ever since Brittany Schiesl left pizza in it. SCHIESL:  The microwave is wide open and the pizza is on the floor and gone pretty much. MOOS:  They also had to put a lock on the kitchen cabinets where Bentley uses all four legs. Without the child lock, we clocked him getting into the microwave in eight seconds flat. Brittany says the appliance is his best friend. This story reminds me of one I did 27 years ago about Peggy the bull terrier who got into the fridge so often, his owner had to keep it locked. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And then I stick it through the hole. MOOS:  But when it's cat versus microwave, sometimes the cat moves the appliance, and sometimes the appliance moves him. (END VIDEOTAPE) JIMENEZ:  And before I go, it's time. I want to give a huge shout out to Elmira High School in Elmira, Oregon. We hope you and everyone watching there and around the world have a wonderful day.  I'm Omar Jimenez. It was so great to join you all today. See you soon. END230127

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Well, hello, you lovely people. You made it. A long week is now an almost gone week. It's Friday, and you already know Fridays rock. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10 and we're going to finish this week strong. First up, a new study on our planet. Earth rotates at about a thousand miles per hour, but new research published in "Nature Geoscience" says that the Earth's inner core may have actually stopped turning and now might start to spin in reverse. What does this mean? Well, the solid inner core of the Earth is located 3,200 miles below the crust. That's roughly the size of Mars or a third of Earth's mass. And because that core is separated from the Earth's mantle by a liquid outer core, it allows the inner core to potentially rotate at a different speed from Earth's crust. The findings explain that seismic records taken since 2009 had always shown action but they're now starting to show little difference, suggesting that the inner core's rotation has paused. The speed of the inner core's rotation and whether it varies though are debated, and at least one geophysicist not involved with this study says nothing cataclysmic is happening here. Scientists believe the spin of the inner core is driven by the magnetic field and balanced by the gravitational effects of the Earth's mantle. Knowing how the inner core rotates could shed light on how these layers interact and other processes deep in the Earth. Up next, we head to China where many families are reuniting for the first time in years. This week was the first week of lunar New Year. It's the year of the rabbit, the most important holiday in China which is widely celebrated across Asia has always prompted what has become known as the world's largest human migration, millions and millions of people returning to their hometowns to be with loved ones. But for the last three years, China has been locked down due to the country's zero COVID policy. But the nation has recently loosened its restrictions so people who work or study away from their hometowns feel free to travel again to see their family without the fear of getting locked down due to the virus. My friend Selina Wang, our CNN international correspondent, is in Beijing, giving us a glimpse of what it's like to finally be able to fully celebrate lunar New Year again. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  This year's celebration is particularly special. The adults around this table all work in factories in the cities. This is the only time when many of them can see their children. The man next to me says we got to go wherever we can make money and China's Zero COVID policy over the last three years has made it all even harder. He says the policy prevented them from going home but now that the country's open, they can all be together. We came to this place in China southern Guizhou province to see how the part of rural China is celebrating the Lunar New Year without pandemic restrictions. About 1000 people live in this village and for hundreds of years, they've lived in these traditional wooden houses, and you can hear the chickens crowing and there are these ducks as well that they raised for food. In many ways, this place is like a time capsule. Its physical isolation has preserved their way of life for centuries. They're China's Dong ethnic minority. They have their own language, tradition and culture, but they can't escape the economic realities of modernity. Normally, this village is full of the elderly and young kids with most of the working age adults gone, working in faraway factories sending money home. This couple works in a factory 500 miles away in Guangdong province, making circuit boards. He tells me he hasn't seen his kids for a year. Last time he left, his son couldn't even walk. He says it's emotional to see them grow so much. For the first time in three years, millions of Chinese migrant families are finally able to reunite without the fear of COVID markdowns. Almost everyone I speak to on camera says no one around them has gotten COVID. Like this elderly woman who makes traditional crafts. She says she has not been wearing a mask and points to her shoulder saying she had the vaccine shots. But we run into another group of young people who say otherwise. The man in the brown jacket with his back turned is a doctor at a hospital in a nearby city. He says almost all of the villagers have been infected. I asked him if they just don't realize they have COVID. In response he says they've never been tested, but clearly, they had COVID symptoms. So, we've got the three government minders following us. It's common for local officials to keep a close eye on foreign journalists in their jurisdictions. But they were especially persistent in this village following our every move. So, we drive out of the village to visit a public hospital in a neighboring county about two hours away, hoping these government minders won't follow us, so people will feel more comfortable speaking freely. We walked inside the fever clinic. It's almost entirely empty. In the main hospital area, there are more people, but it's not packed. Soon after, we've realized we're being followed apparently by a whole different crew. There are at least two, three government minders. They're still following us all the way here. It's very obvious. They followed us to hospital after hospital preventing anyone from speaking to us. I try confronting them. I asked them why they're following us everywhere. And he ignores me. He's walking away. So, I tried this official. She refuses to even acknowledge my question. And what happens next talk during my interview with this girl shocks us. OK, so just interviewing the girl and then the mind literally took her away from us. The man pushes the girl and her family away, then later leaves them alone. But her interviews in the marketplace are over. China's CDC says the COVID peak across the country has passed. But in rural areas like this, experts say there's likely far more silent suffering. Whether it's in the village or in faraway factories, they're hardworking people. They'll do whatever it takes to give their kids a better life, even if it means long bouts of separation from them, making reunions like these all the more meaningful. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What is the process where pieces of ice break away from a glacier and create an iceberg? Calving, stagnation, downwasting or foliation? Calving is the answer here and a nice shelf in Antarctica just dropped a tremendous chip off the old ice block. An iceberg that's 600 square miles broke off in Antarctica on Sunday. That's the size of two New York cities or nearly the size of greater London. This type of calving was one of the most major events we've seen in Antarctica in a long time. It broke free from one of the most closely observed ice shelves. An ice shelf is a large floating sheet of ice permanently attached to a landmass. Scientists had previously discovered cracks in this particular one, but two major breaks occurred in the last two years. Researchers say this event was expected not the result of climate change and they're going to continue to monitor its every move to ensure it's safe. (MUSIC) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 deserves a round of applause. Meet Spike, a Chihuahua mix hailing from Ohio, recently named the world's oldest living dog by Guinness World Records. Spike is 23 years old. According to American Kennel Club, a small dog that age would equate to 112 in human years. Spike's owner found her forever friend abandoned and injured in the parking lot of a grocery store back in 2009 but she says he has the attitude of a big dog, hence the name Spike. He enjoys going for walks on his family's farm, visiting the cows and horses in the barn and when he has a rough day, he enjoys his favorite treats -- sausage, cheese and Doritos. He also likes taking naps. We see you, Spike. All right. Let's take great energy into this weekend. You never know who, you never know when, you never know how, but somehow, you just might be the light someone needs this weekend. Shout out to Osborne High School in Marietta, Georgia.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Welcome back. I hope you had a great weekend. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. Here to help you kick start your week with some of the top stories of the day and having a little bit of fun along the way.  We start though with some really heavy news out of New Zealand. Record rainfall wreaking havoc on the northeastern part of the island country over the weekend. Auckland, the nation's largest city, declared a state of emergency.  Look at these scenes from the airport there which had to be closed as torrential downpours have caused major flooding with numerous evacuations in the area. Several lives have been lost. On Friday, Auckland was hit with its average amount of rainfall for the entire month of January, all in just one hour's time. New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins says it's been an unprecedented event. More now from CNN international anchor and correspondent Michael Holmes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Mud on the floor, waterlogged drawers. This is what the floods left behind in Auckland. This was someone's house full of a lifetime of possessions. Residents say it took just minutes before chest deep waters washed through it. No time to save anything except themselves. REBECCA MAGEE, RESIDENT:  I felt quite helpless, never been in that situation before. It happened real fast. HOLMES:  New Zealand's new Prime Minister Chris Hipkins inspected the damage by air and on the ground and says the cleanup will be massive.  That's because the amount of rain that fell Friday in Auckland has never reached such recorded levels in such a short amount of time. The city had its worst downpour on record a burst of about 240 millimeters of rain falling in just a few hours. The heavy rains caused flash floods, closing highways, grounding flights and stranding passengers, plunging neighborhoods underwater. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The water I think is up here, but when we're trying to open that door to swim outside. HOLMES:  The waters have since receded but there are new fears in Auckland and further south where the storm has moved. The saturated ground giving way to landslides in some areas leaving houses dangling from cliffs and backyards sliding down hills. Stunned neighbors are trying to determine the scale of the damage using the drier conditions to try to find anything salvageable from their homes. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I have been in this community my whole life, 45 years, I've never seen it like this. HOLMES:  But the brief cleanup that was started may have to be on hold as meteorologists say there is more rain in the forecast. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. Protests took place in multiple cities in the United States over the weekend after the release of a video of a police encounter that happened in Memphis, Tennessee, on January 7th.  According to a police report, Tyree Nichols was pulled over for reckless driving. After an initial confrontation, Nichols fled. He was then arrested at a second location.  But in the video, officers are seeing striking nickels repeatedly during the encounter in a manner that law enforcement analysts have described as well outside the limits of police training. Tyree Nichols died three days after the incident. The actions by these police officers have been widely criticized and rallies in cities across the nation, including New York, Atlanta, Boston and L.A. have called for the end of such abuses by authorities. All five police officers involved have been fired and charged with crimes and the police unit of which they were apart has been shut down. Lawyers for at least two of the officers say their clients will plead not guilty to the charges and that no one in ended for the 29-year-old Nichols to die. We'll hear from CNN correspondent Polo Sandoval who has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Here in the United States, it was another night of demonstrations from coast to coast in the wake of the release of the series of videos showing the beating of Tyre Nichols. On Friday night, there was one incident in Times Square where at least three arrests were reported. But outside of that, according to authorities, things have remained relatively peaceful. On Saturday night, another group of protesters coming together here in Manhattan, hoping to stand in solidarity with the Nichols family, hoping that their voice makes it to Memphis and beyond.  Here's what one of the organizers of Saturday night's event told our affiliate WCBS about why they're coming together here in New York. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are out here to fight and call for justice once again and continuously because the work did not stop in 2020, it didn't stop in 2021, and it did not stop in 2022. We are still here and we are still fighting until justice is done. SANDOVAL:  New York City's police commissioner did say that they will continue to have officers out in full force, not only making sure that citizens stay safe but also so to make sure that they protect the right for these individuals to peacefully assemble throughout the city here. They did say also that they are really expressing outrage as well after seeing the video that was released, that series of videos that was released on Friday night. It's really what we're also hearing from other police departments in other parts of the country strongly condemning what the world saw when those videos were released. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: The inaugural contest of what sports competitions was held in Big Bear Lake, California, in 1997? The Goodwill Games, Rugby World Cup, The X Games, or Winter X Games? The Winter X Games is your answer here and the 27th edition of the event was hosted this past weekend in Aspen, Colorado. Nineteen-year-old freestyle skiing phenom Eileen Gu from San Francisco won two World Cup events this past week, storming back into competition for the first time since the Beijing Winter Games, where she became the first free skier ever to win three medals at a single Olympics.  Now an injury during practice knocked her out of the X Games this weekend but Eileen told me ahead of the games how she balances being a student at Stanford University, a pro-athlete and professional model. And she's also telling us how she harnesses the power of her mind to help her shine. (BEGIN VIDEEO CLIP) WIRE:  I remember in Beijing at the Olympics, you were journaling, you were writing affirmations before half pipe, convincing yourself you weren't tired. How big of a role does training your mind play in your life? EILEEN GU, FREESTYLE SKIER:  Huge, huge role. I think that for me my biggest strength is my brain. I'm shamelessly a nerd. Everywhere I go, the reputation follows me and you know, I'll take it. I definitely propagate it out there.  And at the end of the day, I think that so much of skiing is in your own head. It's an individual sport which means that your biggest rival really is yourself and overcoming that fear being able to perform on the day, learning how to deal with pressure, these are all things that are practiced and they are behaviors that I've spent a long, long time learning about how I naturally cope with them and then trying to exacerbate my strengths. So in that sense, I do a lot of journaling. I do a lot of thinking, a lot of reflection, a lot of visualization. WIRE:  You once said your wish is to inspire young girls to break boundaries. What do you mean by that, Eileen? GU:  I mean that growing up, I think so much of what you think is possible for yourself is dependent on what you see out there in the world. It can be on TV. It can be on social media it can be what you see your friends doing. I guess it's just feeling as though you're not alone, feeling that there's a place for you in the community or in the sport that you want to participate in.  For me, growing up, there weren't that many girls in the ski industry. There were a couple and I looked up to them a bunch and they really, really inspired me. But I guess what I want to do is, you know, I'm young and I'm trying to do my best and I just want to be the person that a girl at home can see on TV or on their phone and say, hey, you know, if she can do that, then I want to try it, too.  She looks like she's having fun, when can I try? And really, that's all I want to do. I just want to be out there. I want to reflect the population that's interested in it and hopefully inspire someone to take it up. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  And for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, something unbearably cute and funny. A trail cam in Boulder, Colorado, captured about 580 photos and around of them were bear selfies. Is it possible that this black bear knew exactly what it was doing? There are all sorts of poses like the coming right at you or the stare off into the distance or how about the pretty side posts, who me? There's even a hey, look at my paw, y'all. This pabearazzi was having a ball clearly. There are roughly between 17,000 and 20,000 black bears in the state of Colorado, but none of them can strike a pose quite like this one. Hey, y'all, hey. Thank you very much for all the love on our CNN 10 YouTube Channel. We surpassed 700,000 subscribers now, so special thanks to you. And salute to South Middle School in Edinboro, Texas. You get our shout out for the day.  Let's call out today and do something to make this world a bit of a better place, even if it's just making someone smile today. I'm your boy Coy, and I'll be right here with you tomorrow. END230131

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Good morning, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you.  I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10 and we have a rendezvous with the news. So let's go. First up, today, we're heading to Ukraine. It's been almost one year since Russia's war in Ukraine began and there is no end in sight for the conflict.  This month, the United States and some of its NATO allies sent tanks to help aid the front line in Ukraine. The U.S. pledged 31 of its Abrams tanks, Poland said it will provide 60 tanks. The U.K. committed 16, Germany sent 14. In the United States, politicians in both parties called this move a turning point in the war and said that the tanks will enhance Ukraine's capacity to defend its territory and achieve its strategic objectives.  Fifty additional nations around the world are making other military contributions as well. The gesture was seen as a major sign of support, but some have criticized the decision saying it could make these NATO allies too involved in the war itself and some critics are asking if this means NATO is now directly involved in the conflict with Russia. We're joined now by CNN international correspondent Fred Pleitgen with the latest on the conflict. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Revving like a dragster, the crew from the 28th mechanized brigade warm up their Soviet-era T-64 for battle.  We have problems with ammunition, we're running low, the commander tells me. And that's the only problem we have. We get enough spare parts. Our commanders work all the time to sustain the tank and repair it.  That commander who goes by the call sign "David" races the 40-year-old beast towards the front line like a steam engine train.  A lot of Ukraine's main battle tanks are as old as this one. That's why the military says they urgently need those new Western main battle tanks. They say around three to four hundred to try and turn the tide in this war.  The problem, Ukraine is running out of Soviet-era tanks and is having increasing trouble replacing those lost in battle or needing repair. The 28th helped liberate Kherson in the south and then was sent here. It's already been a long war for this unit. Ukrainian soldiers on the front around Bakhmut are elated. Western nations are sending modern battle tanks, M1A2 Abrams from the U.S., German-made Leopard 2s and British challenger tanks.  But the Ukrainians are also masters at using the old Soviet tanks they have now to best effect. Firing, reloading, taking aim and quickly shooting again.  The tank engineer who only gave his name is Maksym says the soldiers from the 28th could operate these vehicles blindfolded.  If we fire from a covered position, we use this device, he says. It's old and analog but pretty efficient, very precise. Ukraine's forces say their tanks have been extremely important and effective here in Bakhmut. The tank commander says they're constantly working to stop Wagner's advances here.  We just fight against them. If we stop, they will come closer and we will lose our houses and families. We stand here to allow people to peacefully live in their homes. But Ukraine's army is under growing pressure around Bakhmut as the Russians pour more armor into this area. The promised western tanks probably won't arrive fast enough to make a difference in this battle, but these soldiers hope they will turn the tide of the war. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these is the largest continuous sand desert in the world?  Gobi, Empty Quarter, Namib or Great Victoria? At about 250,000 square miles, the Empty Quarter desert covers parts of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. Up next, we're headed to that desert in the Middle East to talk about dust storms. Our journey begins all the way in the United Arab Emirates. We'll meet Diana Francis, an atmospheric scientist in Abu Dhabi and an expert on dust storms.  Now, when dust storms hit, they can be dangerous, driving thousands of people to hospitals shutting down businesses and schools these storms know no borders and wreak havoc across the Middle East, and the phenomenon cost the region's economies an estimated $13 billion a year. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORETER:  Diana Francis is an atmospheric scientist at Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, and an expert on a natural phenomenon: dust storms. DR. DIANA FRANCIS, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, KHALIFA UNIVERSITY:  Dust storms are weather phenomena that are caused by high wind speed that are occurring near the surface over desert regions. They will lift small particles of sand and this particle will be able to travel thousands of kilometers around the globe. REPORTER:  In June 2020, a colossal dust storm nicknamed Godzilla crossed the Atlantic from the Sahara Desert. Darkening skies across the Caribbean, it was the biggest dust storm worldwide in 20 years, according to NASA, and one of a number recently wreaking havoc across the globe. In 2022, thousands of people were hospitalized across the Middle East, with respiratory problems due to a wave of deadly dust storms. FRANCIS:  In some cases, we have visibility that drops to meters and then people will feel the difficulty to breathe and we can do for example outside activities, whenever the dust storm occur.  REPORTER:  In 2016, the U.N. estimated this extreme weather cost the Middle East and North Africa region's economy billion dollars a year in damage to the environment, agriculture, transport and infrastructure. It's a problem made worse by increasing heat waves and droughts due to climate change and alterations in land use which create more sources of dust. FRANCIS:  I really wanted to know what's special about the Empty Quarter desert, what's happening in the atmosphere on the sand and the land.  REPORTER:  The Empty Quarter desert, 250,000 square miles, stretching across the Arabian Peninsula, it's the world's largest sand desert. Francis and Khalifa University are conducting what she says is first of its kind research in the region, to measure dust storms coming from the empty quarter.  FRANCIS:  So we have a meteorological tower on which we have several sensors at different levels, so it allows us to have the vertical structure of the atmosphere.  REPORETER:  That data helps predict dust storms in the region and further afield. Her work on dust is even more important in a region where solar power is emerging as a green energy source.  FRANCIS:  We know that solar energy efficiency is impacted by dust storm and if we want to understand how much we can rely on these energy sources we need to be able to predict dust storms, and their activity.  The story about studying the weather is a new end story because there is always something new, something novel to discover. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's 10 out of 10, we've definitely heard of a neighborhood cat getting caught in the tree. Well, now, we have a dog -- meet Izzy, who is probably feeling dizzy when he realized he was high up in a tree. Oh what a tizzy. He was lost in his own little world, just trying to have some fun as he was chasing after squirrels but then he got stuck. But Izzy was in luck, first responders came to save him with their little fire truck, and they even brought Izzy some snacks. Shout out time now. High five and a high 10 to Morgan City High School in Morgan City, Louisiana. Go Tigers. Hope you have a happy day. And remember happiness isn't some ideal we have to chase or create. Happiness is right here, right now, whenever we choose to embrace it. Much love, many blessings.  I'm Coy, and this is CNN 10. END230201

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. It's your boy Coy, wishing you a wonderful Wednesday. We're halfway through the week so let's lock in and keep aiming to be a little better today than we were yesterday. Time now for the best 10 minutes in news, and we start today with what is being called a triple threat of winter weather in the United States. More than 40 million people from New Mexico to West Virginia are under various forms of winter weather alerts. Roads in many of these places were considered very dangerous. And one person has already lost their life in a 10-car pileup in Austin, Texas.  Since Monday, EMS crews in the Dallas-Fort Worth area have responded to at least 142 traffic accidents while the forecast shows there will be periods of reprieve over the next two days. Roads will likely be dangerously slick throughout the storm as temperatures remain low.  Millions of people across the southern and central parts of the nation are bracing for an ice storm which could pose a triple threat: ice, sleet and snow. Officials have already closed schools and roads in anticipation of the conditions. In fact, driving in certain areas is already so dangerous in large part because many cities and towns, they're just not equipped to handle this kind of weather. So please tell your family and friends to be careful. Now, let's talk about a different type of storm, hurricanes. Today, we're highlighting a community that's built to withstand them. Babcock Ranch in coastal Florida calls itself America's first solar-powered town and it never lost any power during the devastating hurricane Ian which wreaked havoc on communities all around it.  The town which is located 12 miles inland from Fort Myers has streets that are specifically designed to funnel flood waters away from houses. And landscaping -- well, that's designed to guard against storm surge many of us have either been directly impacted or know somebody who's seen their home or business destroyed by hurricanes, but could the way we design cities be the answer? CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir traveled to Babcock Ranch which is designed to weather the weather. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  When Hurricane Ian brought gusts over 150 miles an hour, much of the power grid in its path did not stand a chance.  Look at that.  And thanks to two feet of rain, even communities miles from the storm surge could not escape life-altering floods.  But even as white caps ripped across the lake in Anthony Grande's (ph) backyard, he was chilled out in front of the TV.  ANTHONY GRANDE, BABCOCK RANCH RESIDENT:  You know, that's one of the things I said to my wife when we were -- were sitting there watching TV, I'm like, I don't have any fear right now.  WEIR:  Anthony and the 2,000 families around him never lose power and did not flood because they live in Babcock Ranch, a community about 15 miles from Ft. Myers, which is 100 percent solar powered.  GRANDE:  I even held on to my generator not knowing what was really going to happen. So my wife was like, get rid of it. I'm like, no, I'm not getting rid of it. I'm not doing it. That's what we -- we go through the test. And this was the test. WEIR:  This was the test. GRANDE:  This was a big test. So. WEIR:  And now you can let go of the generator?  GRANDE:  I did. I gave it to a friend.  WEIR:  Jennifer Langwell (ph) was nervous during the storm because with a Ph.D. in civil engineering, she helped design this place.  JENNIFER LANGWELL, BABCOCK RANCH RESIDENT:  I literally got my construction drawing out and I looked at the wind load that my house was designed to, and I looked at my finished floor elevation, and I looked at the road elevation, and I just mentally was crunching numbers because I was like, this is going to be bad.  WEIR:  And it was. But their interconnected lakes and protected wetlands saved them from flooding. And the 700,000 solar panels in their 150 mega-  watt array all held solid.  I always assumed that solar panels and hurricanes don't mix, that it would turn them into projectiles, but you didn't lose any or -- LANGWELL:  No. That's the beautiful thing about engineering, right, is that you understand the wind loads and you understand the stress and the strain and you design to that.  WEIR:  This place is the brain child of Syd Kitson, an NFL offensive lineman turned developer, who bought a massive cattle ranch, sold most of it to Florida as a nature preserve, and set out to build the cleanest, most resilient town in America.  GRANDE:  Here's the elementary school. We have a field house over there which is now housing people as a shelter.  WEIR:  Right. I guess it's fitting that the mascot of Babcock High are the Trail Blazers.  GRANDE:  Trail Blazers. Everything's very well thought out here.  WEIR:  I've got to say, my heart still breaks. I feel a little guilty leaving the damage -- GRANDE:  Right. WEIR:  But it's a relief to come to a place unscathed like this.  GRANDE:  Yes, we're feeling the guilt to being out here. WEIR:  Are you? GRANDE:  Yes, absolutely. Yes. I mean we've certainly got it really good out here. LANGWELL:  It's unfortunate to feel guilty about it. I feel relieved that we're not adding to what first responders have to deal with and that we're able to help the community. So, we have people here making meals. We're taking in laundry from sheriffs and firefighters that are in from out of town. Because we were resilient, because we were durable, we're able to help in that way.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these sports invented in 1965 is the official state sport of Washington? Tennis, squash, pickleball or badminton? Pickleball was created on Bainbridge Island, Washington, by Joel Pritchard and some friends as a backyard game for kids. Today's story getting a 10 out of 10. Aunt Nora, a passionate prize-winning pickleball playing prodigy giving us some tips on how to dominate in the fastest growing sport in America via her niece, CNN senior producer Janelle Davis. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JANELLE DAVIS, CNN SENIOR PRODUCER (voice-over):  Pickleball is the fastest growing U.S. sport with about 5 million players. This addicting game is a mashup of tennis, ping pong and badminton. I even got hooked and I'm lucky to take my game to the next level. Lucky for me, I have a national competitor in my family. That's Aunt Nora in the white skirt. We go way back. Clearly, she's going easy on me here but at just under five feet, she dominates on the court and has won countless trophies. NORA DAVIS, NATIONAL PICKLEBALL COMPETITOR:  I will play five days a week, anywhere from two to five hours a day. I am truly an addict. J. DAVIS:  She lives in Washington state, the birthplace of pickleball and here are her three tips to take your game to the next level. Number one: add spin to your dink. Okay let's back up for the newbies watching. This part of the court is the non-volley zone, known as the kitchen. Experienced players keep the ball low and get in an offensive position near the kitchen, giving your opponent less time to react. Shots for this is called the dink, a short soft hit into your opponent's kitchen. Here's how it's done -- N. DAVIS:  You're going to get low and then you're going to come up and lift it like you would. But instead of stopping right there, you're going to roll your hand forward. J. DAVIS:  That spin makes your shots lethal. To practice, play a game starting near the kitchen hitting dinks back and forth, keep it low and slow. You'll learn accuracy and patience. N. DAVIS:  You need to have a lot of patience with your dink shots. Your opponent will make a mistake before you do if you have patience. J. DAVIS:  Number two, master the drop shot, one of the hardest shots. The drop is a soft hit from deep in the court that drops into your opponent's kitchen, allowing you to explode towards the net and go on the attack. N. DAVIS:  To do the drop shot, you want to get low and lift just to your chest.  J. DAVIS:  You'll need a loose grip, control swing and to get low, being short like my eye helps too. Number three, time your split step. That's the ready position. You don't want to be moving as you hit the ball. You want to be stabilized. The best players can predict where the ball is going and quickly position themselves for the return.  Now, you're ready to play. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. Today, it's officially Black History Month and February 1st is National Freedom Day, honoring the signing of the 13th Amendment by President Abraham Lincoln which abolished slavery in the U.S.  Today is also hashtag your word Wednesday.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. It's Thursday. So happy Friday eve. I'm Coy Wire. And we're going to start this day with a shout-out to all the teachers out there, keep uplifting, guiding and inspiring. You're so money, baby. Students, dap up your teacher today, give them a handshake or high five and let them know you appreciate them. Speaking of money, let's start today by talking about the debt ceiling in the United States. In case you're still unsure about exactly what the debt ceiling is, we've got you covered. You can also call it the government's debt limit. It's the total amount of money the United States government is authorized to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations, like paying for military salaries, tax refunds, Social Security and Medicare benefits, and interest on the national debt among other things. But once the debt limit is reached and if the government can't borrow any more money, that means the government could fail to make payments, fail to take care of its own obligations by defaulting on all national debt, and that would greatly impact the U.S. government's reputation across the globe. We'll hear more now from White House correspondent Arlette Saenz on what the United States government could be facing in the near future and what the impact could be. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are heading towards a high-stakes showdown over the debt ceilings. This will be the first time Biden McCarthy are meeting in person since McCarthy became House Speaker and both sides have said the debt limit will be on the table. Now both men have said that they don't want to see the nation default on their debts but for the time being they disagree on how to get there. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has insisted that he believes there should be negotiations and that ultimately, they believe that there need to be spending cuts if the debt ceiling will be raised. But President Biden and the White House have insisted that there will be no negotiations over this, and that Congress must fulfill their obligation to raise the debt ceiling. A spokesperson for the White House saying in a statement, quote, the president will ask Speaker McCarthy if he intends to meet his constitutional obligation to prevent a national default, as every other House and Senate leader in U.S. history has done, and as leaders McConnell Schumer and Jeffries have pledged to do. The president, they add, will underscore that the economic security of all Americans cannot be held hostage to force unpopular cuts on working families. Now, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that they are using extraordinary measures until this moment and that the nation's debt limit must be raised by early June. So, certainly this could have huge ripple effects for the U.S. economy if the nation were to default on their debt. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Okay, imagine trying to find a tiny capsule just eight millimeters long and trying to find it on an enormous highway in Australia. Now, imagine the pressure when this tiny capsule is filled with a highly radioactive material. A capsule containing cesium-137 which can cause serious harm went missing as it traveled hundreds and hundreds of miles from a mining site to Perth, the capital of Western Australia. Authorities said this would have been like trying to find a needle in a haystack. So, was this search worthless? Was this mission just an exercise in floccinaucinihilipilification? Or did they find this elusive capsule after all? Here's CNN international correspondent Marc Stewart with the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The radioactive capsule has been found and to give you some context, this is a Hong Kong coin similar in size to a U.S. dime. It's that small. It is used in mining. Here is the history: the capsule was discovered six days after authorities realized it went missing, likely after falling off a truck. Eventually it was found off the side of a road by crews using radiation detection equipment. It was found not far from the Rio Tinto mine, suggesting it fell off the truck soon after it left on January 12th. But the potential search area was enormous a distance longer than the California coastline. A perimeter was set up and now the goal is to transport it in a lead container to a health department facility in Perth. This was concerning because human exposure could cause skin burns, radiation sickness. There's even a cancer risk in some cases. Authorities felt the chance of finding it was slim now they must determine how this happened in the first place. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which airplane model was the first airplane to be considered a jumbo jet? 747, DC-10, 737, or A380? With its first flight on February 9th, 1969, the 747 is your answer here. It was called jumbo jet as it was the first wide body airliner. And up next, we will salute the queen of the skies, the Boeing 747. This spacious and sleek aircraft that was once touted as the future of airplane travel when it took off in 1969 is now a plane of the past, as airlines are opting for more fuel-efficient alternatives. This week, Boeing completed and delivered the last 747 to ever be built. And on Wednesday, the plane flew a path spelling out on the flight tracker to commemorate the moment. Let's learn more about the history of this jumbo jet and what's in store for the airlines of the future. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  When it was revealed in 1969, it broke the mold and defined jumbo. It brought jet travel to the people, carried world leaders, cultural icons, and even spacecraft. For half a century, it was the queen of the skies. But now, the last model has been delivered, Boeing 747 is beginning to approach its final touchdown. Built to meet the boom in demand for air travel in the 1960s, the 747 was a giant that needed the world's largest factory to match its jumbo proportions, 225 feet from nose to tail it had a wing surface bigger than a basketball court, and its innovative wide body double aisle and double deck design would allow it to carry up to 500 passengers, while ensuring it would also be a freight hauling behemoth with looks like no other. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Pan-am will bring you the plane with all the room in the world, before you know it. REPORTER:  Taking to the skies for its first commercial flight in 1970, the 747 cut airfares in half and opened up a world of affordable air travel. Airlines across the globe clamored to have a jumbo jet in their fleet, and airports and their equipment had to be modified to accommodate its enormous size and passenger capacity. But spacious interiors, a trademark spiral staircase and superior service also had the world's rich and famous flocking. Glamorous silver screen appearances cemented its lavish reputation, and it became the go-to transport for many of the world's elite, a trend set to continue with the presidentially modified Air Force One. The 747 was so capable, it was even used to transport NASA's space shuttles and it continues to be used to launch satellites with Virgin Orbit. But the queen of the sky's days of carrying passengers are entering their final chapter. Sales of the redesigned 747-8 failed to take off, with airlines opting for more fuel-efficient two-engine alternatives. Pandemic travel lockdowns grounded much of the remaining fleet and the last made like most still in service will be used to fly cargo. And so, after half a century of service, the sun is beginning to set on Boeing 747. It'll be remembered as one of the most important airplanes ever made. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And today's story getting a 10 out of 10, a Rorschach test from Mars. What do you see when you look at this photo of a rock formation on Mars? A Rorschach test is a psychological test where a person looks at ink blots and then reveals what they see and psychologists analyze the answers to examine a person's personality characteristics, it's all in the eyes of the bear holder. What this actually is that we're seeing is a circular fracture on the surface of Mars, with craters. This high-resolution photo was captured by a reconnaissance orbiter, a spacecraft designed to search for the existence of water on Mars as part of NASA's Mars exploration program. All right. So many great your word Wednesday submissions yesterday. Thanks to Ms. Spicer's civics class at Hughes. Today's word is floccinaucinihilipilification. And this is a noun, one of the longest words in the English language, not easy to pronounce, it means the estimation of something as valueless. Well done, everyone.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. You made it to Friday, and you already know Friday's rock. This is the first Friday in February, one of the coldest months in the year for many Americans but it's also a month that celebrates love and appreciation. So, we're sending you our love and appreciation. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. Let's finish this week strong. We're going to begin today's episode by talking finance, specifically about interest rate hikes. An interest rate is what banks get paid by the people who borrow money from them. In the United States, the Federal Reserve System is the central banking system for the entire country. It was created on December 23rd, 1913 with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act as a way to protect against future financial crises. When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, it means people have to pay back a higher percentage of the money they borrow. Why would the Fed want to do that? Well, because of inflation. The thinking goes that if interest rates are higher and it's more expensive for people and businesses to borrow money, they'll spend less of it and inflation will settle back down. The cost of living in America has gone up significantly as prices of things we buy have risen. We'll hear now from CNN business reporter Matt Egan. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER:  The Fed's war on inflation isn't over but it is shifting. This 25-basis point rate increased from the Fed is the smallest since this fight against inflation began back in March. Now, the Fed is still trying to slow this economy down to knock inflation down. But it's gone from slamming the brakes on the economy to tapping the brakes and that is an important shift because it lowers the risk that the Fed ends up causing an accident, either in financial markets or in the real economy or in both. And the Fed is changing its tune on inflation a bit. The statement says that inflation remains elevated, but it also concedes that it has eased. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Okay. Did you know tsunamis can travel thousands of miles at speeds up to 500 miles per hour. A tsunami is a series of waves usually caused by an underwater event like an earthquake or a volcanic eruption and they can cause serious damage to communities that are hit by them. More than 700 million people live in coastal areas that could be exposed to tsunamis. So, imagine how powerful it would be if we could predict them. We're traveling to Tonga, a Polynesian country that's part of an archipelago of islands to hear about the work of the folks at the Tonga Geological Society who are studying the ocean floor to get a better sense of what causes tsunamis. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  Late December, in the middle of the South Pacific, an underwater volcano is active once again. Two weeks later, a series of eruptions will reverberate around the planet and be visible from space. Tsunami warnings were issued across the Pacific and the next afternoon, a series of waves hit the island country of Tonga, some as high as 15 meters, killing three people and leaving mass destruction in their wake. When the dust had settled a few months later, a ship from New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research or NIWAR set sail to find out what had triggered the eruption. Marine geology technician Erica Spain was on board. DR. ERICA SPAIN, MARINE GEOLOGY TECHNICIAN, NIWA:  The voyage up to Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai, an active volcano, was really exciting. It's a multi-  disciplinary voyage. So, you've got multiple science streams working together to try and figure out what was going on and why it erupted so violently. There are the multi-beams on either side. REPORTER:  Spain's mission was to map the sea floor around the volcano using a machine called a multi-beam echo sounder. SPAIN:  An acoustic pulse, so a ping or a sound is emitted or sent out from the bottom of the ship and then it echoes effectively off the sea floor and then we have hydrophones or a listening ear that receives that echo and from that we can determine how deep the sea floor is and build up an idea of its shape and geometry. Every volcano has a different trigger in terms of when it might erupt, and by mapping Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai and then comparing that to other volcanoes, we can begin to build up a better image of what these triggers might be or what they might look like on the sea floor. REPORTER:  Mapping, taking rock samples and filming underwater all help build a bigger picture of what happened here. SPAIN:  So, you have to become a seafloor detective to piece all those small parts together. REPORTER:  That detective work can help countries like Tonga better prepare for tsunamis. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: The vernal equinox marks the start of what season? Spring, summer, fall or winter? Happening on March 20th this year, the vernal equinox marks the start of spring. Bye, bye wintertime. Yesterday, February 2nd was Groundhog Day. On this day, some people predict when winter will come to an end by watching a groundhog. In Pennsylvania, my home state, one of the most notorious groundhogs of all time, Punxsutawney Phil. Each year in a tradition derived from a Pennsylvania Dutch superstition, people watch to see how the groundhog emerges from its burrow and whether or not the furry creature sees its shadow well that will determine when winter will end and spring begins. February 2nd isn't just some random day. It falls at the midpoint between the winter solstice and the spring or vernal equinox, making it the ideal time to consider when springtime might finally come. We're going to meet up with one of our in-house experts now to break it all down and find out what Punxsutawney Phil had in store for us this time. All right. The forecast in the hat you've all been waiting for, we're here with friend of the show, CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. And here it is, Punxsutawney Phil officially predicts six more weeks of winter after seeing a shadow Thursday morning. ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  That's right. Now, the legend goes, if the groundhog sees his shadow, which he did this morning, we will have six more weeks of winter. But if there had not been a shadow, spring would actually arrive early. Now scientifically speaking, winter will officially come to an end on the equinox, on March 20th, regardless of what Phil predicts but Mother Nature doesn't always follow the timetable and neither does Phil. WIRE:  All right. So, what if we don't like his forecast? CHINCHAR:  Okay. So don't worry because he's actually usually wrong. In the past, Phil has been way more likely to see his shadow than not in fact. He's reportedly seen his shadow 105 times, but not seen his shadow only 20 times. Statistically speaking, Phil has only been correct in his forecast about 40 percent of the time in just the last years. WIRE:  That's not very good, Phil. Sorry. The interesting thing here is also the Phil's not the only forecasting groundhog. In fact, there are many others just like him. He has competitors in states like Georgia, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio and some states they're not even groundhogs, they have nutrias, they have possums, they have ducks and a lobster? CHINCHAR:  I'm not sure how you'd see that shadow, not so much. Now some of the more colorful names include PRC shadow of Louisiana, General Beauregard Lee of Georgia, and Staten Island Chuck from New York just to name a few. And ultimately quite what this means is if you don't like Phil's forecast, chances are you'll like one of the other forecasters' forecasts just as well. (MUSIC) WIRE:  And for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, scientists have invented a shape-shifting robot. Check this out. The robot was presented as part of the research on metal micro particles, and it's made from gallium, a metal with a low melting point. The robot is able to move via the use of magnets. Scientists hope that one of the areas this type of drippy droid could help would be surgeries believe it or not, potentially making them more effective and safe. And their inspiration for all this? A sea cucumber. What in the world? All right. Special shout out now to Sycamore Middle School in Sycamore, Illinois. We see you. It has been awesome learning with you this week. Let's finish this day off right and take boundless energy into the weekend. And remember, you are more powerful than you know. I'm Coy Wire, and it's been a blessing to spend this week with you.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, lovely people. Hope you had a wonderful weekend. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, and we're grateful to be here to help you make this an awesome week. First up today, the latest on the dramatic takedown of a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had been flying across the United States over the past few days. The U.S. government ordering an F-22 fighter jet to use a heat- seeking missile to blast the balloon out of the sky, and that's exactly what happened on Saturday. Some witnesses were caught off guard by the delayed sound of the explosion. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That plane just -- had a strike.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't see the balloon anymore. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I just got it on video. I did, all right? The balloon is gone. (EXPLOSION) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Whoa! Did you hear that? Are you still video? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I am still videoing. The sound just hit us. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Okay. So how did we get here? Well, last week, the U.S. government confirmed it had been tracking the 90-foot balloon which was first spotted over Montana on Wednesday. The suspected spy balloon from China even flew over a number of sensitive U.S. military sites over the course of a few days.  China's defense ministry spokesperson though has protested the shoot down saying the balloon was a civilian weather aircraft which flew off course by accident, but U.S. officials maintained that the balloon was being used for surveillance purposes.  There was much debate about what the U.S. should have done about the balloon, including calls to shoot it down immediately with critics of President Biden saying the decision to allow the balloon to fly over the country for days was, quote, weak. But top U.S. military officials have said that the balloon posed no military risk and that they were taking steps to protect against any collection of sensitive information, and they wanted to wait until the balloon was over water to protect civilians from any potential falling debris after a shoot down. So, on Saturday, the U.S. military did shoot that balloon down off the coast of South Carolina. Afterwards, China saying that the U.S. government overreacted and seriously violated international practice. The U.S. secretary of state had canceled a trip to China after the appearance of the balloon on Thursday, so this event is causing even more tension between the two nations. A second balloon carrying similar surveillance equipment has been seen flying over Central and South America and a senior U.S. defense official said Saturday that China flew surveillance balloons over the United States in three instances during the Trump administration but never for this long. All of this is raising questions about these aircraft and the threat they might pose. Here's CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  President Biden told his top military leaders in a meeting on Wednesday to shoot down that Chinese spy balloon transiting over the U.S. as soon as possible. The president heard advice from military leaders who warned that shooting anything down over land, over ground could pose a risk to American lives so ultimately the president heeded their advice and waited to have this balloon shot down until it was over the waters on Saturday afternoon. President Biden was briefed on those final plans, Friday evening. And ultimately, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin gave that final go-ahead shortly after noon on Saturday. Now, the president was flying on Air Force One from Syracuse, New York, to Maryland, and was on the phone with his top officials as this operation was underway. And here's what he had to tell reporters about the considerations given to that decision. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  On Wednesday, when I was briefed on the balloon, I ordered the Pentagon to shoot it down on Wednesday as soon as possible. They decided -- without doing damage to anyone on the ground, they decided that the best time to do that was they got over water outside -- within our -- within the 12-mile limit. They successfully took it down and I want to compliment our aviators who did it and we'll have more to report on this a little later. Thank you. REPORTER:  Mr. President, what do you say about China? What's your message to China? REPORTER:  You were saying the recommendation from your -- was from your national security -- BIDEN:  I told them to shoot it down. REPORTER:  Oh Wednesday? BIDEN:  On Wednesday. REPORTER:  But the recommendation -- BIDEN:  They said to me, let's wait until the safest place to do it. SAENZ:  Republicans were quick to criticize President Biden for not taking steps to down this balloon sooner. Republicans have argued that this is a sign of weakness in the White House's approach towards China.  But the White House has pushed back, saying that this was a responsible action for a commander-in-chief to take. They are arguing that what the president was trying to do was prioritize saving American lives. Now, there are lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who are calling for briefings and hearings into this matter and the so-called Gang of Eight congressional leaders will receive a briefing from Biden administration officials next week, as there are still so many outstanding questions about how this incident unfolded. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  This is the portion of this balloon that investigators want to get their hands on, that payload -- a central core and what looked like a couple of solar arrays on either side. When the balloon was destroyed, you could clearly see it falling away below.  Now if this had the mass of a human like a skydiver, it might be falling at 100, 150 miles an hour, something like that. If it had the mass of a couple of cars, its terminal velocity might have been more like 500 miles an hour or up from that. What that means is when it got to this area, just off Myrtle Beach, the water would be essentially like concrete, it would hit it with tremendous force and be absolutely misshapen, torn apart, broken up by this impact. What does that mean to recovery? What it means is the first thing they have to do when they get settled out there is get divers down 47 feet down. That's good. That's a good workable depth.  There, they have to look at this, figure out how many pieces it's in, where they are, assess it, figure out if some of it is buried down in the muck below, and then come up with a list of priorities. What do they want to bring up first? How do they want to bring it up to protect all of this as much as they can and how long it's going to take? These operations typically are longer than most people expect even though they believe this one could be pretty fast. Think of it this way, this is like an underwater crime scene now, and they have to protect their evidence as best they can if they want to learn all they can about this balloon. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these locations holds the current record for the highest officially registered temperature? Kuwait, Iran, California, or Texas? California's Death Valley hit 134 degrees Fahrenheit in 1913, at a location appropriately named Furnace Creek Ranch. Right now, it is far from blazing in the United States, especially in the Northeast where there have been record low temperatures this past weekend. Take a look at these numbers, a cold front brought dangerous wind chill temperatures throughout New York, the New England states, and up into Canada. This cold front comes a week after an ice storm in Texas canceled flights and left hundreds of thousands of homes without power. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Record low at temperatures across the region, but here in New York City, right outside of Central Park, people have been doing what they do best here in New York. They have been braving the elements all day. I've been speaking with tourists and New Yorkers who are unfazed by the cold temperatures.  All day, I've been watching my friend here Gamal (ph) who is running this hot dog cart here. He had a hard time this morning trying to get it set up because his generator had actually frozen, the oil in the gas that was inside of it. He had a hard time getting it set up.  And he's told me that business is a little bit slow today, right? Not so good not many people out here in these cold temperatures, and just take a look -- this bottle of water -- frozen solid. It has been frozen all day. That should give you an idea of just how cold it is here.  But as I said, New Yorkers, those who are visiting for the most part taking it in stride. If you are going to go outside in these very cold temperatures, to dress appropriately, wear your layers and if you don't need to, it's probably best to stay home. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, let's go to Mount Washington, New Hampshire, where it was colder than a polar bear's toenail. Coldest wind chill ever recorded in the United States, negative 108 degrees Fahrenheit. This happened over the weekend, wind gusts reaching 98 miles per hour. That would be like a category 2 hurricane.  Experts say it would take less than 60 seconds to get frostbite in those temperatures. One meteorologist there said that his wrist was exposed between his coat and gloves and it felt like being continuously stung by a bee. That is unbeelievably cold.  All right. You already snow what time it is. Shout out to Bucks County Technical High School in Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania -- rise up. We only get 86,400 seconds in a day, and when they're gone, they're gone forever. So live with a sense of urgency today. Don't take any moment for granted.  I'm Coy Wire, headed to Phoenix.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, lovely people? Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN, coming to you from Phoenix, Arizona, this week - - home to cacti, beautiful skies, Super Bowl LVII this Sunday and much, much more. Now behind me is Piestewa Peak, one of the highest points of the Phoenix Mountains, named in honor of Lori Ann Piestewa, a United States Army soldier who became the first known Native American woman to die in combat while serving our nation. We're going to start with the latest news out of Turkey, a country that sits partly in Asia and partly in Europe. A powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake occurred Monday in Turkey and parts of Syria, which collapsed thousands of buildings, killing more than 3,000 people. It created a new humanitarian disaster in a region already strained by war, a refugee crisis and deep economic troubles. Turkey hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, the most in the world. And governments from around the world have been quick to respond to Turkey's request for international assistance. Videos shared from Turkey and across the border in Syria showed the extent of the damage. We'll keep you updated as the situation continues to unfold. Here's CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis helping us understand why earthquakes occur so frequently in Turkey and why this one was so consequential. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAREN MAGINNIS, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Now this is real time. These are some of the aftershocks. And this is an interesting trajectory, just kind of this geometry of where that energy was lying as it just kind of raced along that fault line. And this is one of the most active seismic areas in the entire world. That's because we've got a lot of tectonic plates moving around across this region, we've got a lot of rift zones, and this is illustrative of just how devastating these earthquakes can be. Now most of these earthquakes are not major earthquakes. But this one 7.8. It rivals one that occurred in northeastern Turkey in 1939. There were 16,000, 17,000 fatalities associated with that. It was at the same magnitude. This earthquake was shallow that means the effects are going to be felt much more severely than if it were much further down into the core of the earth. All right. Here are these tectonic plates I was talking about essentially these are constantly shifting. There are always earthquakes somewhere in this region being reported, but this one happened to be a major earthquake and devastating. This is devastating, one that will be in the record books. We'll remember February 2023 for this massive violent earthquake that took place in south central Turkey that has interrupted so many people's lives, but not just in Turkey, in Israel, in Jordan, in Syria where so many displaced people are currently located. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  January's U.S. jobs report surprised a lot of economists. The results showed far more jobs added than expected and the unemployment rate fell to 3.4 percent, the lowest since May of 1969. With America adding more than half a million jobs last month, we're getting more surprising clues about the overall state of the U.S. economy, and it comes as the country grapples with the impact and usefulness of new artificial intelligence platforms. Some worry that one day sooner than later a plethora of jobs could be taken away, from real humans and given to robots and computers that could presumably do the work faster, cheaper, et cetera. CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich sat down with an expert to discuss whether this threat is real or imagined. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS & POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Which jobs is AI coming after first? SHELLY PALMER, PROFESSOR OF ADVANCED MEDIA:  If you're a middle manager, you're doomed. Any kind of commodity sales person, report writers and journalists, accountants and bookkeepers and oddly enough doctors who are looking -- who specialize in things like drug interactions. YURKEVICH:  Do you mean out of a job -- PALMER:  No. YURKEVICH:  -- or you mean that part of your job? PALMER:  That one. YURKEVICH:  OK. That's the relief a lot of Americans are looking for right now. Will it take my job? PALMER:  Yes and no. It's not going to replace you. Someone who knows how to use it well is going to take your job and that's a guarantee. YURKEVICH:  By 2025, the World Economic Forum predicts that 85 million jobs will be displaced by automation and technology, but it will also create 97 million new roles. We've seen it before in the auto industry. PALMER:  While the auto worker may be displaced because they are not as good at welding or as painting as the robot, there's probably 35 people that have to be involved in the creation and maintenance of that device that welds better than a person. YURKEVICH:  And that's what happened at Carbon Robotics, former auto workers now building an AI laser weeder in Detroit for farms. The laser weeder still operated by a human but run by AI can do the work of between 40 to 50 people says the CEO, filling roles that are hard to find humans for. This music is composed solely by artificial intelligence called AIVA. It even has an album you can stream. AI music is more affordable. There's no producer, composer or artist to pay. KARL FOWLKES, ENTERTAINMENT AND BUSINESS ATTORNEY:  It's taken away opportunity from songwriters, producers and artists, right? So the people are trying to feed them for their families. YURKEVICH:  Something similar is happening in the art world. Leading artist Kara Ortiz and two others to file a class-action lawsuit against three AI art companies for copyright infringement. Ortiz claims they're using her name and art to train the AI. KARA ORTIZ, ARTIST:  It's feast and famine for most of us we go job by job, and what happens when there's a little bit less work to go around? ROBOT:  My father tried to teach me human emotions. PALMER:  There's a wonderful scene in the movie "I, Robot". Detective Spooner hates robots, he says. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can a robot write a symphony? Can a robot turn a canvas into a beautiful masterpiece? PALMER:  And the robot looks up and goes, can you? Every one of us is not Mozart or Rembrandt or Picasso or choose your super famous amazing artist or artisan. We're just people. This is not coming to kill us. It's coming to help us. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Located in midtown Manhattan, which of these sports facilities has dubbed the "World's Most Famous Arena"? Churchill Downs, Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden or Silverstone Circuit? The correct answer here is Madison Square Garden, often referred to as The Garden. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And up next, most of us have heard of facial recognition technology. The software capable of matching a human face from a digital image or video against real faces in real time, or a database of faces. While the technology is being praised as a way to heighten security and can make things like unlocking your phone quicker and easier, some view it as an invasion of privacy. What do you think? Here's CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez from inside New York City's Madison Square Garden. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You've come up on (INAUDIBLE) matching somebody on our facial recognition list. OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  He was recognized on facial recognition cameras, then confronted. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you Benjamin Noren? BENJAMIN NOREN, LAWYER:  Yes. JIMENEZ:  This is how lawyer Benjamin Noren, from one New York City law firm, was greeted by Madison Square Garden staff while trying to attend an event in the fall. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The ticket has been revoked and you are not permitted in the building. JIMENEZ:  It's because Noren works for a law firm representing ticket brokers in a lawsuit against Madison Square Garden Entertainment. All of the roughly 60 lawyers at his firm are also banned until the litigation is resolved. Some experts believe it's a slippery slope, and not just the discretionary power of who else could be flagged in the future, but one method being used to enforce it, even if it is legal. DAVE MAASS, DIRECTOR OF INVESTIGATIONS, ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION:  I have read their privacy policy. They explicitly say that the biometrics they capture from you can be used for any purpose that would -- that would benefit their economic interest. JIMENEZ:  Some don't believe it should be used at all. ALBERT FOX CAHN, FOUNDER, SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY OVERSIGHT PROJECT:  And I am terrified of the day where we allow companies to use so many forms of tracking and surveillance that, you know, we end up in the middle of one of the largest cities on the planet without any place we can actually go, while keeping our privacy. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And today's story getting a 10 out of 10, we're talking about the world's oldest dog again. Two weeks ago, we brought you Spike, a 23-year-  old Chihuahua mix from Ohio who was named the oldest living dog. But along comes Bobi and Bobi's like not so fast my man's best friend. Bobi is a Portuguese mastiff from Portugal and at 30 years old, he has now been named the world's oldest living dog by the Guinness World Records. Having lived twice his life expectancy, he's also now considered officially the oldest dog to ever live. The previous record of 29 years in five months was set back in the 1930s by an Australian cattle dog named Bluey. Bobi's age has been confirmed by the veterinary medical service and a Portuguese pet database. Thirty years ago, that was 1993 when the World Wide Web was made available to the public for the first time. So, congrats Bobi, that's a WWW to you. Also winning, Salinas South Middle School in Salina, Kansas -- shout out to you today. Thanks for coming, commenting and subscribing on our CNN 10 YouTube channel. Have a fan cactus day, y'all.

(END VIDEOTAPE) COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Just like presidents before him, many of those themes were discussed last night when U.S. President Joe Biden gave his annual State of the Union Address to Congress. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, reporting from Phoenix, Arizona, for you all week long. The U.S. Constitution does not require a president to give this speech. In fact, Article II Section 3 only says, quote, he shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient. So the fact that this speech happens every year, that it's done in person, that it's televised, and the fact that it's followed up by a response from the opposing political party -- well, those are all traditions associated with the State of the Union, not requirements by the Constitution itself. Still, the event is an opportunity for the U.S. president to tout what he sees as successes by his administration and it's an opportunity for the opposing party to lay out a different vision for the country. This was President Biden's second official State of the Union Address, but it was first given to a divided Congress. After Republicans took control of the House of Representatives following last year's midterm elections. Have a listen to some of the highlights of what the president had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Folks, the story of America is a story of progress and resilience, of always moving forward, of never ever giving up. It's a story unique among all nations. We're the only country that has emerged from every crisis we've ever entered stronger than we got into it. Look, folks, that's what we're doing again. Two years ago, the economy was reeling. I stand here tonight after we've created with the help of many people in this room 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president's created in four years because of you all, because of the American people. (APPLAUSE) Two years ago -- and two years ago, COVID had shut down -- our businesses were closed, our schools were robbed of so much, and today, COVID no longer controls our lives. And two years ago, democracy faced the greatest threat to the civil war and today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken. (APPLAUSE) As we gather here tonight, we're writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders asked me to define America and they do believe it or not, I try to define it in one word, and I mean this -- possibilities. We don't think anything is beyond our capacity, everything is a possibility. You know we're often told that Democrats and Republicans can't work together, but over the past two years, we've proved the cynics and naysayers wrong. Yes, we disagreed plenty and yes, there were times when Democrats went alone. But time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together, came together to defend us stronger and safer Europe. It came together to pass one in the -- one in a generation, once in a generation infrastructure law, building bridges connecting our nation and our people. In fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan pieces of legislation since becoming president, from reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, the Electoral Count Reform Act, the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love. And to my Republican friends, if we could work together the last Congress, there's no reason we can't work together and find consensus on important things in this Congress as well. (APPLAUSE) Well, folks, so let's look at the results. We're not finished yet by any stretch of the imagination, but the unemployment rate is at 3.4 percent, a 50-year low. A near record -- a near record unemployment, near record unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers. We've already created your help eight hundred thousand good paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years. So, I've come to fulfill my constitutional obligation to report in the State of the Union and here's my report, because the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Now, as for the tradition of the opposing political party's response to the state of the union address, it started in the 1960s and it's a speech given by Republicans when there's a Democratic president and by Democrats when there's a Republican president. Last night, the rebuttal came from Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas. Sanders became Arkansas's first female governor after she was elected in November. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS (R), ARKANSAS:  From out-of-control inflation and violent crime, to the dangerous border crisis and threat from China, Biden and the Democrats have failed you. They know it and you know it, and it's time for a change. Tonight, let us reaffirm our commitment to a timeless American idea, that government exists not to rule the people but to serve the people. Democrats want to rule us with more government control, but that's not who we are. America is the greatest country the world has ever known because we're the freest country the world has ever known, with the people who are strong and resilient. President Biden inherited the fastest economic recovery on record, the most secure border in history, cheap, abundant, homegrown energy, fast rising wages, a rebuilt military and a world that was stable and at peace. But over the last two years, Democrats destroyed it all, a new generation of Republican leaders are stepping up not to be caretakers of the status quo but to be change makers for the American people. We know not what the future holds but we know who holds the future in his hands. And with God as our witness, we will show the world that America is still the place where freedom reigns and liberty will never die. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these painters was known for his "drip technique" of splashing paint onto a surface? Salvador Dali, Jackson Pollock, Claude Monet, or Pablo Picasso? Modern American painter Jackson Pollock became famous for us look out I'm about to splatter some paint technique in the mid-1950s. In today's story getting a 10 out of 10, an accidental art installation on a highway in Australia. Take a look at this -- a cargo truck on the highway lost control and spilled more than 260 gallons of paint. That's enough paint for hundreds of canvases and aren't the results just so perfectly and perfect it turned the coastal area into a scene that would certainly catch the attention of Jackson Pollock. Hang this one in the Louvre, people. All right. I want to give a special shout out to Hyatts Middle School in Powell, Ohio, for the work of art you created in the comments section of our CNN 10 YouTube Channel and my @CoyWire social accounts. Thanks for the love and go Eagles. All right. My perfectly imperfect people out there -- remember, of the nearly 8 billion people on this planet, there is no one in the world like you.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone, it's your boy Coy coming to you from Super Bowl radio row here in Phoenix, Arizona, ahead of Sunday's big game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs. We have a great show for you today, but not a lot of time to do it, so let's get to it. Now, we do have to start with some sad news out of Turkey and Syria -- an update on the earthquake we told you about earlier this week. The death toll from the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria continues to rise, with upwards of 11,000 people dead when we recorded our show. Additionally, eight agencies and experts warned that time is running out to help rescue people stuck in the rubble who may still be alive. In addition, tens of thousands of people have been injured. The earthquake with a 7.8 magnitude struck Turkey a neighboring Syria on Monday. The quake is one of the strongest to hit the region in more than 100 years. Additionally, rescuers have faced shortages of trucks fuel and time to deliver aid to impacted areas. Thousands of buildings collapsed and aid agencies are particularly worried about northwestern Syria where more than 4 million people were already relying on humanitarian assistance. To make matters worse, freezing weather conditions are further endangering survivors and complicating rescue efforts as more than 100 aftershocks have struck the region. We'll hear now from CNN correspondent Salma Abdelaziz who is joining us from Istanbul to describe the efforts of survivors and what's happening currently in the region. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  We're at a buzzing aid distribution center here in the center of Istanbul. There are hundreds of volunteers, municipal workers, all here to try and help those in the earthquake zone. You can see them right here. They're packing food. Everything you're looking at here has been donated by individuals, by families, by businesses donations that people want to see go to that affected area. So, they're packing these boxes really with the basics. I want to show you here. We've got diapers, clothes, juice boxes for kids -- I mean, anything you can imagine, mostly, of course, non-medical aid here, just individuals and businesses doing what they can. Of course, Turkey is receiving help from dozens of countries. I think over 70 countries have pledged help to Turkey, but there is a sense that Turks want to help each other, real community spirit here. Volunteers tell us they've been able already to send dozens of trucks, tons of aid and it just keeps coming. An absolutely humongous catastrophe, the scope and scale of it almost incomprehensible, and so, there can never be enough of this help. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these U.S. government agencies forecast weather and monitors ocean conditions? FAA, NASA, NOAA, or DOJ? These duties fall under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration known as NOAA. Now, part of the mission of NOAA is to better understand storms and the potential impact they may have when they make landfall. And one way NOAA pilots collect data is by flying over hurricanes and sometimes directly into them with special equipped aircraft through their Hurricane Hunter Program. Fasten your seat belts y'all, this could get bumpy. Time to learn some more as we go navigate some unfriendly skies above the storm. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LT. CMDR. DANIELLE VARWIG, PILOT/NOAA CORPS:  Flying over a hurricane, it's otherworldly. It gives me a little bit of euphoria. Pilots are taught to not fly near these things and here I am flying at 45,000 feet above it all for the sake of national safety. REPORTER:  Former U.S. Air Force pilot, Lieutenant Commander Danielle Varwig, is a hurricane hunter pilot for NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. VARWIG:  Of course, I get nervous before every flight. REPORTER:  NOAA pilots like Varwig fly over and into storms and hurricanes across the western Atlantic, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico, collecting weather data to help forecast where and when these events will make landfall. VARWIG:  Most of the time, we're in the clouds and now we're trusting our instruments and trusting our flight directors on board with us to navigate around it. REPORTER:  Flight director Nikki Hathaway is often by her side, using radar data to help the pilots navigate through the storm. NIKKI HATHAWAY, NOOA FLIGHT DIRECTOR:  Yeah, it's a bumpy ride. I would say if you are not a fan of roller coasters, it's probably not the job for you. Essentially on this aircraft, it's a flying science lab. The data that we're collecting on board essentially goes back down to the National Hurricane Center and a variety of other researchers and this data is being used real time to make life-saving decisions impacting the people on the ground potentially in harm's way. REPORTER:  That data helps protect millions of people across North and Central America and the Caribbean. HATHAWAY:  You're always thinking about those people in harm's way, and when it is your people, you know, when it's impacting your home, there's that extra element of just like stress in the back of your head, but it's really important to compartmentalize those feelings to get the job done. REPORTER:  Neither Varwig nor Hathaway flew this season, but over the past couple of years, they've been deployed for days, weeks, sometimes months at a time. VARWIG:  It is hard to be away from my kids. The one thing that pushes me through dealing with the separation from my family is the fact that I am serving my country. REPORTER:  That mission to serve to keep others safe come hail or shine is what sets these women apart. VARWIG:  I want to put myself out there if anything to be a role model to little girls, little black girls. I want to make sure that others can look to me and say, okay, well, she's doing it, then I can, too. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. Sports history was made Tuesday night when Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James became the NBA's all-time leading scorer, breaking the record of 38,387 points set more than 38 years ago by another Lakers legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. LeBron entered the league out of high school in 2003 as an 18-year-old from Akron, Ohio. And now at 38, he's still going strong. He's been a driving force for creating change from speaking up on social justice issues to creating the I Promise School in his home state. LeBron is also known for his actions off the court. Our CNN 10 special guest Omar Jimenez is in Los Angeles covering this historic moment. (BEGIN VIDSEOTAPE) OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  People came to see history and they witnessed it. LeBron James now the all-time leading scorer in NBA history, and he would be the first to admit that he didn't think he would be the one to break what some thought was a previously unbreakable record. But when you look at everything LeBron has done over the course of his career, who else would it have been? And the moment came on a Tuesday night. And when that happened, when he hit a fade away off the left elbow, almost nothing but net, he ran to center court, raised his arms in triumph as an entire arena cheered him on, likely many more watching from home. He came to the center court and was greeted by his family as a crowd chanted MVP, he was emotional as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the person whose record he now eclipsed, embraced him and greeted him along with the NBA commissioner. And when you look at LeBron James's legacy, the on the court, of course, will be respected and always remembered. But the reaction and the embraces that he had once he crossed that milestone or emblematic of who he is off the court. And for many, all of those come together in the legacy that is LeBron James. And when you talk about the historic milestone that was crossed, it wasn't just a moment in NBA history. For those watching and that have followed him all around the world, this was a moment in history. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  In today's story getting a 10 out of 10, it's absolutely nuts. Lots of them. A pest control expert in California found more than 700 pounds of acorns from behind a wall in a home in Glen Ellen, California. Now that's a cornucopia. You're probably thinking dang squirrels, why'd you go nuts in that person's wall like that? Turns out, woodpeckers were the culprits. Typically, this type of bird would peck away and drop thousands of acorns through a hole and store them inside dying tree stumps but not these woodpeckers. Look out, because they could be coming to your neighborhood next. All right. Shout out time now. We're going to Oceanside Middle School in Thomaston, Maine. We see you. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. Did you know that today, February 9th is National Pizza Day. Whether it's New York style thin crust, Chicago style deep dish, or anything in between, pizza is an American dream, and you all have a pizza our heart. I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10. END230210

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, lovely people? The weekend is just around the corner. Friday's rock. We are fueled up, ready to share the best 10 minutes in the news with you. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10. Let's finish this week strong. We're going to start today with an update from a story earlier this week, the Chinese spy balloon. The past few days, a new timeline of what happened has come into focus, and it turns out, a day before the suspected Chinese spy balloon entered U.S. airspace over Alaska, the Defense Intelligence Agency sent an internal report that a foreign object was headed towards U.S. territory, but the report was not flagged as urgent in top defense officials weren't immediately alarmed. But when the balloon entered Alaskan airspace and then turned south, officials began to think the balloon might have been sent as part of a spy mission. And when the balloon hovered over areas in the United States that are deemed to places of top security, including sensitive military facilities the real mission of the balloon came into focus. The Biden administration says the timeline of events helps explain why U.S. defense officials didn't act immediately, even before the balloon had crossed over into U.S. territory. But some Republicans have criticized the government for not acting sooner and not seeing the balloon as an urgent threat. They argued that they should have shot the balloon down before it even crossed into the continental U.S. But other officials within the administration have argued that the benefits of gathering additional intelligence on the balloon outweigh shooting it down immediately. We'll keep you posted and updated as the situation unfolds. We'll hear now from Selina Wang, a CNN correspondent based in Beijing, with more analysis. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Beijing is hitting back at Washington's statements about the suspected spy balloon. The Pentagon said on Tuesday that China refused a conversation with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin following the downing of the balloon. Well, now, China's defense ministry is saying they rejected that call because the conditions were not right, given the U.S.'s, quote, irresponsible and seriously wrong approach. We've seen Beijing's rhetoric hardened significantly after the U.S. military shot down the balloon, after initially expressing regret for what they claim is a weather balloon that flew off course. Beijing is now accusing the U.S. of overreacting and violating international practice. The contrast between what Beijing and Washington are claiming is only getting starker. You have China on one hand doubling down on its claim this was a civilian balloon that took an unplanned course that was out of their control. On the other hand, the Pentagon has said it has 100 percent certainty that the downed Chinese balloon was not being used for civilian purposes. CNN has reported that U.S. intelligence officials believe the balloon is part of an extensive military run surveillance program that involves a fleet of balloons spanning five continents. China's ministry of foreign affairs said that claim is, quote, likely part of the U.S.'s information and public opinion warfare and accuse the U.S. of being the world's largest surveillance reconnaissance country. The Pentagon has said that maintaining open lines of communication with China are particularly important in moments like this. The question still remains as to whether this balloon incident will lead to long-term damage to the relationship between the U.S. and China that is already extremely tense. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  A 7.8 magnitude earthquake shook Turkey and Syria in the early hours of Monday morning. It was so powerful that it was felt as far as Cyprus, Lebanon and Israel. But this region is no stranger to earthquakes so why was this one so devastating. This is one of the strongest earthquakes to hit Turkey in about a century and it was followed by dozens of aftershocks, some almost as powerful as the initial quake. And then there's the question of how shallow this earthquake was at the epicenter, just 18 kilometers deep, causing severe shaking on the ground. This is an earthquake more powerful than the one that hit Haiti in 2010, causing utter devastation. And this region is located on a major fault line. In the disaster zone, thousands of homes have collapsed. Now many of Turkey's apartment blocks are built to modern design standards but still about 20 percent of its urban environment is not. And then when you take a look at Northwest Syria, well, that country has been battle scarred. There, many of the structures were extremely susceptible to collapse. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: The Roman numeral LVII represents which of these numbers? 107, 52, 57, or 102? The answer is 57 and Super Bowl LVII kicks off this Sunday, marking the 57th edition of the big game. It's estimated that two-thirds of the U.S. population watched last year's Super Bowl. That's more than 200 million people, and that's why a 30-second commercial during this year's game cost $7 million. So, yeah, all eyes will be on Glendale, Arizona, this Sunday, when the Kansas City Chiefs face off against the Philadelphia Eagles. Some watch the game for the commercials. Others watch for the halftime show, which this year will be headlined by none other than Rihanna. But no matter how you look at it, the Super Bowl is big business. In fact, the Arizona Chamber of Commerce said last Super Bowl they hosted here in 2015 generated about $720 million for the city, but they're expecting close to one billion dollars for this one. And for the first time, the area is expecting more than a million visitors to the city at the same time, with so much action happening in one place, keeping the event fun and safe is a major concern for security experts. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  What are U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter - UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're flying about 500 feet. FLORES:  A U.S. Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All clear. FLORES:  And an F-16 fighter jet doing over Glendale, Arizona? They're tasked with guarding the skies over Super Bowl LVII. With nearly 200,000 fans expected for the big game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles, security is a multiagency effort. From this operations center, the FBI, alongside more than 40 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies will use these 360-degree cameras to have eyes on every inch of the stadium. Sky patrol is in the hands of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Air and Marine Operations. When your teams are patrolling, what could they be looking for? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're going to look for anything out of the ordinary. It could be anything from smoke to disruptions. FLORES:  CBP Air and Marine Operations will be able to fly over the stadium during the big game, but no other aircraft will because the FAA will be imposing a flight restriction that's 30 miles wide. Those flight restrictions will be enforced by NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, with these Air Force F-16 fighter jets. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Since 9/11, we've been able to safely escort out any aircraft that's violated restricted airspace. FLORES:  NORAD is taking no chances. This KC-135 Stratotanker is part of the fleet on hand. This aircraft can carry up to 200,000 pounds of fuel. There are 10 tanks on board including some on the wings. And it can refuel an F-16 midair in minutes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It prevents us from having a return for fuel on the ground. So it's absolutely critical. FLORES:  The fighter jets refuel from a receptacle that's right behind the pilot. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And my job as the pilot is just to remain within the basket in a safe controlled stable position. If the FAA's flight restrictions are broken, NORAD or CBP air and marine operations will engage. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Sunday's game is considered one of the most evenly matched Super Bowls ever and experts are divided on who they think is going to win. But for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, what does the animal kingdom have to say? Apparently, a lot. In Iowa, a baby giraffe at the Blank Park Zoo stuck its neck out and chose the leafy snack that represented a Chiefs win. In Maryland, a bear at the Salisbury zoo disagreed and went for the box with Eagles logo on it. Kansas, this orangutan said she's sticking with her hometown heroes, the Chiefs. But what about a groundhog? This one at the Turtle Back Zoo in New Jersey said, forget wintertime, she's got the Eagles as champ. Let's keep in touch this weekend. I'm @coywire on Insta, Snapchat and TikTok. We want to give a special shout out to Marrington middle school of the Arts in Goose Creek, South Carolina, we see you.

WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, lovely people? Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, where we put together the best minutes in news for you. So let's maximize these moments, get a little smarter and wiser and have a little fun while doing it. We start today's episode by talking about the air up there.  Is it just me or does it feel like America just can't escape these mysterious threats we've been seeing from the sky? It started a week ago with the incident involving a suspected Chinese spy balloon which was shot down off the South Carolina coast on February 4th, and the deepening national security mystery keeps evolving with U.S. fighter jets blasting three unidentified objects out of the skies three days in a row now.  The latest incident was a high altitude object shot down on Sunday by an F- 16 over Lake Huron which lies between Michigan and Ontario. On Saturday, a missile took down an object flying at 40,000 feet over Central Yukon, way up in northwestern Canada.  And that's just some of the aerial action that's happened in the last few days. No one within the Pentagon, the White House or the government of Canada seems to be able to say what exactly in the world is going on.  We'll hear from CNN White House reporter Natasha Bertrand who's been following this story and in the coming weeks as this story continues to unfold, you know we'll keep you up to date right here on CNN 10.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER (voice-over):  The U.S. on edge, dispatching fighter jets to shoot down yet another mysterious object near Michigan's Lake Huron on Sunday. The incident is the third time in as many days that the U.S. military has shot down an unidentified object that was assessed to pose a risk to civilian aircraft and unprecedented series of events. GEN. GLEN VANHERCK, COMMANDER OF NORAD AND USNORTHCOM:  I believe this is the first time within the United States of America airspace that NORAD or United States northern command has taken kinetic action against an airborne object. BERTRAND:  On Friday and Saturday, U.S. jets shot down two more objects near Alaska and over northern Canada. Those objects were flying at around forty thousand feet and had balloon-like features with a small metal cylinder underneath officials said. Sunday's object over Lake Huron was flying at around twenty thousand feet and it was described by officials as octagonal with potential surveillance capabilities. The incidents have sparked confusion and prompted bipartisan criticism from lawmakers. REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT), RANKING, INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I have real concerns about why the administration is not being more forthcoming with everything that it knows. But part of the problem here is that the both of the second and the third objects were shot down in very remote areas. So, my guess is that that there's just not a lot of information out there yet to share. BERTRAND:  After a Chinese spy balloon transited the U.S. earlier this month and was also shot down, the North American aerospace defense command readjusted its filters to better spot slow-moving targets operating above a certain altitude officials said, which may be leading to more detections.  But officials say they won't know more about the objects until they can recover and analyze all of the debris. The incidents have also raised questions about whether similar objects have simply gone undetected in the past and whether shooting each one down is the right response. REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH):  What's been come clear in the public discussion is that we don't really have adequate radar systems. We certainly don't have an integrated missile defense system. We're going to have to begin to look at the United States airspace as one that we need to defend and that we need to have appropriate sensors to do so. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Of the original 13 colonies, which was the last to be established? Georgia, Rhode Island, North Carolina or Virginia? Founded in 1732, Georgia was created as a buffer between South Carolina and the Spanish in Florida. Up next, we're headed to the barrier islands off southeastern Georgia. The region is home to miles of undeveloped beaches, seaside forests, salt marshes and a proposed spaceport hoping to launch rockets directly over the national seashore. This has been quite the controversial topic as you can imagine for nearby communities.  The residents, they don't want their serene and undisturbed lands to be altered. Let's go on the ground to this beautiful region for more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIM RENNER, RESIDENT:  Directly across the river right there in those trees, that's the spaceport site and actually the proposed launch pad site. It's crazy to propose to launch rockets over Cumberland Island national seashore.  REPORTER:  This is Cumberland Island and Little Cumberland Island. They're two barrier islands that form part of a wildlife sanctuary off the southeastern coast of Georgia, but a proposed spaceport is hoping to send rockets directly over the national seashore, altering the horizon and stirring controversy in the secluded community. The proposed rocket would also travel over private homes on Little Cumberland Island. This is something that's unprecedented. SUE HUFF, RESIDENT:  My house is five miles downrange from the launch pad. My understanding is I'm directly in the middle of the cone. The fear of rockets going over my head is the failure rate. And with a high failure rate, the concern is debris falling on my property on me. REPORTER:  Small class rockets like the one Spaceport Camden hopes to launch can have up to a 20 percent failure rate. Several of these small class rockets have experienced issues in recent years, showing what can happen when these types of rockets fail.  The odds of a direct impact crash are extremely low, but many residents feel there is no acceptable amount of risk when humans are in the rocket's path. RENNER:  This is part of the Cumberland Island national seashore, and the idea that Camden County thinks they can safely launch rockets over an area like this where there's no opportunity to monitor whether people are here or not, there's no opportunity to bring firefighting equipment on here and to fight a fire in maritime forests like this, it's just ridiculous. So this is a firebox, one of several that we have stationed along the trails around Little Cumberland Island.  This is our fire station. We've got slappers for putting out if there's a, you know, flames in a ground fire, rakes and they've got a hand operated pump. So take that exploding rocket. STEVE HOWARD, FORMER SPACEPORT CAMDEN PROJECT LEAD:  There's all kinds of you know risks that you have to look at and you have to evaluate it, all those things will be looked at when a company comes forward. You have to prepare for all those things, but they're very remote that that would happen the likelihood of somebody getting hurt worse. Numbers I looked at range from between and million to one in a billion with a B. This is more than just launching rockets. It's about all the opportunities to inspire the next generation. Spaceport Camden will become the Silicon marsh of the East Coast. REPORTER:  In addition to the safety concerns, skeptics point out that the outcome of space will come in is by no means guaranteed and therefore not worth the hefty price tag. Camden County has spent more than $12 million dollars on the project over the last decade. That's taxpayer money some residents say they wish could be spent elsewhere.  The FAA has licensed 14 spaceports across the United States but Spaceport Camden would be the first private spaceport to launch rockets vertically over U.S. citizens a few miles away.  And then there's the potential ecological risks within national park in the proposed trajectory. HOWARD:  What you do in a launch side application process is really a represented rocket. We hope some of those companies at some point will actually come here, you know, in the future. But at this point, it'd be representative. It was never about the rockets that becomes a catalyst economic driver, but you want all this innovation, you want all this high- tech opportunity. You want to drive that innovation and lift up the whole coast of Georgia. REPORTER:  After a series of delays, the county secured a spaceport operator license from the FAA in late 2021. But Camden County residents petitioned for a special election where they overwhelmingly voted to block the county from purchasing the land for the spaceport. In February 2023, Georgia's Supreme Court unanimously rejected an appeal by Camden County officials, preventing the coastal community from moving forward with the spaceport.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Wonderful Wednesday to you. It's your boy Coy. Grateful to be spending part of our day right here with you on CNN 10. You know, sometimes when tragedy strikes, it can serve as a reminder that we should never take any of the moments we're given for granted. We're starting with an update on the earthquake that has shattered families in Turkey and Syria. The 7.8 magnitude quake had taken the lives of more than 36,000 people as of the time of this show's recording. Tens of thousands more are injured. The latest report from Turkey's health ministry said more than 19,000 people were hospitalized with injuries sustained from the disaster in more than one thousand children in Turkey were separated from their parents. More than a week now after the earthquake struck and rescuers are still working around the clock in hopes of saving lives. Seven more people were rescued from the rubble yesterday but hopes of finding further survivors dwindle with every second that passes. The reality is that survival stories are becoming few and far between as rescue operations start to shift recovery efforts. And for many in Syria, the earthquake is just the latest in a decade-long series of tragedies. In recent years, the country has been torn apart and 1.7 million people are living in tents in refugee camps. CNN's Nada Bashir is in Istanbul where a massive effort to send aid is currently underway. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, a week on since Turkey was struck by devastating earthquake on Monday, and aid centers like this one here are still being filled with volunteers, with donations to be distributed to those impacted by the earthquake. And as you can see here, boxes and boxes are being filled up with life-saving humanitarian assistance, and crucial donations for those impacted by the earth (INAUDIBLE), clothes, blankets, to toiletries, anything that someone who has been made homeless, displaced by the devastation could need in order to survive over the next few weeks. And there are aid centers like this one you can see the sheer scale of this hangar where the aid donations are coming in. There are centers like this across the country because of course as we are still seeing the death tolls rising and we are still seeing miraculously survivors being pulled out of the rubble. This is now becoming more of a recovery effort than a rescue effort and there are of course thousands and thousands of people, of families, extremely vulnerable now, desperately in need, hugely dependent on that humanitarian assistance between aid groups from across the globe, traveling into Turkey to support in that effort. And here in Istanbul, it's not just the international aid that's coming in, and there's Turks, it's people from this country piling into centers like this one to provide those donations. There is a real sense of unity here, people really want to help and of course there are so many in need. The question of what's also now relating to northwest Syria, getting aid across the border there, through the Bab al-Hawa crossing, there has been some logistical challenges as well as diplomatic challenges in getting the aid across the northwest Syria. That now seems to be coming through. And, of course, we are also now beginning to see evacuations. People and families being evacuated from the impacted southeast region of Turkey to even here in Istanbul where they will be sheltered over the next few weeks, many of them of course now displaced homeless with nowhere else to go. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: "Girl With a Pearl Earring" is a famous painting by what artist? Johannes Vermeer, Leonardo da Vinci, Vincent van Gogh or Michelangelo? Often compared to the "Mona Lisa", Johannesburg Vermeer painted "Girl With a Pearl Earring" in around 1665. That painting is now part of an unprecedented show at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The museum is putting on the largest showcase of Vermeer paintings in our lifetime. Twenty-eight of the artist's 37 attributed works are on display, even Vermeer himself did not see that many of his paintings together all at one time. Tickets for the event are sold out, but lucky us, CNN's Nick Glass is taking us inside the exhibit to check it out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK GLASS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For a glorious 90 minutes, we had the place to ourselves. Vermeer's paintings, their beauty, their size demand intimacy and quiet. And here was an opportunity to spend quality time with his most famous creation. This is rare. I've been an arts score (ph), it's -- one for something like 20 years, and to be alone with a painting like this "Girl With a Pearl Erring", it's extraordinary and she's not alone. The Rijksmuseum has pulled off an astonishing artistic coup, the greatest Vermeer show of this or any other lifetime, 28 of the 34 to 37 attributed works. Vermeer himself would never have seen so many of his paintings altogether in one place. TACO DIBBITS, DIRECTOR, RIJKSMUSEUM:  It's very exciting. I've -- it kind of had this dream of having all the paintings together. Obviously, they're only about 37 paintings by Vermeer but having 28 here is just something we would have never saw possible. GLASS:  "The Lacemaker" from the Louvre in Paris, "Girl With the Red Hat" from the National Gallery in Washington, "Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window" from the Gemaldegalerie in Dresden, Germany. GREGOR WEBER, CO-CURATOR, RIJKSMUSEUM:  Remember that I saw for the first time two paintings by Vermeer from the National Gallery London, and I think I fainted a little bit with such a glowing light in the paintings. And since then, I feel busy with Vermeer. GLASS:  Vermeer has been under intense scrutiny in another way in the lab under infrared and other light. They've adapted specialist techniques first used by NASA to map minerals on Mars and the moon. It amounts to non- invasive fine art archeology. IGE VERSLYPE, PAINTINGS CONSERVATOR, RIKSMUSEUM:  It's as if you're looking over his shoulder and seeing what he's doing. GLASS:  We didn't know it, but Vermeer never stopped experimenting. ANNA KREKELER, PAINTINGS CONSERVATOR, RIJKSMUSEUM:  If you see the underlying paint layers for example, the underpaint, he really put on kind of fast and rough brush strokes to define light and shadow. For example, in the tablecloth, you have areas where he -- where there's black underpaint like here and here, right the darkest shadows, and then on top where the light hits the table, he used a wide underpaint. GLASS:  And behind her on the wall -- KREKELER:  Here was a fire basket, a large element to dry your clothes, and then here was a -- was a jock rack with ducks hanging on it. GLASS:  We've known for a long time that Vermeer was a genius with paints and a brush, but only now are we beginning to understand how precisely he did it. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Well, the Super Bowl is behind us, and I got to meet some pretty cool people in Arizona, like Miss Levrenz (ph). Shout outs to Cocopah Middle School. I also got to see Super Bowl traditions. Today's story getting a 10 out of 10, the Puppy Bowl. Year 19 of the clash of canines took place on Sunday, featuring team Ruff versus team Fluff. A hundred and twenty-two pumped up pups from rescues and shelters across the country, this year's game was intense. Penalty flags thrown for unnecessary roughness and for excessive cuteness. For the first time ever, the Puppy Bowl went into overtime this year and it was team Fluff wagging their way to the win 87-83. Today is hashtag your word Wednesday.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. It's Thursday. So happy Friday Eve. It's your boy Coy, aka Mr. Clean. Let's aim to be a little better today than we were yesterday and we can start by fueling our minds right here on CNN 10. First up, the inflation situation. Headline is: inflation surged in January, and by the most we'd seen in three months. As a reminder, inflation is a rise in prices and decline in the ability to purchase. It's like if someone gives you twenty dollars, you go to the movies. But the cost of a movie ticket is now $17 and last year, it was only $15 for a movie at your local theater. Rising inflation means that your twenty dollars just won't get you as much as it used to. But despite the fact that inflation costs grew this month, they've continued to slow for the year overall. But economists are bracing for uncertainty and it seems like no one not even the experts have any clue what's going to happen next. And part of this is because so many factors contribute to what makes up inflation. All economists know is that inflation has changed household budgets and altered American spending habits, especially in terms of discretionary spending. That means extra money to spend on entertainment, eating out and travel. We'll hear now from CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich who has more on what's happening in the market. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  It's been a bumpy road to cool inflation and a longer road than many Americans would like to see. But some good news, year-over-year inflation cooled to 6.4 percent falling for seven straight months. But inflation in January rose 0.5 percent and inflation and the economy have been key issues for President Biden. And coming off this report, he said that it is good news but there is still work to do as inflation remains too high. So the biggest inflation drivers were energy costs, which includes gas, up 1.5 percent from a year ago, shelter which contributed to nearly half the increase last month, that rose 7.9 percent year over year. And food costs remaining extremely high, up 10.1 percent year over year. Some key items at the grocery store costing more eggs up 70 percent, butter up 26.3 percent, and lettuce up 17.2 percent year over year. But you'll see some savings on a couple items at the grocery store -- beef, veal and bacon, all down year over year. So how does this translate to Americans budgets? Well, according to Moody's Analytics, families are spending nearly four hundred dollars more a month this year than they did last year on the same goods and services because of inflation. So this signals that there is still work for the Federal Reserve to do. We can expect continued interest rate hikes to try to bring down inflation in the months to come. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUBTITLE:  A deadly 7.8 magnitude earthquake created this chasm in the middle of a Turkish olive grove. The chasm is 130 feet (40 meters) deep and more than 900 feet (274 meters) long. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  This earthquake was beyond belief. Of course, you might get some mild tremors or an average earthquake. But we've never seen anything so explosive, or tremors of these proportions. SUBTITLE:  One in every two buildings in this region have either collapsed, are damaged or need demolition. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these words comes from a Latin term meaning "to send out"? Edify, embody, emit or encompass? Meaning to throw or give off, emit is your answer here. It's derived from the Latin word emittere. Up next, we're going to meet a climate scientist who's been researching and tracking dust for decades. That's right, dust. She tells us that those tiny particulates can essentially create change of Brobdingnag in proportions across the globe. The company SpaceX just launched with EMIT on board, a special instrument from NASA that'll help scientists learn more about how dust is affecting our atmosphere. CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar shows us how we're going to learn more about dust from space. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice-over):  In July 2022, this SpaceX rocket launched with a new NASA instrument called EMIT on board. NATALIE MAHOWALD, PROFESSOR OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE/CORNELL UNIVERSITY:  Well, EMIT is going to revolutionize what we can do. So it's just going to provide such amazing new data to help us understand the surface and the atmosphere. CHINCHAR:  Now, over 250 miles above the Earth, attached to the International Space Station, its purpose is to shed light on an important weather phenomenon -- dust. MAHOWALD:  Desert dust or mineral aerosols is a mineral soil particle that's suspended in the atmosphere. And so, these come out mostly from desert regions that are dry and unvegetated with strong winds. CHINCHAR:  For over two decades, climate scientist Natalie Mahowald has been tracking dust across the globe and how it impacts climate change. MAHOWALD:  I love looking at a globe and thinking about how dust is getting from one place to another. CHINCHAR:  She's been working with NASA on this new instrument to find out how different colors of dust in the atmosphere can heat or cool the planet. MAHOWALD:  So different soils actually have really different colors. So the white ones reflect incoming solar radiation and the red ones and the dark ones absorb it. So one of the problems we have in understanding the impact of desert dust is we don't know the composition very well. CHINCHAR:  Using a device called an imaging spectrometer, EMIT scans the Earth's arid regions to detect different colored soils, creating a mineral map. MAHOWALD:  Already, EMIT has taken millions or billions of observations of what's going on in the arid regions in terms of the composition. And then we can use that to put into our models, to better understand what actually the impact of the desert dust is. CHINCHAR:  Dust and sandstorms have dramatically increased in recent years due to climate change, land degradation, and drought, according to the U.N. These storms are causing respiratory illnesses, damaging livestock, disrupting transport and even melting arctic ice. MAHOWALD:  We've also watched dust plumes really just travel across oceans and be deposited in Greenland or even in the Alps. CHINCHAR:  EMIT can also detect another factor impacting climate change -- methane, a potent greenhouse gas. It's detected 50 super emitters across the world, mostly coming from fossil fuel, landfill and agricultural facilities. NASA hopes this knowledge can help countries stem the emissions and shine a spotlight on how our planet is changing. MAHOWALD:  So you can think of the EMIT project as really testing the waters and really showing what is possible. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, the ghost yacht. A 53- foot ship sat eerily abandoned in a marina at Kent Narrows, Maryland, for decades. It was nicknamed the "Ghost Yacht". But now, the mysterious yacht is being reimagined. The state's artificial reef program sunk the vessel to the bottom of the Chesapeake Bay this past week as one of Maryland's artificial reefs. The hope is that it'll become a habitat for all sorts of fish and underwater creatures and provide an underwater treasure for scuba divers. Kind of like a sunken pirate ship. All right. Dad joke alert, what did the pirate say when he turned 80? I'm 80. I want to give a special salute to all of you lovely people who made a #YourWordWednesday submission. Thanks to the likes of @laurensandrasrq. Today's word was Brobdingnagian if you didn't notice, which means gigantic. And we want to give a Brobdingnagian shout out to Woodbridge Middle School in Bridgeville, Delaware, rise up. Have an awesome day, lovely people, or maybe an all a lot day.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. You made it. The weekend is upon us. Friday is here and Friday's rock, especially this Friday because we're headed into a three-day weekend. We have a lot of news to get through today, so not a lot of time to do it. Let's get to it. We're going to begin with the latest out of New Zealand where the country just declared a national state of emergency. Cyclone Gabrielle hit New Zealand with wind and rain, knocking out power to tens of thousands of homes in the area. The wind gusts were greater than 87 miles per hour, waves were close to 36 feet high. When we recorded this show the storm had killed at least five people and caused widespread damage. Police in the area say they remain focused on locating those people that are unaccounted for. What exactly is a cyclone? Let's break it down. Cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons are essentially the same, with only the location of the storm determining what we call it. For example, the only difference between a hurricane and a typhoon is that typhoons happen in the Western and North Pacific waters, while hurricanes occur in the Eastern and North Pacific and the North Atlantic Basin. That's why whenever we talk about these types of storms in the U.S., it's almost always a hurricane. Cyclones happen only in the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific. We'll keep you updated as news unfold surrounding the cyclone in New Zealand as the worst of the weather looks to have passed significant and potentially life-threatening challenges remain. Next story today, earlier this month, a Norfolk Southern train which was carrying toxic chemicals at the time derailed from the tracks and crashed in eastern Ohio. Now, the derailment ignited the hazardous chemicals on board, covering the town of East Palestine with smoke. Authorities created an evacuation zone around the crash and fearing a major explosion performed a controlled release of the chemicals. Weeks later, residents have been encouraged to return home, but there are lots of questions about just how harmful exposure to these chemicals could be. The plumes of smoke from the explosion carry the hazardous material into the air and water to which residents would be exposed. With all eyes on Ohio, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator otherwise known as EPA, Michael Regan, visited the region on Thursday to assess the ongoing response and hear from impacted residents. Here's CNN's national correspondent Jason Carroll who's been on the ground in Ohio for the last few days covering this story for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. BRUCE VANDERHOOF, DIRECTOR, OHIO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH:  We are strongly recommending those who have not yet had their water source checked to use bottled water. And bottled water is being made available. JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  More than a week after a toxic train derailment that led to the evacuation of much of this small Ohio town, state health officials are urging some East Palestine residents to drink bottled water until water tests are complete. Officials say the toxic spill was largely contained the day after the derailment and that tests have shown the air quality is safe. But they have found low levels of contaminants in four nearby waterways spanning seven and a half miles, including Leslie Run, a creek which runs through East Palestine and neighboring Negli (ph), right through the back of Kathy Reese's (ph) property. (on camera):  In the back of your property back here, they found dead fish? KATHY REESE (ph), EAST PALESTINE RESIDENT:  Yes, they saw dead fish. CARROLL:  Reese says she has been drinking bottled water instead of well water ever since she started spotting dead fish in the creek following the derailment. She says she's still waiting for the state to come and test her well water. REESE:  Air wise, I feel OK. Water wise, no. No. There's just too many chemicals and stuff that were spilled that they still don't want to identify completely. CARROLL:  An Ohio Department of Natural Resources official estimates some 3,500 fish in the state have died following the train derailment. These people saw the flames from their homes and worried their neighborhood still may not be safe. What about testing water or ground? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nothing yet. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And I get that I don't recommend you put anything in the ground. I mean, vegetables or tomatoes or anything this year because we don't know. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't think they're going to do enough. CARROLL:  And some residents say they have been frustrated by what they describe as a lack of communication with officials on the ground. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We pass all of the creeks and there's crew after crew with white hoses and black hoses all through the creeks, they're not telling us why, and this is daily. I'm driving my children to school past all of this and they're asking me questions that I don't have answers to. CARROLL:  Some of their questions unanswered. We found getting information just as challenging. OK, just tell me, are they pumping water out or pumping water back in? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You can talk to the guys up in top of the hill, sir. We're just grunts. CARROLL:  We're just trying to get a sense of what those pumps are. Can just -- someone just -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Norfolk Southern can tell you everything. That's the hotline. They can tell you everything. CARROLL:  But you realize people are calling this number and no one is getting back to them. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're just told to direct people to that number. CARROLL:  The governor asked by reporters Tuesday if he would feel comfortable living in East Palestine. GOV. MIKE DEWINE (R), OHIO:  I think that I would be drinking the bottled water. And I would be continuing to find out what the tests were showing as far as the air. I would be alert and concerned, but I think I would probably be back in my house. CARROLL:  But residents like Kathy Reese say they are left with few choices. REESE:  Just, I guess, pray and keep drink a bottled water until we know for sure what's going on. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these is the most visited urban park in the U.S.? Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, D.C.'s National Mall, Central Park in New York or the Lincoln Park in Chicago. With 40 million annual visitors, Central Park is the most visited city park in the U.S. The park is also home to a wide range of wildlife as you can imagine but a newcomer is getting most of the attention right now. Flaco, the owl, escaped from the Central Park Zoo and is at large and on the loose in the park. The rare Eurasian eagle owl escaped his enclosure on February 2nd, and since then, zoo officials have kept an eye on the bird which has become a bit of a celebrity. While Flaco seems to be adapting well to the wild, there are some concerns over how he might adapt to that New York City lifestyle. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  There's a new star in Central Park and he's right out of central casting. Lately, bird watchers only have eyes for owls. And some fans on David Barrett's burger blog are saying. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Let Flaco be free. MOOS:  In the beginning of February Flaco escaped from his exhibit at the Central Park Zoo after someone cut through the stainless steel mesh. His enclosure didn't have room to do much flying. In his first night of freedom, the NYPD almost corralled him on a Fifth Avenue sidewalk. "Well, that was a hoot," the NYPD tweeted when the owl flew off. EDMUND BERRY, BIRDER EYEWITNESS:  I was worried that it wouldn't be able to fly but it spread its wings and flew to the nearest set of trees. MOOS:  Zoo officials were most worried that Flaco didn't know how to hunt since he's always had his meals delivered. They tried to learn them using a white wrapped in a cage hoping he gets trapped in the wiry filaments on top. DAVID BARRETT, MANHATTAN BIRD ALERT:  The zoo team was rushing with nets to get Flaco but Flaco was too fast. MOOS:  And now fans are snapping photos of Flaco catching his own dinner. BARRETT:  Rats. MOOS:  Rats on the menu. Barrett says the owl's gone from zero hunting skills to decent hunting skills. BARRETT:  That's just an incredible transformation. MOOS:  He hangs out in Central Park charming New Yorkers with hooting so low it requires subtitles. Like other creatures not native to Central Park, Flaco the Eurasian Eagle Owl has become one of the select few. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. I know you are all ready to flee for the weekend like Flaco. Monday is President's Day. So no show that day. Originally established in 1885 in recognition of President George Washington, the U.S. holiday now recognizes all presidents past and present. Fairmont, West Virginia, you're getting the shout out today. East Fairmont Middle School -- rise up, Hornets. Have a wonderful weekend, everyone, and remember you are more powerful than you know. It's been a blessing to spend this week with you. END230220

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you.  It's your boy Coy. I hope you had a wonderful weekend and a pleasant President's Day holiday. I am pumped to be back here with you to start this week off strong.  We're going to begin with the latest news out of Ukraine. This week, President Biden made an unexpected visit to Kyiv. It was his first visit since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost a year ago. Here's part of what the president had to say about this trip: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  That dark night one year ago, the world was literally at the time bracing for the fall of Kyiv. One year later, Kyiv stands, and Ukraine stands, democracy stands. The Americans stand with you and the world stands with you. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Now, there is a long history of American presidents visiting war zones. This trip was unprecedented in modern history however because the American president traveled to an active war zone without a large U.S. military presence. President Biden said his trip was to reaffirm the, quote, unwavering support that the United States holds for Ukraine. But, earlier this month, the United States said Russia has committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine. That was an escalation of what they'd said previously. Russia called the accusation an excuse for Washington to further the conflict. During his trip, President Biden also announced new military assistance for Ukraine and incoming sanctions against Moscow. We'll keep you informed on any more updates from the president's trip as well as new information on the ongoing war overseas. And over the weekend, the secretive nation of North Korea launched a series of missile tests off the coast of the Korean peninsula. The country says the missiles have enough range to hit the United States. But the U.S. has said this weekend's events, they don't pose any immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory.  The tests do however highlight the destabilizing impact of North Korea's illegal missile program. North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un's sister warned of more threats to come unless the United States halts military drills with South Korea.  More now from Paula Hancocks, CNN international correspondent based in Seoul, South Korea. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It has been a busy few days on the Korean peninsula. North Korea on Saturday launching a significant missile. On Sunday and Monday, we have seen tit-for-tat retaliation from both sides -- North Korea, and also the U.S. and South Korea on the other side. So what we saw on Saturday, Pyongyang admitted a day later, was an intercontinental ballistic missile. Now these they claim can hit mainland United States and they are the ones that do concern Washington. We heard from Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un's sister, that this actually shows that they have missile re-entry technology.  Now, it's very difficult to know if that is in fact the case, but that is what Pyongyang is claiming at this point. So what we saw on Sunday then just one day later was a concerted show of force by the U.S. and South Korean air force, air forces. They flew sorties over the Korean peninsula, including at least one B-1 bomber, escorted by South Korean fighter jets and then in response to that, we saw this Monday morning from Pyongyang two launches.  Now they say that it was a super large multiple rocket launcher exercise in retaliation for what they saw the day before. So this is really a latest cycle of tit-for-tat retaliation, but certainly, the Saturday launch was the significant one. But we're not expecting the tensions or this tit for tat retaliation to diminish anytime soon, because Pyongyang says it is doing so because the U.S. and South Korea are carrying out joint military drills, and if they continue to do that, then they will continue to respond.  Now we know that this week at the Pentagon, there will be a nuclear tabletop drill between the U.S. and South Korea, and then next month, there will be a larger joint military drill between the two countries. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, we're traveling to Canada in search of zombies but not the type of zombies you'd typically think of. Ever heard of zombie fires, I had neither until now. They're essentially fires that were never totally put out at the end of a fire season and they burn underground threatening to come back from beneath the surface at any moment to wreak havoc once more. We'll hear more now from an international team of researchers who are on the hunt for the next fire that could be lurking beneath the earth's surface. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  In the remote boreal forests of Canada's Northwest Territories, and Rebecca Scholten, along with an international team of researchers, is on the hunt for signs of a rare and destructive phenomenon.  REBECCA SCHOLTEN, PHD STUDENT, VU AMSTERDAM:  So the first thing you notice when you get to a site that has had a zombie fire is that a lot of these trees have fallen over and that is because of the underground burning that is happening. REPORTER:  In 2015, this region of boreal forest was the scene of an overwintering fire also known as a zombie fire. These are rare so we don't have any footage of them but they can look just like these regular forest fires, except they're back from the dead. SCHOLTEN:  So these are fires that are not extinguished at the end of a fire season but instead, they smoldered deep into the organic soil layer and when the snow comes the snow kind of protects them from the adverse winter conditions and that makes it possible for them to smolder or throughout winter and when the snow melts and there's dry fuels available again these fires come up to the surface again and start a new flaming forest fire. REPORTER:  In 2021, Scholten published the first ever scientific study to detect zombie fires using satellites and reports from local fire managers as part of her PhD.  For example, in the summer of 2015, a fire in southwest Alaska blazed across 26 square miles. Winter came and snow covered the fire site. But the following spring, the fire returned along the old burn scar, evidence Scholten says of a zombie fire.  By burning through the soil and the roots, zombie fires can be more damaging to the forest than regular fires, making it harder for them to recover. But that's not all, these boreal soils store huge amounts of carbon, so burning them releases it as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Zombie fires are rare but Scholten found that they are increasing due to climate change. SCHOLTEN:  So I think zombie fires a very good poster child for what is happening to arctic wildfires in general. So we see fire regimes are intensifying and this has very important impact on the ecosystems that of course has an impact on our climate. And that is why I think everyone in the world should care about these fires. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these words comes from a Latin term that described a wind from the north? Zephyr, bluster, boreal, or arboreal? Zephyr was a west wind but when you're talking about a north wind, you're speaking in boreal terms.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh, yeah, it's going all the way. Oh, yeah, right above, wow look at how bright that is. SUBTITLE:  This erupting aurora was caught on camera in Alaska. Particles from explosions on the sun interact with atmospheric gases, creating the mesmerizing light displays.  Vincent Ledvina, a doctoral student in space physics, has been photographic polar lights for years. (MUSIC) (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. Today's story getting a 10 out of 10, a shark attack, only this time, it's the shark getting attacked by a dog. That's right, a big old hammerhead shark. One boater said it was probably about feet long, just minding this business in the Bahamas until a dog spots the monster cruising beneath the surface and cannonball, the dog jumps into the water and starts chasing the shark away. The people on the tour boat were screaming in disbelief in horror the dog is the pet of the caretaker who manages the private island.  Pardon my sarcasm little doggy, but something tells me year one jawsitively lucky pup. The boaters were relieved when the dog safely swam back to the shore unharmed. Fun fact for the day: did you know that baby sharks are called pups? Learn something new every day. Shout out time now. Hudsonville High School in Hudsonville, Michigan, we see you.  Also shout out to Mr. Ben Lewis at Brenham Middle School in Brenham, Texas. He challenged his students to interview a military veteran an immigrant and an American citizen over 60 years old. To learn about different perspectives and to gain better understanding of what it means to be an American, he turned the interviews into this book. Proceeds are going to help deserving military veterans.  We salute you, Mr. Lewis, and to all of the students who sent me a lovely note with all these signatures, you totally rocked it out.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Wonderful Wednesday to you. I'm Coy Wire, and we are so grateful that you're making us part of your day right here on CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news. Random thought for you before we start. Why is it that we park on a driveway, but we drive on a parkway? All right. Let's shift into high gear now. We start today with more on President Biden's visit to Ukraine. On Tuesday, the president gave a speech in Poland after making a surprise visit to Ukraine on Monday, nearly one year after Russia started its invasion there. The president recommitted the support of the United States and its resources to Ukraine. This despite the rising costs of sending aid. The U.S. has already given about $30 billion and recent polls show public support for America continuing to send weapons to Ukraine is fading as well, down to 48 percent last month when 60 percent of Americans supported it back in May. Just hours earlier on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin slammed the West in his annual state of the nation Address in Moscow, casting Russia as the victim, saying that it was Ukraine and its Western allies who started the war. He says Russia's military efforts in Ukraine are to protect themselves and Putin offered no signs of backing down from their presence in Ukraine. So why did President Biden risk entering an active war zone that isn't showing any signs of settling down in the near future? Biden was not the first president to make a trip to a war zone, but he is the first to do so without a U.S. military presence in the region to protect him. Here's CNN's Brian Todd to tell us about other U.S. presidents who traveled to war zones and why they did that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It was at the height of World War II and the conflict still wasn't going America's way. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt engaged in a high-stakes game of misdirection, tricking journalists into thinking he was taking a train to his home in Upstate New York, but he secretly switched trains in Baltimore, headed to Miami, then took a series of arduous plane hops and ended up in Casablanca, Morocco. It was January 1943, the first time a sitting American president rode on an airplane, a trip shrouded in secrecy so that FDR could strategize with Winston Churchill, a journey fraught with danger. TIM NAFTALI, CNN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  In World War II, you not only had the possibility of the commander-in-chief being shot down, but the technology was such that air travel was not as safe in the 1940s as it is today. TODD:  Some U.S. troops in Morocco didn't know their president was coming until he rode past them in a Jeep. Historians say war zone trips for American presidents have always been complicated, even dating back to the civil war. LINDSAY CHERVINSKY, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  At least presidents have gone to war zones in the past starting of course with Abraham Lincoln in the civil war. There are those famous pictures of him in his top hat visiting union soldiers to boost their morale. But it is a big risk. TODD:  Lyndon B. Johnson went twice as president. Richard Nixon once to Vietnam while the war there was raging. DOUGLAS BRINKLEY, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN, RICE UNIVERSITY:  I know when Nixon went in 1969 to Saigon, all of his advisors were saying don't do it, it's too dangerous. TODD:  George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump went to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit U.S. troops. NAFTALI:  When those presidents went to Kabul and Baghdad respectively, they were taking huge risks. TODD:  When George H.W. Bush as a former president visited Kuwait in 1993, Saddam Hussein's intelligence service tried to have Iraqi operatives assassinate him, a plot that was narrowly foiled. Presidents have taken these risks to boost troops morale, to strategize with other commanders and sometimes to decide whether a war should even continue. DWIGHT EISENHOWER, FORMER PRESIDENT:  I shall go to Korea. TODD:  That was Dwight D. Eisenhower's objective as president-elect when he took a secret trip to South Korea in December 1952. NAFTALI:  Eisenhower not only went to meet the troops, not only went to meet the South Korean leader, but actually took a plane over Chinese and North Korean positions to get a view himself of the nature of their defenses. That's an extremely hazardous trip. (END VIDEOTAPE) TODD (on camera):  Historian Tim Naftali says despite the sometimes- incredible risks, the rewards are very high, that as commander-in-chief, it's crucial for a president to show their commitment to the fight and to show that not only to American forces but to their adversaries as well. WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: What Italian city is also known by the nickname La Serenissima? Palermo, Genoa, Venice or Florence? Meaning serene, La Serenissima was a nickname for the Republic of Venice. Ah, Venice, the floating city with people being serenaded and gondolas as they drift through winding canals under hundreds of walkways and bridges. But those famous canals look a lot different right now. They're so dried up that many of the gondolas and water taxis are sadly sitting on empty waterways. And there are fears that Italy will face a drought for a second straight summer following an extremely dry winter. Now, these images are a stark contrast from those of just a few years ago. In 2019, water poured into restaurants, shops and famous landmarks like Saint Mark's Basilica in Venice as it battled its worst flood in 50 years. Here's reporting from CNN international correspondent Scott McLean during that time as we try to imagine the scope of issues Venetians had to deal with the last several years. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  High tide on Saturday was actually welcome relief for Venetians struggling with the worst flooding in half a century. It filled historic Saint Mark's Square but was not enough to do more damage than already done. This cafe opened for the first time since Tuesday's high watermark sent more than a foot of water inside enough to break the dishwasher and the fridge. This waiter told us, we are Venetians, roll up our sleeves and start working again. Venice is our lady; we will protect her. Meanwhile at Saint Mark's Basilica, the water at the door didn't knock before entering. But it still got their attention. PIERPAOLO CAMPOSTRINI, ST. MARK'S BASILICA BOARD MEMBER:  We have a -- we have more than this level of water. MCLEAN:  It's not uncommon for water to enter the outer atrium. It was even a special drainage system to handle it. But Pierpaolo Campostrini says it was just the second time there's been significant flooding in the main chamber. Ten centimeters there and another meter in the crypt the water came and went quickly but the salt in the water stays in the 900-year-old walls much longer, eating away at the marble and brick near the floor and even on the mosaic ceiling. And that's the damage. CAMPOSTRINI:  And that's the damage. MCLEAN:  The basilica has survived centuries of threats but nothing like the one it faces today. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's story getting a 10 out of 10, you're going to meet George, a young Detroit Red Wings fan who went to his very first game and he and his mom were in for a huge surprise when George became a big time hit on the jumbotron. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It was George's first hockey game and the jumbotron eat him up. Detroit Red Wing fans booing. Opposing fans from Vancouver cheering. Every time George came up, even if he didn't quite get it, the opposition -- (BOOS) MOOS:  The home team -- (CHEERS) MOOS:  George finally cracked a smile and went viral. King George, they called him. I see a George bobblehead night. But it didn't give George a big head. CHELSEA MILLER, MOM:  Like he didn't know it was about him, and just kept saying like, yes, red team's winning. MOOS:  Chelsea Miller describes her four-year-old son as shy amid a whirlwind of attention. MILLER:  There were probably at least 100 people that asked to stop to take pictures with him and high fives and can I get an autograph even. MOOS:  Mom says they were hoping his sign would get George on camera, but they weren't expecting this. MILLER:  Everyone just made it so special for us. MOOS:  University of Michigan hockey wondered, George, do you need a Michigan jersey for the next game? George's grandma here and he definitely needs a jersey.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, lovely people? It's Thursday. So happy Friday eve and welcome to CNN 10. I'm Coy Wire. Happy to be with you today. Let's dominate this day. We're going to start with big news on the weather front. a massive winter storm is threatening the United States coast to coast all the way from California in the West to Maine in the east. On Wednesday, more than 65 million Americans were under winter weather alerts. Warning of severe icing and extreme cold making driving and flying very dangerous. More than 1,000 flights in the U.S. had already been canceled on Wednesday at the time of the show's taping, and more than 2 million people are under blizzard warnings across parts of Wyoming, the Dakotas, Wisconsin and Minnesota. The Minneapolis area in Minnesota could see historic snowfall totals. On Tuesday, in northern California, strong wind gusts knocked the power out in than 140 homes and businesses. And northern Californians can also expect to see several in inches of snow. We'll continue to track this storm right here on CNN 10, but please, be smart and stay safe. Next up, an update on the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, which spilled toxic chemicals that are threatening the health and well-being of residents there. Wednesday morning, the Environmental Protection Agency ordered Norfolk Southern rail company to cover all of the cleanup costs, but the rail company is facing further pressure. Residents and state officials still have questions about the rail company's handling of the situation, and they seek to hold them accountable for any potential wrongdoing. CNN's Miguel Marquez is in East Palestine with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A toxic mess left by its derailed train, now President Joe Biden adding his pressure on Norfolk Southern, following criticism for his response to the crash. On Instagram, Biden wrote, Norfolk Southern's imposed payments and cleanup operations are common sense because, quote, this is their mess, and they should clean it up. The company is reiterating its commitment to East Palestine residents. ALAN SHAW, CEO, NORFOLK SOUTHERN:  From day one, I've made the commitment that Norfolk Southern is going to remediate the site. MARQUEZ:  But still, it is facing accusations of mismanagement like this from Pennsylvania's Governor Josh Shapiro. GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D), PENNSYLVANIA:  They chose not to participate in the unified command. They gave us inaccurate information and conflicting modeling data. SHAW:  I was at unified command, and I can tell you that the governors of Ohio and Pennsylvania, Mayor Conaway, Fire Chief Drabick, the National Guard and Norfolk Southern were aligned that the control burned, the control release was the safest course of action for the citizens of East Palestine. MARQUEZ:  Governor Shapiro announced a criminal referral to the attorney general's office over the crash and its fallout. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine also said his attorney general is reviewing possible legal action against Norfolk Southern. But the train company says it is committed to helping East Palestine for the long haul. SHAW:  We're going to do continuous long-term air and water monitoring. We're going to help the residents of this community recover and we're going to invest in the long-term health of this community and we're going to make Norfolk Southern a safer railroad. MARQUEZ:  According to its CEO, Norfolk Southern has reimbursed $6.5 million to East Palestine residents so far. This as the company continues to monitor air and water quality there. It says hundreds of tests conducted have come back clean. During a visit to East Palestine, head of the EPA Michael Regan said he's confident in the tests. MICHAEL REGAN, EPA ADMINISTRATOR:  Our data is very solid and if the homes have been cleared and tested for drinking water, then we trust that data. So we feel really good about that. MARQUEZ:  To prove that Regan and Governor DeWine drank from the same water sources that are being tested. However, Governor DeWine says more work needs to be done to remove contaminated soil from the area. GOV. MIKE DEWINE (R), OHIO:  The soil under the tracks had not been dealt with. So, under the administrator's order, that soil will be removed, so the tracks will have to be taken up and that soil will have to be removed. MARQUEZ:  Despite all these actions and guarantees, East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway says his community is still concerned about overall safety. MAYOR TRENT CONAWAY, EAST PALESTINE, OHIO:  We need our whole town cleaned up. We need our residents to feel safe in their homes. That's the number one thing. Your home is your sanctuary. If you don't feel safe in your home, then you're never going to feel safe anywhere. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next up, as part of the fallout from the suspected Chinese spy balloon that flew over the United States earlier this month, the U.S. announced a new round of sanctions or penalties against six Chinese aerospace companies that they believe supported a Chinese military reconnaissance balloon program. Today in a CNN exclusive, Will Ripley takes us to a place few outsiders have seen to try to learn more about what the secretive manufacturers could be up to. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Hundreds of miles from Beijing, a place China does not want you to see. CNN, the first international media to come here. Behind the sea of barbed wire and security checkpoints, the base of a blacklisted balloon manufacturer, one of six Chinese entities the U.S. government sanctioned after that suspected spy balloon. Shot down, pulled up, and sent to an FBI lab, each piece providing more proof, the U.S. says, this was no weather balloon, deflating denial after denial by Beijing. China's foreign ministry calls the whole thing an accident, the balloon, an unmanned civilian airship. CNN searched for the truth behind the balloon, took our team from the Chinese capital to a Shanxi province, about 300 miles southwest of Beijing. Days of digging and geolocation technology took us down this road to a place few outsiders have seen. No international media has ever come this close. What did we find? An active industrial complex with possible ties to the Chinese military's vast, highly secretive aerospace program. Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology, or EMAST, blacklisted by the U.S. Commerce Department. CNN searched corporate records suggesting EMAST has permits to develop and manufacture products for the Chinese military. The first thing we noticed, a giant white dome. A closer look shows the company logo. Inside that dome, a lab. We dug up a 2017 Chinese state media report. The report says this is where workers test high altitude balloons like the one that flew over the U.S. Our team spotted two more massive structures. They look like giant tents. CNN cameras also captured what seems to be an assault helicopter on display. And listen to this. That same state media report never once does it mention meteorology. It boasts the balloons can carry multiple detectors, communications equipment used for civilian and military surveillance and reconnaissance. CNN tried to get answer from all six companies on the U.S. blacklist. No response from EMAST or the others. They are not talking about the balloon, but President Joe Biden is. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I make no apologies for taking down that balloon. RIPLEY:  A suspected spy balloon. We may never know for sure who made it. China is sticking to its weather balloon claim dismissed by the Pentagon as nothing but hot air. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these countries is the world's largest producer of oranges? Mexico, United States, Brazil or Cyprus? About one-third of the world's oranges are grown in Brazil. (MUSIC) WIRE:  It's the annual battle of the oranges at the Ivrea Carnival. Thousands of people taking part in the biggest food fight in Italy. The battles, oranges date back to nearly a thousand years, representing a revolt by the commoners in Ivrea, who would rise up against the evil tyrannical duke's armies. The town is festooned with banners, pennants and plenty of OJ. The oranges are said to be unsuitable for commercial purposes, so the citrus slingers hurl more than 4 million oranges during the three days of celebration leading up to lent. All right. Shout out time now. It's going out to Tolland High School in Tolland, Connecticut, today. Rise up. And thanks to all who made #yourwordwednesday submission, like Leta DeRays (ph) from Central High in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Today's word, festoon. If you heard it, it means to adorn a place with decorations. Before we go, one more thing: one of the greatest characteristics we can possess as we chase our goals is not ability, it's adaptability. The top achievers in this world don't have all the answers in the beginning nor do they have all the tools they need to succeed. Our goals they may seem unattainable at times, and we will fail as we chase them. But if we keep pushing and become like a chameleon and keep adapting, good things will happen. See you tomorrow, lovely people. I'm Coy and we are CNN 10. END230224

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, lovely people? The weekend is upon us. It is Friday and Friday's rock. We are fueled up and ready to rock it out with you. This the best minutes in news, so let's go, We start with continuing coverage on the intense weather systems sweeping across the United States there's a strong chance that many of you watching right now have already seen your neighborhood impacted. More than 65 million people across 29 states from as far west as California to as far east as Maine were under winter weather alerts, warning of heavy snow, severe icing, extreme cold. Eight hundred and fifty thousand people went without power, more than 1,700 flights were canceled. But we are seeing two extremes across the country right now while a powerful storm is setting record low temperatures across the northern plains, at the same time, there is a heat wave in the southeast setting record high temperatures for the month of February. Can you believe that there is a difference of more than degrees between some places right here in the United States. More now from Brian Todd, a CNN correspondent based in the network's Washington bureau who tells us of the dangers that this storm is bringing to people all across the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In Wyoming, a state trooper has to scramble out of the way as a runaway truck almost hits him. Dangerous conditions on a snowy road in Truckee, California, caused this car to flip. In Flagstaff, Arizona, the snow was so violent that this man told CNN it literally knocked him backward as he and his dog struggled to see and keep their footing. A sweeping massive storm system is pummeling much of the country from California to Maine. More than 65 million people under winter weather alerts across the West, Midwest, and Northeast. The Minneapolis/St. Paul area could get around 20 inches by the time it's over. It could be the most snow that area has seen in three decades. Minnesota's governor discussed the dangers they prepared for. GOV. TIM WALZ (D), MINNESOTA:  The goal is to not to have to pull somebody off the interstate, but we're prepared to do so if that happens. The goal is to make sure that we're ready if there's power losses, being able to keep the highways and move emergency vehicles as quickly as we can. TODD:  Conditions so severe in Minnesota that ambulances have to be specially equipped. RYAN MAYFIELD, HENNEPIN HEALTHCARE EMS ASSISTANT CHIEF:  We have shovels in our ambulances. We have salt and sand mixtures as well to help us out. We have a few sleds if we need to use them. TODD:  California getting hit with snow in places that don't often experience it. DANIEL SWAIN, CLIMATE SCIENTIST, UCLA:  We are going to see low snow all the way from the Oregon border to the Mexican border. TODD:  North of Los Angeles, a long stretch of vehicles is stopped on state route 58 as the highway patrol warns motorists. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are asking everybody to avoid the area, make alternate plans, drive a different day. TODD:  But in different areas, different impacts. Near San Jose, high winds snap trees, brought down power lines, and caused widespread power outages. DIANE CHERMAK, SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA, RESIDENT:  These old Victorians, the wood is so old, if there's a spark that that's what really worries me. TODD:  High winds caused so-called brownout conditions and several vehicle accidents in the Texas panhandle. And with this massive system thousands of flights have been canceled according to the flight tracking site Flight Aware. It says the airports in Minneapolis-St. Paul Detroit and Denver are getting hit hardest. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: A group of penguins in the water is referred to as which of the following? Huddle, colony, water or raft? Wouldn't you know it, all of these are named for a collective of penguins, but a raft refers to a group of penguins in the water. Up next, we're taking a trip to see some penguins in need of some help. Now, first of all I thought all penguins lived in cold snowy regions but that's not true. In fact, there are penguins that can be found waddling around the warm dry shores in South Africa with not a major snowbank in sight. We learn something new every day on the show. This particular penguin population though is dwindling in large part because they're having trouble making their nests. So, humans are stepping in to build them some sweet new digs. CNN went to check in on the tuxedo birds and we'll go there now to learn some more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  Antarctica is known to have the largest population of penguins in the world, but not all penguins live in snow and ice. Some can be found waddling along the balmy shores of southern Africa, on barren and windswept islands like this one. But in the last century, populations of the endangered African penguin have plummeted, due in part to human disturbance, egg poaching and climate change. TRUDI MALAN, CONSERVATION MANAGER, DYER ISLAND CONSERVATION TRUST:  Dyer Island in the 1970s, there was about breeding pairs. At the moment, we're counting breeding pairs. It's quite a severe collapse. REPORTER:  Historically, African penguins made nests in boroughs of guano, layers of accumulated seabird and bad feces. But in the 19th century, humans began to exploit guano supplies and sell it as fertilizer, leaving penguins and their eggs exposed to predators and a scorching sun. KEVIN GRAHAM, ASSOCIATE CURATOR, DALLAS ZOO/AZA SAFE:  At one point in the colonies, it ranged from three to 10 meters in depth and even deeper in some areas. Right now, the deepest guano remaining in any of the colony's measures in the centimeters, the only thing left is bare gravel, bare oil, nothing that they can burrow into and that took away their entire nesting ability. REPORTER:  In 2016, the African Penguin Nest Project dived to the rescue, a coordinated effort between Dyer Island Conservation Trust, Dallas Zoo and other organizations. Its mission is to design and deploy artificial nests that give penguin parents a safe and cool place to raise their chicks. After two years of development and studying old guano nests, project experts settled on a final design which they started deploying in late 2018. The aim was to emulate mother nature as closely as possible. GRAHAM:  We made the entrance hall small so that the penguins can squeeze in and as soon as they turn around, they can protect that entrance hole from any predator it looks a little bit strange when you look at it but it's an exact copy of what the penguins build themselves if they were given the opportunity. REPORTER:  Each nest is fitted with a sensor that measures temperature and humidity which enables researchers to track the nest's microclimate. GRAHAM:  Eggs are an extremely delicate structure. They're only set to be incubated at about 38 to 39 degrees. Any higher than that, and there's a very real risk of the eggs dying. We're going to constantly be looking at the performance of the nests when it comes to the usage rates, are the penguins using them? Are the eggs hatching? Are the chicks fledging? But so far, what we're seeing is that the artificial nests are fledging chicks at a much higher rate than any other option that they have. REPORTER:  Funded by donations or by people sponsoring individual nests, Graham says the project is so far installed more than 1,500 nests around South Africa's penguin colonies. Next year, the project hopes to expand to penguin colonies in Namibia. The end goal is that every penguin that needs a nest will get one. MALAN:  I think we have got a responsibility as humans because you know we've kind of intruded onto a place and messed things up a little bit, but we also can fix it. I never think of an African penguin as cute and cuddly. I think of an African penguin as absolutely tenacious. I think there are such survivors and they should be an example to all of us that you can overcome. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10, a pup with a celebrity smile. Check out this crooked grin canine. Its name, Paul Ruff, named after actor Paul Rudd. It's his doggy doppelganger. Ruff was a shelter dog in Tennessee, but the good news is he found a forever home after he went viral when people pointed out that he had a celebrity twin. All right.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, sunshine? Welcome back. Hope you had a wonderful weekend. I'm Coy Wire, here with you so we can fuel our minds, dominate this week and have a little bit of fun while doing it.  Our lead story on CNN 10 today, the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Friday marked one year since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a large-  scale attack of neighboring Ukraine. It's been a full year of destruction and loss of life. It's been a time where Ukraine has fought back and its allies have come forward to penalize Russia with sanctions on their economy while sending millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has received international praise for his wartime leadership but he has also been criticized. For one, he didn't warn Ukrainian citizens of the impending invasion ahead of time. Why? He says the decision prevented financial panic and that it better preserved Ukraine's economy in order to fund the fight against Russia.  So when might this war end? At a ceremony on Friday, which remembered a somber in anniversary of events that are changing lives forever, Zelenskyy vowed to push for a Ukrainian victory in 2023.  The day was full of commemorations, reflections and tears. But Zelenskyy's tone remained strong and he spoke of the country's resilience during Europe's largest and deadliest war since World War II. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT:  Slava Ukraini. BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  His exchanges with Ukrainian soldiers today were vintage Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy told his army they would be the ones to decide whether Ukraine will exist in the future or not. But one year after Russia's invasion, few doubt that Ukraine's fate hinges in no small part on the man who emerge as an effective war time leader. JOHN HERBST, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE:  The man has a spine. And obviously when you are truly David fighting Goliath, if you don't have a spine, you lose. WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE:  Twelve months later he is the hard bitten leader. I mean, he has been through a year of trial like no other leader. TODD:  And from the first moments of the war it seemed like Zelenskyy was up to the challenge, like when he posted a video message on Facebook from the streets of Kyiv with his cabinet on the second night of the invasion. ZELENSKYY (through translator):  The president is here. We are all here. Our military is here. TODD:  Volodymyr Zelenskyy has since dominated the narrative, from a stirring appearance before joint session of the U.S. Congress. ZELENSKYY:  Ukraine is alive and kicking. TODD:  To what he said to the British House of Commons. ZELENSKYY:  We will not give up and we will not lose. We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, on the streets. TODD:  Compare that to what Winston Churchill said after the evacuation of Dunkirk. WINSTON CHURCHILL, FORMER BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  We shall fight in the fields and in the streets. We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender. BORIS JOHNSON, FORMER BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  He has successfully mimicked Winston Churchill himself. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has mobilized the United States of America. TODD:  Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor remembers Zelenskyy in the early months of his presidency as a good natured, somewhat naive politician. How has the war changed Zelenskyy? TAYLOR:  He's less jovial. He's less -- he's more focused. He's more determined. He's more somber. I mean, this is a hard -- a hard time to go through and he's had it all on his shoulders. TODD:  Still, no one's been able to keep Volodymyr Zelenskyy from the front lines in places like Kherson and Bucha compare that to Vladimir Putin's isolation in the Kremlin. KEITH DARDEN, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY:  He appears fearful. I mean, you get the sense that of a man alone, whereas, Zelenskyy is among his people, among his team and in the fight. (END VIDEOTAPE) TODD (on camera):  The analysts we spoke to say that unless Volodymyr Zelenskyy makes some colossal and unforeseen mistakes, his legacy will likely be very impressive. If Ukraine wins the war, he'll go down as one of the greatest leaders of the century if Ukraine loses he's remembered as a tragic hero. WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Which of these nations is the most populated nation on the African continent? Ethiopia, Nigeria, Egypt or South Africa? Nigeria with around 220 million people is the most populated country in Africa. And up next, we're headed to Nigeria, the country is Africa's largest democracy and its people are voting to elect their next president and vice president. The election comes at a time when two-thirds of the population are living in poverty and almost half of the young people are unemployed the value of the currency there is low while inflation is high and violence and terrorism have reshaped everyday life across the nation. We'll hear now from CNN international correspondent Larry Madowo as Nigerians are making their voices heard in one of the country's most competitive and unpredictable elections in quite some time. (BEGN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it was now close nationwide in Nigeria's tightest election ever, and what happens now is the slow painstaking process of counting the vote. What do you have back there is they hold up a ballot one by one, everybody watching has to agree that that's the person that they voted for and so that will take a while -- which is why we can't predict exactly when the results will be known.  The independent National Electoral Commission says they will do it speedily it might be a couple of days until we know. There were a few reported instances of violence and parts of Lagos and other parts of the country. But these are isolated. It's not a pattern that we can see at least apparently.  There were also at least polling stations where voting didn't take place because of insecurity and security has been a major issue for voters in this election. But the election is taking part in the backdrop of a major fuel and cash shortage. It's led to some chaotic scenes at gas stations and at banks and now whoever becomes an expression of Nigeria has to deal with an economy on the verge of crumbling there are people running, but only three men have a realistic chance of becoming the next president of Africa's most populous nation.  During election is a massive logistical nightmare. Ninety-three million registered voters is more than the next 14 West African nations combined. So it's sort of like organizing election for an entire subcontinent in just one day, and that's why at this location for instance, two of the polling stations there were no votes happening and they don't understand why but people we spoke to told us that we wait for as long as it takes because they want to make a statement in this election. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, sports fans. Take me out to the ball game. Just don't make me stay all day. New rules in Major League Baseball aimed at speeding up the game or taking spring training by storm. MLB is implementing a pitch clock, sort of like a shot clock in basketball. Pitchers and batters, they can't take their good old time anymore, just 15 seconds between pitches with empty bases, 20 seconds when there are runners on base. If pitchers don't get the pitch off in time, it counts as a ball for the batter.  But the rule also states that if the batter isn't ready by eight seconds left well like the Padres Manny Machado found out, they're going to get a strike called against him. Well, with this new rule, we're seeing spring training games finishing around to minutes faster than last year's average of three hours and three minutes. We've seen some games that finished an hour faster.  Now some other big rule changes this season, pitchers can only attempt two pick-off throws per at bat. The size of the bases is increasing from 15 square inches to 18, and defenses can no longer shift their infielders. Players have about a month to retrain their brains before the season opening day is March 30th. For today's story getting a 10 out of 10, a two-month-old baby that already weighs 50 pounds meet Petunia, a two-month-old baby hippopotamus at the Metro Richmond Zoo in Virginia. And not just any hippo, Petunia and her mama Iris are pygmy hippos and there are fewer than mature pygmy hippos remaining in the world. So with each step and with each splash in the pool, Petunia is keeping hope for these hippos alive. All right. Time's almost up for today but for all my go-getters out there, one more thing. Remember complacency is the constant enemy so outwork everyone every single day. Shout out to West Lauderdale High school in Collinsville, Mississippi. Go Knights!  We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10. END230228

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey there, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. We have a special edition of CNN 10 today. We'll end with our typical 10 out of 10 story, but we're going to start with a feature piece on the future, specifically of travel. Planes, trains and automobiles those are typically the modes of transportation we think about when we travel today, but some folks are reimagining a future where the new modes of transportation are so efficient and so fast. It could break the speed of sound. That would make the entire world more accessible. Instead of going to a friend's house across town for dinner, someday we might be talking about zipping over to a friend's house across an ocean. One of the potential new forms of travel in CNN's "The Next Frontier": kind of reminds me of a scene from that blockbuster movie "Elf". (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Through the sea of swirly, twirly gum drops. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  That's right. Being shot through a tube super-fast. CNN business correspondent Rahel Solomon has more about "The Next Frontier". (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Whether through the air, along the track or on the road, modern day transportation has transformed the way we travel on a global scale, allowing mobility like never before. But as growing populations and densely packed cities stress these systems, innovators around the world are imaginating faster more sustainable ways to get from A to B. From supersonic planes to hyperloop pods, what may seem like a pipe dream today could be the future of transit as early as three decades from now. To envision the future of travel, you should first look to the past. To a city that heralded modern day transportation, innovation. ALISYN MALEK, MANAGING DIRECTOR, NEWLAB DETROIT:  Detroit is the Motor City it's known the world over. We put the world on wheels. It was here that Henry Ford pioneered the production lines that allowed us to more quickly produce vehicles in a way that improved quality and allowed more people to be able to afford cars. I'm Alisyn Malek and I'm the managing director of Newlab Detroit. I'm working to help bring a better, more prosperous vision of mobility for everyone around the world. When I think about urban mobility, some of the key pillars that are really critical for that to be successful are accessibility, how easy are the mobility solutions to get to how frequent are the services running, what areas are covered. As we look towards 2050, we're going to be getting up close to 9 billion people. From a transportation perspective, it's really about options and making sure that everybody has at least two if not more of how they can get around. A lot of the systems that we're using were great. They are still great, but we actually need to think about what other solutions can we put out that are useful and also create a great user experience. SOLOMON:  One solution that's certainly gotten a lot of hype over the last decade is the hyperloop. The proposed train in a tube is looking to upend the way we travel, with speeds up to a thousand kilometers per hour it could zoom across an entire continent and just a few hours. Netherlands-based Hardt Hyperloop is aiming to bring this high-speed technology to life. MARS GEUZE, CO-FOUNDER, HARDT HYPERLOOP:  Our vision is to create a world where distance doesn't matter, where it's possible for you to be much more free in where you live, work and how you travel, to really shrink the world for people to live in. To me, the next frontier is to realize sustainable, high-speed and convenient transport of passengers and goods. SOLOMON:  This future forward concept is actually built on the backbone of a 19th century idea where compressed air propelled rail cars through a network of pipes. Today, hyperloop technology is based on two key mechanisms, removing aerodynamic drag through vacuum-like tubes and removing friction through magnetic levitation or maglev, which makes the pods float and move forward. Together, these systems allow hyperloop to achieve ultra-fast speeds. GEUZE:  Now, we're in the first integrated test track that we've built. We've tested a 4,000 kilo or 8,000 pounds vehicle to really show the normal loads that you would have on a tube and that you can still have your levitation system carry that weight. MALEK:  Hyperloop as a technology is very interesting. It does work. You're cutting down on things like drag and friction. High level from a basic physics perspective, that's really interesting. SOLOMON:  And according to Geuze, those properties of physics are what make hyperloop better for the environment. GEUZE:  In a hyperloop, because you remove the aerodynamic resistance, you reduce the energy consumption and therefore you become a much more sustainable solution. SOLOMON:  Companies across the globe are racing to make their own hyperloop, but Geuze says it's more collaborative than competitive with a collective goal to make the world more connected. GEUZE:  There's already a lot of work being done on setting up a regulatory framework to ensure that we finally converge to a single interoperable hyperloop network. SOLOMON:  Seven pioneering hyperloop companies have announced they are joining forces to launch the first global hyperloop association. It includes companies like Transpod, Hyperloop One and Zeleros. This newly formed pact aims to help grow this emerging transportation market as well as work with government and regulatory agencies on policy making. As we look to the future for hyperloop, Malek says the technology is there it'll come down to how it performs against current options. MALEK:  How does the capability of hyperloop match up against competitive technologies, and does it have a reason to win? We're still seeing really great performance out of technologies like maglev trains, which are being used in Asia quite a bit already. GEUZE:  I think is realistic that in 2015, you could have a global hyperloop network up and running. What motivates me the most is that if we can get this done, it will have a massive impact in bringing sustainability to our mobility patterns. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. Continuing with our news on travel, we'll take a look at the original form of travel and that's by foot. And sometimes when you travel, you want to travel in style. Well, what say you about these kicks that took New York fashion week by storm? The aptly named Big Red Boot make you look like you walked right out of a Super Mario game. Would you rock 'em? I don't know if I would. CNN's Jeanne Moos has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  These boots are made for flaunting fashion influencers are styling them. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's a goofy shoe. I give them a 10 out of 10. MOOS:  Even influencers of the grandpa generation. Wrestler Seth Rollins pretends stomped his opponent wearing big red boots. Ever since they went on sale for 350 bucks and sold out in minutes, fashionistas can't shut up about the Big Red Boots created by the art collective MSCHF. They do make you want to touch them. STEVE NATTO, TIKTOK/@STEVENATTO24:  Yeah, yeah. MOOS:  YouTube sneakerhead Steve Natto found that out when he wore them to sneaker con. NATTO:  And some people asked to touch the shoot. MOOS:  How do they feel? Well, the top part -- NATTO:  Its flexible but the bottom part is definitely not. MOOS:  Steve says they're comfy. He wore them all day without pain. Their creator describes them as cartoonish. Some refer to them as Astro Boy boots. And though they're easy to put on, getting them off can get you stuck if you're not wearing your perfect size. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My foot got stuck so I had to do -- I have to do what I had to do, man. MOOS:  Now they're showing up on everyone from puss in big red boots to the character boots from Dora the Explorer to Tony Soprano paired with a bathrobe. People wanted to buy them right off Steve's feet offering -- NATTO:  I got like 800, 900, a thousand. I think I got like 1,300 or 1,400. They just kind of kept going up. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. All you boot-tiful people, thanks for spending part of your day with us. Today is February 28th, National Pancake Day. So happy stacking if that's your speeding and try them with peanut butter if you're feeling frisky. Shout out to Schroeder Middle School today in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Go Raiders!

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Wonderful Wednesday to you. I know we're just halfway through the week but we're going to keep grinding and shining because that's just what we do. I'm Coy. This is CNN 10, and we've got a rendezvous with the news. We're going to start with news on a vegetable shortage in the United Kingdom. Certain fruits and veggies are having to be rationed at most major supermarkets and four of the biggest supermarkets in the United Kingdom say they're putting purchase limits on some staple items like tomatoes peppers and cucumbers. Experts say this could go on for months. Some farmers are saying that they're not harvesting any tomatoes, peppers or eggplants when they usually do at this time of year. A number of factors like bad weather conditions in Spain and Morocco, high energy costs over the winter and even the impact of Brexit and the labor shortages are causing the lack of production. Here's CNN anchor and correspondent Isa Soares in London who's been speaking with local shoppers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Row upon row of empty baskets, empty shelves. A supply gap in fruit and veg has hit UK supermarkets, the shortages affecting shoppers nationwide. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I went for lunch, and I couldn't find it like tomatoes cucumber or lettuce. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It was quite annoying when you weren't trying to get your private day in, and you can't actually get it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The fruits I want to they're gone, nothing there. SOARES:  To deal with the shortages, major British supermarkets are imposing limits on items like tomatoes cucumbers and peppers. The UK's minister for the environment food and rural affairs said a disruption should only last a few weeks, and meanwhile encouraged people to eat more seasonally. Let them eat turnips, she said. THERESE COFFEY, UK MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT:  I'm conscious that consumers want a year-round choice and that is what our supermarkets and food and growers' food producers and growers around the world try to satisfy. SOARES:  Supermarkets are blaming the recent shortages on poor weather conditions in key growing regions. Britain produces a fraction of the food it consumes, relying instead on overseas imports. And key supplies in southern Europe and North Africa, in particular Spain and Morocco, have seen harvests hit by extreme weather conditions. But while climate change plays a significant role in warmer than average temperatures, the government faces another inconvenient truth -- Brexit, the cause of widespread supply chain disruption. LIZ WEBSTER, CHAIR OF SAVE BRITISH FARMING:  Because of the interruption with trade and Europe who kind of underpin our food supply, it means that there's less food coming in from Europe. We're producing less food. So basically, our food security is in real trouble. SOARES:  Labor shortages due to a lack of migrant workers and soaring energy prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine have pushed the gap even wider as farmers struggle with front-end costs. And those costs are passed on to the consumer. Consumers already grappling with record high grocery prices and the worst cost of living crisis in decades. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Where would you find the world's oldest airport? Paris, France; Hamburg, Germany; Maryland, USA; or North Carolina, USA? Flights began at Maryland's College Park Airport in 1909 when Wilbur Wright trained two military pilots. And up next, we're continuing with part two of our feature from yesterday on the future of travel. New technology in the years to come will likely change travel as we know it forever. The planes, trains and automobiles we use today may someday be as antiquated as the horse and buggy. Thought leaders in the travel industry are formulating plans that might make travel faster, cheaper and safer. From hyperloops to air taxis to supersonic jets, here's CNN's Rahel Solomon with more on "The Next Frontier". (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  From highways to railways, flight paths to bike lanes, we have plenty of mobility options on the ground and in the air. But could the next frontier in transit take place over water? One sea-bearing startup is looking to turn coastlines into corridors. BILLY THALHEIMER, CEO, REGENT:  Water transportation is super important because 40 percent of the world lives within coastal communities. I'm Billy Thalheimer, co-founder and CEO at Regent. MIKE KLINKER, CTO, REGENT:  I'm Mike Klinker, one of the co-founders and CTO at Regent. THALHEIMER:  The next frontier is better transportation and when I say better, I mean efficient and sustainable. It's faster, it's easy and affordable and accessible. SOLOMON:  Rhode Island-based company Regent is aiming to enhance the way we travel between seaboard cities and islands with a new mode of transportation, the sea glider. KLINKER:  The sea glider is really a mix between a boat and airplane. You took the two, smashed them together. THALHEIMER:  They combined the affordability and accessibility and convenience of a boat, of ferry transportation with the high speed and long ranges of an aircraft. SOLOMON:  The all-electric maritime vehicle is designed to float, foil and fly along dock-to-dock routes. KLINKER:  The sea glider has three modes of operation. It can be floating so like a normal boat would, floating on the surface of the water, driving around in the inner harbor areas. It has a hydrofoiling mode where you're up above the surface of water on these still so the passengers and the vehicle are insulated with any waves. The last mode is the fly mode. SOLOMON:  The sea glider takes advantage of a few water and air efficiencies to operate. Underwater wings called hydrofoils help lift the sea glider, reduce drag and allow for a smooth ride above the waves. When it's time to take off, the hydrofoils retract and the sea glider won't fly within a wingspan of the water surface, benefiting from an aerodynamic principle called ground effect to glide along a cushion of air. KLINKER:  The sea gliders were powered by 12 by 100 horsepower electric motors and propellers on the leading edge of the wing. Those are all fueled by battery technologists, the same batteries that go into electric cars today. SOLOMON:  The first sea glider called Viceroy will carry 12 passengers, two crew and service short hauls up to 290 kilometers at speeds just under 300 kilometers per hour. Regent is still in the prototype phase, but Thalheimer says they've already proven that technology works. THALHEIMER:  Regent just hit our two-year anniversary. We built the first sea glider prototype and actually proved that this mode of transportation is possible. This is how we typically test our quarter scale prototype sea glider. So, we're really experimenting with all operations floating, foiling. When you get out of this tight area like this out into the open water, that's when we take off and we become that wing and ground effect that high-speed flying vehicle. SOLOMON:  And inside, they're developing the avionics which will be operated by a captain. KLINKER:  There's really two ways that you control the sea glider. You have a power lever and a side stick joystick. So, think of it like you can turn left right with the joystick and you can go tell the vehicle to go fast or go slow. It's very intuitive, much like driving a car or driving a boat. SOLOMON:  While Regent seems to be moving along rather quickly, the co- founders say it has an all been smooth sailing. KLINKER:  One of the biggest challenges for building a sea glider is that we are really pushing physics to the max. So, it's really the combination of all these different really advanced technologies that allows us to do this full mission, but it's really a physics challenge for us. THALHEIMER:  I think the other challenge we had was just the fact that this is so new this has not existed before. So, as we've gone out to customers, there's a lot of education we need to do. You know, what is it? How does it work? How is it crude? How is it certified? SOLOMON:  Thalheimer says they have a $7 billion backlog in pre-orders across the airline and fairy industries. As for next steps, Regent is currently building a full-scale prototype and has ambitions for passenger test flights by the end of 2024, and by 2050, they hope to have large capacity sea gliders in operation with ranges up to 800 kilometers. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's story getting a 10 out of 10, sticking with our aviation theme, a record-breaking paper airplane. A team of young Boeing engineers put themselves on the map when they set a new Guinness World Record by folding, then flying a paper airplane that went 290 feet. Holy origami, that star near the length of a football field y'all. It took them minutes to fold the plane just right, making sure to craft it with as much weight as possible, helping them create the greatest amount of momentum after the toss. Speaking of map, dad joke alert, I got an email the other day explaining how to read maps backwards. It was spam. Shout out to Stevens Middle School in Pasco, Washington. We see you. And I'll see all of you tomorrow. I'm Coy Wire and we are CNN 10. END230302

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Happy Friday eve. It's Thursday, March 2nd. I'm Coy Wire and we are so grateful that you're spending part of your day with us right here on CNN 10. Let's start today with the latest reporting on the origins of COVID-19. It's been nearly three years since the pandemic began and we're still trying to figure out answers about how exactly this virus was able to infect so many people and take so many lives.  Reporting this week states that with, quote, low confidence, the U.S. Department of Energy and the director of the FBI endorse a lab leak theory, meaning the virus accidentally escaped from a lab in Wuhan, China. Low confidence according to the office of the director of national intelligence generally means that the information is scant, questionable or very fragmented or that the intelligence community has significant concerns about the sources.  One of the main reasons that there is so much uncertainty about the virus's origins is that China has not been transparent and willing to communicate openly with their knowledge and information.  Now others within the U.S. intelligence community and many scientists maintain however that this virus developed naturally in animals and then started to spread to humans in an outbreak at a market. Republicans in the House of Representatives on a COVID subcommittee are committed to investigating the issue and finding the origin of the virus. Here's CNN chief investigative correspondent Pamela Brown with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAMELA BROWN, CNN CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  More than three years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The theory that the virus originated from a lab in Wuhan, China in the spotlight. The Department of Energy now saying in an updated classified report, that it believes with low confidence that the virus accidentally escaped from a lab, but that theory remains a minority opinion within the U.S. intelligence community. JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  Some elements of the Intelligence Community have reached conclusions on one side, some on the other a number of them have said they just don't have enough information to be sure. BROWN:  Early in the pandemic, many prominent scientists discredited the so-called lab leak theory. One group writing a letter published in The Lancet Medical Journal saying, "We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin."  But other medical professionals have long refused to rule it out. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FORMER FDA COMMISSIONER:  These kinds of lab leaks happen all the time, actually, even here in the United States, we've had mishaps. And in China, the last six known outbreaks of SARS 1 have been out of labs. BROWN:  Even Dr. Anthony Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed it was possible. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, U.S. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLEGERGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES:  It might possibly have been something that Chinese were doing a virus that they isolated in the wild, and we're having it in the lab and then somehow it escaped out. I don't think that happened, but I have an open mind. BROWN:  According to the intelligence community's assessment, first published in 2021, the origins of the virus will remain elusive until China cooperates with global investigations. Why at this point, do you say it's possible maybe even probable that the virus came from a lab and accidentally leaked out? JAMIE METZL, SENIOR FELLOW, ATLANTIC COUNCIL:  The SARS-CoV-2 virus has an ancestral origin and a type of horseshoe bat, that doesn't exist in Wuhan. If this comes from nature, there would have to be some evidence of it coming from nature. Right now, we don't have that evidence. BROWN:  Now, House Republicans are demanding more information from the State Department, FBI and DOE on the origins of COVID-19.  REP. BRAD WENSTRUP (R-OH):  I want to make sure that we are readying ourselves for the next pandemic. If we will and the more we can learn about natural origins and/or possible lab leak, then the better off we're going to be. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: An object traveling at a supersonic speed is traveling faster than -- 200 miles per hour, the speed of light, the speed of sound or the speed of a hedgehog? Here comes the boom, a supersonic object is traveling faster than the speed of sound. Continuing now with our series on the future of travel, we take to the skies where one company says that they'll be able to take passengers in planes that fly twice as fast as commercial planes being used today. And that means getting to where you're going twice as fast.  But here's the thing, you'd have to be willing to break the sound barrier to do so and that means you'd be going so fast that the aircraft would create a sonic boom which according to NASA is as loud as an explosion or thunderclap.  Here's CNN business correspondent Rahel Solomon with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Planes are a ubiquitous mode of transportation today. They've allowed us to link cities, countries and continents like never before. But what if we could fly faster and experience more in a way that's also better for the planet. BLAKE SCHOLL, CEO, BOOM SUPERSONIC:  I believe in a future where more people can go more places more often. I think that life happens in person, that connecting across oceans is incredibly important to our future.  I'm Blake Scholl, founder and CEO at Boom Supersonic.  The last frontier in air travel was more than half a century ago when we went from propeller aircraft into the jet age, and it's been a long time since we had a step forward. I think the next frontier is all about making the planet more accessible, about having flights that are faster, more affordable, more convenient and dramatically more sustainable. SOLOMON:  Just under a decade old, Colorado-based startup Boom is working to bring supersonic travel back to the skies.  SCHOLL:  I started my career as a software engineer, but I've been passionate about aviation since I was a kid. And I never understood as a tech guy why everything in our world was getting faster and better but our flights weren't. SOLOMON:  Commercial supersonic air travel was first realized in the 1970s when Concord took flight. But after just 27 years, the fleet was retired due to a number of issues, including noise, expensive overhead and cost prohibitive tickets.  SCHOLL:  The supersonic airplane fundamentally is about being able to go very efficiently at very high speed.  SOLOMON:  Supersonic means flying faster than the speed of sound.  According to NASA, typical speeds for these aircraft range from about 1,200 kilometers per hour to about 2,400.  These speeds are achievable through powerful engines and a long lean fuselage design. The downside, supersonic travel creates a shock wave or sonic boom that is loud and disruptive over land, which is why it's only intended for long hauls across oceans. SCHOLL:  We're building on a proven foundation and delivering a new capability to passengers. It doesn't require a massive regulatory change or any regulatory change at all. We've now built XB-1 which is history's first independently developed supersonic jet, and it's going to be in the air here in the next few months, to prove that all of this technology actually works.  SOLOMON:  XB-1 is Boom's prototype of what will be their first airliner Overture according to Scholl. It's expected to be capable of going twice as fast as regular aircraft therefore nearly having transit times. Think San Francisco to Tokyo in six hours or New York to Frankfurt and a little over four.  With orders already placed from U.S. carriers American and United, Boom has a sky-high goal to get Overture into service by 2029. SCHOLL:  On board the airplane, expect a large spacious interior and beautiful large windows it's a supersonic airplane actually flies higher you'll be able to see the skies a deeper blue actually see the curvature of the earth. All of that adds up to a machine that can take you across oceans but at roughly the same cost as flying business class today. Ultimately, our goal is to make supersonic flight available to anybody who flies. There are many challenges we still have left to overcome. What we're doing is complex it's safety critical it requires a lot of money. But when I look back to the past, I also see a lot of challenges that we've already overcome. And that gives me encouragement that we will continue to do things that the world says we can't do.  Supersonic flight is about making the planet dramatically more accessible. When that happens, I think we will live in a very different, more peaceful, more harmonious, more collaborative future. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, teamwork makes the dream work for two eagles building. One is in the nest, then another flies in is like, hey, can you help me with this other one's like, what this stick? And it's like, yeah, can you help me put it over there? Sure, no problem. They pick up the branch and mark it over in perfect rhythm. If I give DJ Nader a beat, he can make them dance. Now, keep in mind, these eagles get to get to be about three feet tall so their nests can get to be about six feet wide. That's wider than a queen-  size bed. Well done, my feathery friends. Well, that's about all we have time for today. Thanks to everyone who's reaching out @coywire on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, and thanks to everyone showing love on our CNN YouTube page. Northside High School in Jackson Tennessee, we see you and we are showing love right back at you. Tomorrow's Friday, can't wait. Crush it today and go be awesome. I'm Coy Wire and we are CNN 10.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, lovely people? It's your boy Coy ready to shine bright with you this first Friday of March. Friday's rock. But before we get into the weekend, let's make a strong end to the week. We are fueled up and ready to rock it out with you right here on CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news. We're going to start today with what I call the scroll that squashes your goals, spending too much time on social media. And one social media app TikTok is looking to put a lockdown on all you're looking around on their wildly popular platform. On Wednesday, TikTok announced that users under 18 years of age will have their accounts locked after one hour of screen time on the app each day. In order to continue, users are going to have to enter a password. Now, the company and many experts believe that the feature could improve the digital wellbeing of users by requiring them to actively opt out of a screen time limit. The new initiative will roll out in the coming weeks and it's one of the most aggressive moves yet by a social media company to prevent people from getting caught up in the seemingly endless scrolling that can be really consuming. The move also comes after TikTok, and other social media platform has faced years of scrutiny of their impact on young users. And TikTok specifically is facing mounting pressure from lawmakers, some of whom feel the platform should be banned altogether, due in part to online security concerns. How much time do you spend scrolling each day? We could all probably spend a little less time on social media, while apps like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat can be really powerful tolls to learn, motivate, inspire and connect us with people. Most experts agree that too much screen time can have that effect, especially on young people. More now from CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Everyone knows that screen time probably is a problem for them, whether you're a teenager or an adult. We spent too much time on our phones. And what's amazing is that, you know, look, these phones have not been around that long. So, a lot of people now research and kind of look into how much time are we spending on phones and what can we do about it? Interesting, one piece of data that jumped out at me, the average person will pick up their phone to look at it, just look at it 300-sometimes a day. So, you're just constantly doing this, and breaking that cycle, that initial cycle of, look, I don't even know why I'm picking up my phone, just doing it, I think was a really important thing that came up over and over again. So, Catherine Price who wrote up a book how to break up with your phone, she says ask these three questions every time you pick up your phone. What for? Why now? And what else? What else could I be doing instead? It's just to sort to bring your brain back online for a second so you're not mindlessly starting to look up your phone. I thought that was really interesting, something I've been doing already in my life. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Let's continue now with part four of our series on the future of travel, the next frontier. It's estimated that by the year 2050, the world population could grow from 7.8 billion to nearly 9 billion. Transportation experts are considering how to support the travel needs for that many people. But could the solution for congested cities mean zipping around above the streets? Here's Rahel Solomon with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It's not a plane and it's not a helicopter. But it might just be your aerial ticket to the next frontier of urban transit. This is VoloCity, an all-electric, manned, drone-like aircraft. It looked like something of a sci-fi film, but this high-tech flyer is aiming to take off in the very near future. DIRK HOKE, CEO, VOLOCOPTER:  The next frontier for me is that we will see urban mobility coming to life and we will see vehicles flying, bringing us from A to B, making our life easier and ensuring the smooth end-to-end mobility. My name is Dirk Hoke and I'm the CEO of Volocopter. SOLOMON:  German manufacturer Volocopter has been busy building the flying taxis of the future. HOKE:  I believe in 2050, we will be using mobility air mobility and as a frequent transportation system, as we do today with taxis. SOLOMON:  But Hoke is quick to tell us, they're not trying to disrupt the travel industry. HOKE:  So, it will not be used where you have an already existing tram, or you have a metro. But in any area where you have very high traffic congestions, the VoloCity will add more alternatives and options to your daily journey. SOLOMON:  VoloCity is designed for single passenger intercity transit with define roots, like from the airport to a hub in a city center. The aircraft is classified as eVTOL, or electric vertical take-off and landing. HOKE:  EVTOL means that we use electric motors to lift the vehicle and then to move forward. SOLOMON:  They are pilot controlled, fly at low altitudes and operate like drones. HOKE:  We chose a multicopter design. That means we have 18 motors and rotors, which enables us to fly very stable and fast and safe. SOLOMON:  VoloCity's current range is 35 kilometers and can reach speeds up to 110 kilometers per hour and it's all powered by nine swappable battery packs. HOKE:  We want to be adding a new mobility without adding to the congestion and to the emissions of this world. With that, we decided from the beginning to fly fully electric. SOLOMON:  Beyond last kilometer transit, Volocopter has plans for a larger integrated portfolio, from the booking platform to the landing platform. HOKE:  We also a designed a Volo Region which will be a five-seater connecting regions and cities up to a distance of 200 kilometers. We have also the Volodrone which is intended to carry cargo up to 200 kilo, and this is all managed by our software platform which we call VoloIQ, which is enabling not only to operate these vehicles, but also to maintain the vehicles and, of course, do also the booking and the security check at the Voloport. Voloports are designed to optimize the charging and the handling of the passenger. We are now leaving the prototype status. We're really on a very solid track to go into commercial operation in 2024, in cities like Paris and Rome, because we believe if we can fly in Paris and Rome, we can fly almost anywhere, because it's a very complex, very dense urban environment. SOLOMON:  Volocopter's ultimate goal is autonomous flight. But for now, there are more steps just to get their fleet off the ground. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  There's still the management of airspace, what are the paths, how do we manage, do we have the regulatory space to allow these things to be adopted? And I think that's where you're going to start to see hopefully soon some pretty interesting conversations taking place. SOLOMON:  And perhaps a bigger hurdle, Hoke says public acceptance. HOKE:  I really hope that people will embrace it, I believe it's a very, very nice vision of the future to have quite sustainable air taxis. And we actually believe we will have a big impact on the transportation of the future. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  For today's story getting a 10 out of 10, an unfrogettable riveting story out of Australia, where a man named Dazza created a 3D printed home for a frog he found hanging out in his fence. He started small, but as his TikTok video of the frog get to rack up more than 20 million views, he got some frogsome ideas from viewers. The little pad has progressed into an amphibious mansion, complete with a porch, plants and the garden and an infinity edge waterfall pool. Oh, viewers named the frog Frederick, and the homebuilder says that Frederick has even some friends come over every now and then to visit. Unfrogettable. All right. I want to give a special shout-out to Northwood Middle School in Wakarusa, Indiana. What's up, lovely people? I also want to show some love to my friends at West View Middle School who sent me like all kinds of great letters and cards, uplifting, motivating messages and they also sent me this pretty sweet t-shirt right here. Tighten up, everybody. All right. Let's keep shining. We're CNN 10 on YouTube. Send your shout-out request there. Have an awesome weekend. And remember, you are more powerful than you know. I'm Coy Wire. It's been a blessing to spend this week with you. END230306

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone, it's your boy, Coy. I hope you had a wonderful weekend. I am excited and so grateful to be right here with you today so we can give each other some good vibes. Let's dig in and dig deep if we have to, to start this week strong. Speaking of deep, way beneath the surface of one of the great lakes, researchers discovered a ship that had been missing for 128 years. Officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA solved the mystery in conjunction with the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The Ironton, a 191-foot wooden schooner barge, sank after colliding with another ship in Michigan's Lake Huron in 1894. The other crew survived, but five of the seven crew members of the Ironton did not. The ship was actually first noticed with cutting edge technology back in 2019, and it is in remarkable condition, standing upright with all three masts still intact, thanks in large part to the cold, fresh water of Lake Huron. Officials kept the discovery a secret until all documentation of the wreck was complete. That way, no divers could potentially disturb this piece of history. But now there may soon be federal and state permits allowing divers to go explore what lies deep beneath the surface.  Up next, we have an update on one of our CNN heroes. Every year, our CNN Heroes event honors individuals who create positive change and make extraordinary contributions to humanity. One CNN hero, Teresa Gray, is a nurse from Alaska who takes small teams of volunteer medics to humanitarian crises all around the world through her nonprofit Mobile Medics.  Well, two days after she heard about the tragic 7.8 magnitude earthquake which impacted Turkey and parts of Syria, Teresa was on a plane on her way to Turkey to help. Here's a feature on how Teresa's work in Turkey is helping people recover from a disaster that took the lives of more than 40,000 people in the region. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TERESA GRAY, TOP 10 CNN HEROES:  Hi, Auri (ph), I came to see your leg. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST (voice-over):  Alaska nurse Teresa Gray and her nonprofit, Mobile Medics International, have responded to dozens of humanitarian disasters since 2017, providing free medical care and comfort to more than 30,000 people around the globe.  Last December, she was recognized as one of the year's top ten CNN Heroes. GRAY:  Being named a CNN hero was amazing. It was like the Oscars of humanitarian work. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Please join me in honoring CNN Hero, Teresa Gray.  GRAY:  It got us exposure internationally. It brought in donations, so now we can go where we're needed, when we're needed. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thousands are dead after a powerful earthquake toppled buildings in Turkey and Syria.  COOPER:  So as the devastating impact of this tragic earthquake became clear, Teresa immediately mobilized to head to Turkey. GRAY:  I need some 100cc Syringes. It's pretty frantic leading up to a mission. We like to get in as soon as possible. So we'll be on the ground about 72 hours post-earthquake. OK, so this bag is ready to go. Making sure we have the right equipment, the right medication. We have enough medications and supplies for hundreds of patients. From a trauma dressing to a Band Aid or a Tylenol to antibiotics.  This mission will be completely self-sustaining. The buildings have been substantially damaged, so you can't stay inside. It's too dangerous. So it's wintertime in Turkey. Yesterday it was 5 below. So we're going to be sleeping in a tent, eating MREs.  This is not going to be a good time. I've got eleven sort of dinners and I've only got two breakfast. I get hyper focus. If I get there and I forgot to pack it. You're not running to the story. You need to make sure that you've got everything you need.  We have to be really careful not to cross the border into Syria. When I put a team together, we need to do a zoom call prior to the mission, so we're all sort of on the same page. My goal is to find where we can do the greatest amount of good for the most people in the time that we have.  We need to find a safe place to be. What if somebody forgot their sleeping bag? We don't speak the language, so I need to find some interpreters. So these are the things that run through my mind as I'm getting ready to go to the airport. There's just a whole lot going on. COOPER:  By February 9, just three days after the earthquake, Teresa had landed in Turkey and connected with her team. They soon headed to Hatay Province, to the town of Samandag. GRAY:  This is beyond destruction. This is apocalyptic. COOPER:  They got right to work. GRAY:  I'm here on the streets of Samandag. We're doing mobile clinics. And all the people are living here in these tents now because the buildings are either fallen down or about to fall down, there is no in between. Everything is damaged beyond repair. So we go street to street to street and we stop at these little tent cities. Here is KT (ph), another one of our translators, who's explaining to the group, how we need to do things.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Currently we've got two lines going. People that have got either chronic or acute problems that will be dealt with. GRAY:  We're seeing earthquake injuries, lacerations. Did something fall on him in the earthquake? Yesterday, we saw a child who had been trapped in the rubble from the knee down for well over 12 hours. We're seeing cough, cold, flus from living together. Whatever it is they need us to look at, we will. But this is what we do every day. Then we go back, sleep in our car, get up the next morning and do it again.  COOPER:  They treated hundreds of people during their mission, and their interpreter, KT, became name an essential part of the team. GRAY:  KT is the one who brought us to this neighborhood and showed us where the need was.  KT (ph):  Every sick people we went, they told me, say them, thank you. It's really good for us because we can't go any doctor. We can't see any doctor. We can't go any hospital. COOPER:  And though KT's family had taken refuge in a greenhouse. GRAY:  So 15 people living? KT: Yes. GRAY:  This is where they're going to live for the foreseeable future. COOPER:  They adopted Teresa's group as their own. This is my new Turkish mama. And these people have taken us in and they've allowed us to stay on their properties. And they've given us tea and coffee. Tell her that we are so grateful for her. COOPER:  Another reminder that even in desperate times. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You're welcome. COOPER:  Humanity can shine through. GRAY:  I know, I'm so sorry. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia. Which of the following birds is NOT the name of a major professional sports team? Pelicans, Penguins, Parrots or Ducks? Between the NFL, NBA, NHL, MLS and MLB, not one team is named the Parrots. Today's story getting the 10 out of 10, a pair of parrots pestering players in the middle of a softball game last week.  And we're talking full on invasion here of a college game between Bradley University and Gardner-Webb. Feathers flying, umpires duck in, and as far as feather or not, they found out where they came from. Well, here's CNN's Jeanne Moos with more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  They took the field, causing a flap. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There are multiple parrots on the field. MOOS:  Two, to be exact. Delighting. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Just gorgeous birds. MOOS:  And freaking out the women's softball players at the University of Central Florida's field, causing an umpire to duck. (Voice-over):  Rain delay, yes. But parrots delay? CHAD STEARS:  That's absolutely the first. MOOS:  Chad Steers was the home plate umpire when one of the parrots made a home on his shoulder. STEARS:  I felt the wind from the wings and a gasp from the crowd.  MOOS:  Let's go to the replay. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One just landed on the umpires. MOOS:  Chad was so unfaith, he pretended to put on his mask as if to resume the game with a parrot on him. When he tried to touch the bird, the parrot retreated to the other shoulder. Who are these mystery birds? MEGAN BROWN: Tiki is the one who eventually got tired and decided to land on the umpire. Megan Brown owns Tiki and Lelu. She was letting them fly free behind the stadium. They always come back. BROWN:  Hi, baby. MOOS:  During our interview, the parrots dislodged her glasses, attacked the lens and pecked it. BROWN:  Hi, Lelu. MOOS:  And perched on Megan's head. She says she's a little surprised Tiki didn't nip the umpire when he touched him.  But Chad loved Tiki. STEARS:  It was just a great moment. MOOS:  After about half a minute, one of the grounds crew lured the bird to him and escorted Tiki out. The umpire's co-workers teased him. STEARS:  Hey, and this is sitting on my desk, you know. MOOS:  Who cares about calling balls and strikes when you're the target of a bird's strike? (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Apparently, that parrot thought it was landing on the shoulder of an "umparrot." Special shout out today going to Camden, New York. Camden Middle School, we see you. Thanks for subscribing and commenting on our CNN 10 YouTube Channel. Some motivation Monday for you.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. Thank you for spending part of your day with us right here on CNN 10, the best 10 minutes in news.  Now we have to start today with some sad and concerning news out of North Korea. Experts say that North Korea's chronic food shortages are growing and so is the number of citizens potentially dying due to starvation. Trade data, satellite images and assessments from the United Nations and South Korea suggest that the nation is grappling with their lowest food supply since the famine of the 1990s, a famine that caused mass starvation, killing hundreds of thousands of people.  Experts say the current food shortage is likely due to complications from the COVID pandemic. Three years of closed borders and strict isolation, as well as floods and storms which offset planting. North Korea is a self- isolated and very secretive country, so it's difficult to assess or prove what's really going on there.  Experts say that equal distribution of any available food there is unlikely because the elite and military are prioritized. Now despite the food shortage which few experts deny, North Korea continues to spend money on missile tests instead of food, and refuses aid from neighboring countries. Here's CNN's Paula Hancocks with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Concerns about North Korea's food crisis are growing. Reports from multiple sources say deaths due to starvation are likely.  LUCAS RENGIFO-KELLER, PETERSON INSTITUTE FOR INT. ECONOMICS:  Probably its worst point since the famine in the 1990s, which killed three to five percent of the population. HANCOCKS:  Attentions are being paid at the very top. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un held a workers party meeting this week, calling for a fundamental change in farming and state economic plans. But many say it is his regime, its chronic mismanagement and isolation that has caused this crisis.  LINA YOON, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH:  We're really talking about three years of no imports of fertilizer. There's been no input of tools or components to fix the outdated machinery that they have. HANCOCKS:  An extensive shutdown of borders due to the COVID pandemic meant almost no food or aid was getting into the country. Only in recent months as minimal trade restarted with China. South Korean officials said last month they believed deaths from starvation are occurring in certain areas, though provided no evidence.  Its rural development agency estimates that the North's food production dropped almost four percent last year from the year before. RENGIFO-KELLER:  Food has dipped below the amount needed to satisfy the minimum human elites. So as it stands by that measure, even if you distributed food perfectly equally which is totally inconceivable, you would have hunger-related deaths. HANCOCKS:  Speaking to South Korea's foreign minister last week, he said Pyongyang has to decide to help its own people. PARK JIN, SOUTH KOREAN FOREIGN MINISTER:  The only way that North Korea can get out of this trouble is to come back to the dialogue table and accept our humanitarian offer to the north and make a better choice for the future. HANCOCKS:  The regime's focus remains on its nuclear and missile program. Seoul's Ministry of Unification says if Pyongyang had used the money spent on launching missiles last year for food, it could have bought one million tons, more than enough to cover the annual food shortage. But that focus is unlikely to shift. YOON:  As the time goes on, the capacity for North Koreans to endure hardship becomes harder and harder, their resilience, you know, runs off and their -- you know, their resources also decrease. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: In biology, a complete set of DNA in an organism is called what? Genome, chromosome, genetic code, or interphase? Genome is the term for the entire set of DNA instructions for a cell or organism. Thanks to recent breakthroughs in genetics, scientists say they will soon be able to bring back prehistoric creatures that have been extinct for thousands of years. We could see a woolly mammoth roaming the earth in as little as four years, according to researchers. Now, woolly mammoths were the huge, hairy-looking elephant type beasts marching through the ice age snow about 10,000 years ago. One company, Colossal Biosciences, says it plans to reincarnate the mammoth using gene editing technology, in a process called de-extinction.  And there are other extinct creatures scientists could bring back as well, like the Tasmanian tiger or the dodo bird. But should they?  As you can imagine, there are plenty of ethical questions about these recent genetic advancements. Here's CNN's Rachel crane with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RACHEL CRANE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Your body contains 37.2 trillion cells and within each is a copy of a code consisting of more than twenty thousand genes and billions of strands of DNA. This code is your genome and it determines everything that makes you you.  What if you could modify that code, bring back extinct species, eliminate hereditary diseases? That is precisely what molecular engineers and geneticists around the world are working on. GEORGE CHURCH, GENETICS PREOFESSOR, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL:  Genes are what we get and we're stuck with them and the environment is the only thing we can change and there's kind of a limit to how much you can do. But now, if we can change our genes, too, but really in much closer to total control of our biology and physiology. CRANE:  George Church is one of many, using a revolutionary gene-editing technique called CRISPR-Cas9, which allows you to modify DNA sequences.  CHURCH:  CRISPR is a way that you can design and target a particular part of your genome and change it to something else, or you can delete a gene. You can make all sorts of edits very precisely. CRANE:  CRISPR is kind of like having the fine delete replace function for DNA. No one actually invented the process. It happens naturally.  Scientists discovered that bacteria alter their DNA to defend against viruses, essentially storing part of a virus so they can identify target and attack the virus if it comes back. Researchers realize the tools bacteria use to do this were Cas proteins, nature's genetic scissors. Geneticists are now using these proteins to make their own targeted changes to DNA. Scientists have been messing with genomes for years. So what's the big deal with CRISPR? CHURCH:  This is dramatically different. I mean, it's like 10,000 times easier. This can be used in agriculture, where you can change any plant or animal, can be used to eliminate invasive species. What's most exciting about CRISPR is our ability to alter long-standing epidemics like malaria and HIV. CRANE:  And that could potentially save millions of lives. CHURCH:  So here we grow human cells, elephant cells. We can do cloning procedures. CRANE:  It turns out that you can make pretty pretties by tweaking small strands of DNA, by making changes to the DNA of the Asian elephant, researchers in Church's lab are working to bring the woolly mammoth back to life. CHURCH:  The difference between a woolly mammoth and Asian elephant is actually quite subtle at the DNA level. CRANE:  What am I going to see a woolly mammoth in Jurassic park? JOE GETSY, RESEARCH FELLOW, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL:  Right. So an actual full woolly mammoth I think is still a few years down the road. We can just change one gene and then the next gene and then soon we have thousands of genes that are changed. The elephant cell will have the exact same DNA sequence as the woolly mammoth cell.  CRANE:  Paint this picture of what the future looks like as a result of CRISPR in your eyes? GETSY:  I suppose the wildest description would be that you have some 150- year-old people that look like their 20-year-old riding on a mammoth. Is that why wild? CRANE:  But CRISPR is not without controversy. If you can make a mammoth, consider what you can do with a person's DNA? For the first time, scientists in China use CRISPER to edit the genomes of human embryos.  People fear CRISPR could lead to designer babies. How do we prevent that from happening? CHURCH:  We shouldn't be playing. We should be engineering and I think that's what we are doing.  CRANE:  Where do you think the moral and ethical boundary is? CHURCH:  Safety. I think safety is number one, just like any new technology or new drug, we should try to make it as safe as possible. If we don't do anything, then people are definitely going to die of malaria next year. A lot of people are going to die of HIV if we don't do something.  If we focus on why it's useful, then that changes the conversation to, you know, what's the alternative? (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's story getting a 10 out of 10, ice cream lovers that'll not be denied their treats, this Dairy Queen in Moorhead, Minnesota, opens every year on March 1st, no matter what the weather is. And if you've ever been to Minnesota in March, it is not warm and toasty.  These faithful fans lining up on opening day, all bundled up, ready to dominate some Dairy Queen blizzards in all sorts of snow. Ice cream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream no matter what the weather. My favorite flavor is Oreo. Well, at least for now. What's yours? I want to give a special shout out to Springdale Middle School in Springdale, Arkansas, rise up. Also for all the students out there, get you some teacher time this Tuesday. Go on and dap up your teacher, give them a handshake or high five, let them know you appreciate them.  See you tomorrow, everyone. I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10. END230308

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. Hope you're off to a great day so far. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, and it's #yourword Wednesday. So, follow me at Coy Wire on Insta, Snapchat, and TikTok, and put your challenge words in the comments section of my most recent post. And we'll try to work one, fun one into tomorrow's show. Now, we start today with the back-to-back winter storms in California's mountain communities that have trapped people in their homes with intense snow for nearly two weeks. Now, the Sierra Nevada region already saw 38 inches over a 24 hour period, and now there's another round of snow headed that way. And many people in the San Bernardino Mountains are getting desperate, unable to leave their homes as their food and medicine supplies are starting to run out. Driveways are blocked. Cars are buried under piles of snow as high as a second story window. But even if they could leave, many businesses, including grocery stores, have been forced to close. Let's hear now from CNN National Correspondent Camila Bernal, who's in California as the state braces for even more snow and people grow even more concerned. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Residents here are still frustrated and so upset just because of how long this entire process is taking. There are people here that have been at their homes for more than 10 days without being able to leave, without access to food, a grocery store, a pharmacy. Here behind me is the only grocery store in town. And the roof collapsed because there was so much snow accumulated at the top of the grocery store that it no longer is open. And so people have to rely on donations. This community is coming together. As you can see here behind me, they brought firewood. And the problem is that I talked to other people who have told me, look, I can't even turn on my fireplace because there is so much snow. So, the ones that can, they are here trying to get anything they can to make their lives a little bit easier. I've talked to people who are stuck higher up in the mountains who tell me look, I cannot even make it to the places where they're giving out these donations. And so that frustration just accumulates day after day after day. Authority is saying they are making progress. They say that so far, they've been able to essentially clear about 85% of the roads in this area. The problem is there's a lot of side streets that are still blocked off because of the snow and many of the residents telling me that that is why they can't leave their homes. They're wanting for this entire process to move a little bit faster. But as of now, authorities are saying that they have to wait. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up Next TikTok could soon be banned in the United States along with other social media apps deemed as security threats by lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats have united and voiced their concerns about foreign owned apps like TikTok. And on Tuesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee unveiled a bipartisan Senate bill that would give President Biden the ability to ban them. Politicians and cybersecurity experts have said that foreign technology coming into America, if not regulated, could be used to spy on Americans or take data from them. Or it could be used as a tool to promote certain ideologies. In other words, it could be used to program our minds. CNN Technology Reporter Brian Fung tells us about the potential impact of this bill. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN FUNG, CNN TECHNOLOGY REPORTER:  This bill could lead to a national ban of TikTok. And it's important to point out here that this legislation is still in its very early stages, but the -- it would give the authority to the Commerce Department to take steps including up to and including a ban of TikTok. The bill doesn't specifically target TikTok, but rather kind of talks about an overall category of technologies that might be deemed to be national security risks, whether that's TikTok or Huawei or other companies that might raise national security concerns. The whole intent behind this bill, according to Senator Warner, is to prevent a so-called whackable situation where the government has to come up with new legal authorities or new bills designed to target individual companies. And this would just give them, you know, a bigger, more flexible tool. TikTok has acknowledged that the trust issue with policymakers is real and that it's going to take time to address that. And it's also said that the ultimate goal is to have U.S. user data only be accessible by TikTok's U.S. employees. Now, TikTok's CEO spoke yesterday at a Harvard Business Review conference, and here's a little bit more of what he said. SHOU ZAPORIZHZHIA CHEW, TIKTOK CEO: I think the first thing I would say is that we take these concerns extremely seriously. The Chinese government has actually never asked us for U.S. user data. And we've said this on the record, that even if we were asked for that, we will not provide that. FUNG: Now, we're seeing here that TikTok CEO is saying, look, it's going to take time to, you know, gain trust with policymakers. We're taking these voluntary steps to improve our security and safeguards. But on the other hand, you have lawmakers like Senator Warner who say, you know, we need action right now. And so, what we're seeing here is this mismatch, this contrast between TikTok on the one hand, you know, saying, let's take some time here, and lawmakers who want to really take some action right this moment. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second Trivia. What TV cartoon premiered in 1962 and featured a futuristic family traveling in flying cars? The Flintstones, The Jeffersons, The Jetsons, or the Brady Bunch? Said to have been set 100 years after its premiere, The Jetsons featured a high-tech family flying in the year 2062. Shows like The Jetsons or movies like Back to the Future make viewers ponder what technology might look like in the future. But here in the year 2023, we're less than 40 years away from that imagined future of The Jetsons.  And at the rate technology advances these days, futuristic worlds actually seem to be just around the corner. So how far away are we from being able to zip up and over traffic jam streets? From being able to hover around a city from rooftop to rooftop? We'll hear from a tech expert who tells us what's holding us back and what such a futuristic city of travel might look like. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY WHITE, TECH WRITER, SPEAKER AND CONSULTANT:  We've been chasing the stream of flying cars since The Jetsons. And Sci-fi has led us to believe that we're going to be having these vehicles, but it's really not the case. eVTOL stands for Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing. It is a vehicle, electrically powered, that can lift off the ground vertically, then go forwards to a certain destination, and then land vertically as well. And there are a number of companies at advanced stages of creating these vehicles, but we're somewhere away yet. There are a number of ways that these eVTOLs could be piloted. Most of the ways at the moment seem to be focusing on having an actual pilot, a human, at the helm. So, they have to be certified. They have to be made legal. They have to obviously have the regulations and how they would fly, where they would fly, who's going to be in charge, who's going to be responsible, whether the vehicles are going to be safe or not. And this is what's holding these vehicles back. It's an interesting question, talking about how eVTOLs will fit into the cityscape, because cities are already very crowded, and so where will you use them? Most people right now are saying they're going to operate as a taxi service. So going from existing heliports and then off to heliport, say, at the airport, so utilizing the existing infrastructure in cities in order to make these things work. So, there you've got some pinch points too, because those infrastructure points are already being used by helicopters and other aircraft. And so you've got to actually fit in with those. You've got to fit in with their flight plans, and also then you've got to work out how to charge them. And no one's got to that point yet. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, we are just over a week away from St. Patrick's Day, so today's 10 out of 10 story is very fitting. A woman from Wisconsin might be the luckiest person in the world, setting the new Guinness World Record for the largest collection of four-leaf clovers. Gabriella Gerhardt started hunting four leaf clovers all the way back in the year 2010. She now has more than 119,000 of them, that's 7000 more than the previous record FYI. Now, learning about this story got me thinking. What's so lucky about this leaf? According to Celtic tradition, four-leaf clovers have magical powers of protection and are able to ward off evil and bad luck. But it's not clear to historians where the idea began. OK, remember to send all those #yourword Wednesday submissions had so many good ones last time. We want to give a special shout out to Laconia Middle School in Laconia, New Hampshire, rise up and thanks for subscribing to our CNN 10 YouTube Channel. Also today, March 8, is International Women's Day. So special shout out to all the inspiring, uplifting and awesome women in our lives. Much love and many blessings. I'm Coy Wire and we are CNN 10.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, hello. It is Thursday, so happy Friday Eve. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. If you're having a good week, keep it going. If you're having a rough week, keep going. Remember, the strongest steel has burned in the hottest coals, and our tough times can make us tougher. Thank you for spending part of your day with us. Let's get you to the news of the day. Thousands of government delegates across China are gathering for the nation's biggest annual political meeting, known as the "Two Sessions." Two parties in China gathering separately for meetings, but at the same time, one is the National People's Congress, which is the supreme state authority for China's communist government. The other is the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which is an advisory group without real legislative power. Thousands of delegates come to Beijing during this period. And traditionally, media, which is usually allowed to attend, gets the rare opportunity to speak with normally elusive government delegates. But even though China lifted its zero COVID policy and media is allowed to attend again this year, delegates weren't very gregarious. In fact, most media were still denied close access to them. CNN International's Selina Wang was there, giving us a rare look at the Two Sessions and showing us just how shut out reporters are, those state medias telling a different story about the access reporters were getting. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Thousands of government delegates across China are gathering for the biggest annual political meeting known as the Two Sessions. It's the first since China abandoned its zero COVID policy. But reporters covering the event are still stuck in a COVID bubble, required to stay overnight at a quarantine hotel and get an onsite PCR test. (On camera):  We just left the Quarantine Hotel. We're now headed to the venue. Everything is highly controlled. (Voice-over):  The foreign media bus gets dropped off at Tiananmen Square. (On camera):  It is very rare for journalists to get access to this. As you can see, though, there's heavy security. There are guards everywhere. Normally, the Two Sessions is the rare chance for media to get up and close to China's top leadership. Right here on the steps of the Great Hall of the People, this is normally where you will see media trying to doorstop the top leadership. But as you can see, this year we, the media, were completely separate from the rest of the leaders. (Voice-over):  The Two Sessions is a carefully choreographed event. The new government shakeups that the rubber stamp parliament will vote on have one unifying goal, to strengthen Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party's Power. And the COVID restrictions are the perfect tool for Beijing to control the message. (On camera):  So, media has to apply to get access to specific events. We're not granted approval to all of them. And this is a media area inside the Great Hall of the People. As you can see, it's pretty empty, so it's clearly not an issue of capacity. (Voice-over):  Some of the events during the weeklong meeting allow select reporter questions, including Qin Gang's first press conference as China's new Foreign Minister. He said that conflict with the U.S. Is inevitable if Washington does not change course. Qin Gang called Washington's approach a reckless gamble, accused the U.S. of creating a crisis over Taiwan, defended China's partnership with Russia as imperative, and said it has not supplied weapons to Russia or Ukraine. Meanwhile, Chinese state media is portraying the legislative meeting as an open event where journalists can freely operate. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Sri Lanka. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm from Luke News (ph). It's an amazing country. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The assemblies also offered journalists the opportunity to put questions to the Chinese premier and ministers. WANG:  But under these controls, spontaneous run-ins with top leaders like the premier and ministers are out of reach. But after today's meeting ended, we had a few minutes to approach some delegates, which are a curated group of local representatives. This delegate is part of the Zhuang ethnic group from the southwestern Guangxi province. She says, this is her first time attending the Congress and she feels happy to see her motherland becoming stronger. The rest of the delegates quickly rush out before we have a chance to approach them. The question is, how much of these COVID controls will remain in post pandemic China? It limits access even more to China's already extremely opaque political machine. This much is clear, the communist leadership only wants the world to see one narrative from China, that is the image of unity, strength and victory. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia. Which of these holds the current title of planet at the most moons? Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, or Venus? To date, astronomers have identified 92 moons orbiting Jupiter, giving it the top spot. And it is one of those moons, specifically that scientists are getting ready to explore more. Why? Because they think that there may be life there. The name of the moon is Europa. And it's already been discovered that just beneath Europa's icy surface there's an ocean. In fact, it was the first ocean ever discovered on another celestial body. Let's learn more about the probes that NASA and the European Space Agency are sending to Jupiter and its moons and what they might find. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Jupiter has three moons with oceans underneath their icy shells. They're called Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa. Earthlings have been curious about these moons and their potential to house life for a long time. NASA first sent probes in part to get a closer look in 1977. Jupiter is a gas giant. That means it doesn't have a surface. It's a swirl of gases that can dense into a smoldering ocean of hydrogen at its core. It's very similar to our sun in this way. But unlike the sun, it doesn't fuse hydrogen atoms into helium to create energy and heat. Now back to those first NASA probes, they observed long lines and dark spots on the moon Europa. Typically, moons have cratered surfaces. But these images tipped scientists off that there might be an ocean beneath Europa's icy exterior. In 1996, that theory was confirmed when the Galileo spacecraft reached Europa. It was the first ocean discovered on another planet. Then, in 2012 and 2016, the Hubble Space Telescope showed water plumes erupting from the warmest parts of Europa. Scientists don't know much about the plumes. But if Europa has water and elements like carbon and hydrogen, it could mean that microbial life once formed there or even still exists. Armed with that possibility, the European Space Agency and NASA are sending probes deep into our solar system to look specifically at Jupiter's icy moons. First is the Jupiter icy moons explorer or JUICE from the ESA. JUICE is traveling to the Jupiter system armed with the latest technology to take photos, observe the magnetic field of Jupiter and take readings of what is beneath the icy crusts of Jupiter's large moons. Later, NASA will send the Europa Clipper to fly by its namesake over 40 times to sniff its atmosphere. It will gather material from the plumes for the first time. And that will give scientists a better idea if Europa's oceans could support life. The missions will gather data. They will also aim to gather insights into fundamental questions about our universe. Is there life beyond Earth? What might that look like? And what does that mean for the future of humanity? (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's story, getting a 10 out of 10 Jupiter and one of its planetary pals giving us a constellation prize. Last Wednesday, in a phenomenon known as conjunction, Jupiter and Venus appeared to nearly kiss in the nighttime sky at their closest from a stargazer's perspective, they were just one degree apart. But they weren't actually close. They were still about 400 million miles apart. That's more than four times the distance between us and the sun. Jupiter and Venus are the two brightest celestial bodies in the nighttime sky after the Moon, though, so this was still pretty awesome to see. We are giving a special shoutout to Crook County Middle School in Prineville, Oregon today. We see you. Thanks to everyone who subscribed and commented on our CNN 10 YouTube Channel for a shoutout. I also want to show some love to @Mr.Gio Meany (ph), who won the #Your Word Wednesday submission.  The word I used today was gregarious, an adjective used to describe someone who is sociable.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Happy Monday and welcome back. If you're still waking up, stretching and yawning because daylight savings stole an hour of your sleep, I feel you. But I'm going to jab back at that sleepy voice in my head because somebody has to dominate this day, so why not us?  I'm Coy Wire. Thankful to be here to start this week strong with you right here on CNN 10. Parts of California faced persistent flooding over the weekend after rounds of deadly storms. 34 of California's 58 counties have been under a state of emergency issued by the governor's office due to the storms. And there's still a threat of more severe weather this week. More than 41,000 homes and businesses across the state were without power this weekend, and about 15 million people throughout the state were under flood watches, including parts of northwest Nevada.  Local emergency crews are having to rescue people from their homes. Roads have been washed away. Bridges have collapsed. The impacts from this week's storms have only compounded problems created in some areas by the severe rain and snowfall over the past two weeks.  President Biden approved a state of emergency declaration for California to help aid the millions of residents affected who are being urged to stay clear of waterways and avoid all unnecessary travel.  Here's CNN National Correspondent Nick Watt with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK WATT, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Water, everywhere, causing chaos across central California. Some 25 million are under flood warnings. The Kern River usually runs at about six feet, it's up over 17th. Snow is the issue up at altitude. In SoCal, they're rushing to rebuild some sort of road for 450 households. This is their only way out. Springville's Pleasant Valley Road now anything bad. In my 40 years, never seen it like that, to the man who shot these images. A major artery in Oakland closed at rush hour nearby a peach coffee warehouse roof collapsed, killing one. Around 25 times the volume of water that flows in the Mississippi is flowing through the air and this is the 10th so-called atmospheric river to hit California this winter. Low pressure from the north meets moist air near Hawaii. They call it a Pineapple Express, sounds fun? It's not. Essentially a fire hose aimed at this state usually famed for its sunshine. Throw in a couple of other winter storms that dumped a couple of years' worth of snow on some upland areas. And this is the result. Today's storm is a warm one. So along with all this rain, some of that snow is melting. The residents of Felton flooded in January once more told to evacuate, here and elsewhere yet more upheaval. ALISA, NEWMAN, CALIFORNIA: Now, we have to go home, pack our stuff and leave once again when we were just able to come back a couple of weeks ago. WATT: Good news, all the water this winter is significantly rolling back. The years long drought suffered in the West. Bad news yet another atmospheric river's forecast to hit this state early next week. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia. Which of these European cities is known as the city of light? Madrid, Paris, Rome or London? It's been called the capital of fashion and the city of love, but Paris is also well known as the city of light.  And up next, we're traveling to France where over 1 million people have been protesting against the government's plans to raise the retirement age for most workers in the country from the age of 62 to 64.  The protests have happened in major French cities and the impact has been felt across the country. It's brought many transportation services to a standstill. Trains shut down, flights canceled, old schools and businesses, closed, as trash piles up on streets.  Even the Eiffel Tower was closed to visitors. The French government has said that raising the retirement age is necessary to keep their pension system viable. All French retirees receive a pension from the government on average around $1,500 a month.  But this planned reform angers workers at a time when living costs, food costs and energy bills are rising in France and elsewhere. Many of the protesters are young people, some who haven't even entered the workforce yet, they say, though, that for a generation already concerned about inflation and job prospects, the government moving the finish line on retirement is depressing. We'll hear now from CNN's Jim Bittermann from the streets of Paris. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): French President Emmanuel Macron, like his predecessors, has run into fierce opposition from the streets trying to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Strikes are growing by transportation, energy and even garbage workers.  (On camera): In a country where the average life expectancy has now increased to the age of 82 years old, it seems reasonable to expect that with France's pay as you go retirement system that, in fact, the retirement age would have to increase as well.  After all, as it stands now, if you retire at 62, it means collecting pension benefits for, on average, 20 years. And the money has got to come from somewhere. (Voice-over): But it's not that reasonable to everyone.  TAYEB KHOUIRA, SUD UNION SPOKESPERSON (through translator): We are going on an unlimited renewable strike as long as this reform has not been withdrawn. BITTERMANN: Economists here will explain that while people are not especially happy with the present system, any further meddling with it is viewed with suspicion and anger.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, up next, we are traveling to the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom, where they have some of the rarest animals on the planet. They've welcomed the birth of the endangered Malayan tapir, three of the threatened fossa pups, triplets they had, and the world's rarest chimp, the critically endangered Western chimpanzee. This zoo's mission is to prevent animal extinction through conservation. Let's hear more about this zoo's 10-year plan in the next episode of CNN Series Call to Earth. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The small northern English city of Chester might seem like an unlikely place to find some of the world's most endangered animals. But since the 1930s, Chester Zoo has grown a reputation as one of the best in the world for conservation, with a targeted aim of preventing species extinction.  MARK BRAYSHAW, CURATOR OF MAMMALS, CHESTER ZOO:  There's a huge biodiversity crisis at the moment. I mean, losing species at a phenomenal rate. And some of these species, we're not even aware of them. We don't know their sort of role. And so, you know, by taking species out here, now we don't know the long-term impact on that.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  While the gold standard for Chester Zoo is to breed species to reintroduce to their natural habitat, in many cases now the urgent focus is on creating a safety net population in captivity. BRAYSHAW: Almost into the zoo action as an arc. And we might be in a situation where actually a species habitat is gone. They're not going to go back into their natural habitats. We had to sort of look at other places we could put them back into, balancing up, you know, any sort of impact that might have. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Luckily for the preservation of some of these critically endangered species, the zoo is in the midst of a baby boom. A birth for the world's rarest chimpanzee, triplets for the Madagascar fossa, a greater one-horned rhino, a Malayan tapir, and finally, an addition to the zoos family of Marsupials. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Morning Kitawa (ph). UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Increased mining and deforestation in Papua New Guinea have seen the wild population of Goodfellow's tree-kangaroo more than halved over the past 30 years. So the birth of a new joey in Chester provides a glimmer of hope for the future of the species. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And for today's story, getting a 10 out of 10, the family whose house was mistaken for Spiderman for decades, hundreds of letters have been sent to 20 Ingram Street in Queens, New York, addressed to Peter Parker, aka, spiderman.  The address appeared in a comic book in 1989. And it just so happens that the real-life family who lived there is the Parker family. They thought they were being pranked at first, receiving letters from kids all over the world, telling Spiderman how awesome he is.  Now, these superhero letters are now on display at the City Reliquary Museum in New York City, showing hope, optimism and belief in a better tomorrow. Now, your letters make us feel super. Thanks to the Senior Government class at Cascade High School in Montana, inspiring us to keep working to create a better tomorrow.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, all you lovely, smart people. Welcome to March 14, the birthday of one of the smartest people to ever live, physicist Albert Einstein, born in 1879. And everybody knows that Albert Einstein was a genius. His brother there, Frank, though, was a real monster. Hey, you. I joked to the start your Tuesday off right. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, and we've got a big show today, and we start with the collapse of a bank in the United States over the weekend that has people worried about losing their money and businesses on the verge of going under. Silicon Valley Bank, an epicenter for tech startup companies with $175 billion in deposits at the end of 2022, has collapsed. One reason, those rapidly rising interest rates we've been talking so much about on this show. Well, they made the Treasuries, in which the bank had invested money, less valuable. So, the bank started to sell them at a loss, and that scared people who had money there. So, they went on what's called a bank run, withdrawing all their money in a panic. The more people that did that, the more others wanted to do the same. Inevitably, the bank collapsed. The FDIC, or Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, seized control of the bank, and President Biden said yesterday that all depositors would get their money back. And businesses that kept assets there, well, they would have money to pay their employees. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank had a ripple effect on a second bank. The same sort of bank run hit Signature Bank shortly after it had its doors slammed shut, as regulators warned that keeping it open could threaten the entire financial system's stability. Now, there are fears that other banks may be next. There's a term for this sort of spread of fear over people losing money when banks collapse. It's called contagion. So yesterday morning, President Biden addressed the nation for the first time publicly to try to ease those fears, knowing that the panic could cause a devastating economic fallout for people and businesses around the world. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT: All customers who had to pay deposits in these banks can rest assured, I want to rest assured, they'll be protected, and they'll have access to their money as of today. That includes small businesses across the country that bank there and need to make payroll, pay their bills, and stay open for business. No losses will be -- and this is an important point, no losses will be borne by the taxpayers. Let me repeat that. No losses will be borne by the taxpayers. Instead, the money will come from the fees that banks pay into the deposit insurance fund. Because of the actions of that -- because of the actions that our regulators already taken, every American should feel confident that their deposits will be there if and when they need them. Second, the management of these banks will be fired if the bank is taken over by FDIC; the people running the bank should not work there anymore. Third, investors in the banks will not be protected. They knowingly took a risk, and when the risk didn't pay off, investors lose their money. That's how capitalism works. And fourth, there are important questions of how these banks got into the circumstance in the first place. We must get the full accounting of what happened and why those responsible can be held accountable. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Up next, an update on the intense flooding in California. A levee or a barrier designed to stop the flow of water was breached in California's Pajaro River this week and the river overflowed out of control towards the people and homes nearby. One of the worst levee failures was in New Orleans, Louisiana in 2005. It led to 80% of the flooding in the city during hurricane Katrina. CNN Correspondent Mike Valerio was in Pajero during the evacuations. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIKE VALERIO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Warnings of intense sustained flooding in the days ahead after California's latest atmospheric river compromised part of a critical levee, sending this rushing river into homes, farms and trapping families in the small community of Pajaro. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We really didn't expect it to happen, but here we are now. JOSE PERE, RESIDENT, PAJARO, CALIFORNIA:  They started evacuating, I would think at 12 in the morning or 1 in the morning.  And they just started. The national guards are just taking people out as they go. VALERIO:  Officials say an 11th atmospheric river system, forecast for Monday could send more water rushing through the still breached levee. CAPT. CURTIS RHODES, PIO, CAL FIRE:  There could be more water in our backdrop, but there will also be more water throughout the county. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Coming down. There you go. Just keep this line. VALERIO:  The raging floodwaters leading to a dramatic aerial rescue captured above the Salinas River. California highway patrol saving a man stranded on an island after floodwaters swept him and his car into the river. The man brought to dry land unharmed. SHERIFF TINA NIETO, MONTEREY COUNTY, CA:  Folks, we are not done yet. We are dealing with rain and wind events that I can only describe as a super, super saturation event. VALERIO:  But an undeniable sense of flood fatigue creeping in even as officials issued new evacuation orders for more communities near the Salinas River and back in hard hit Pajero, community supervisor Luis Alejo told us there's a sense of vulnerability both about the future of Pajaro and its mostly migrant families. LUIS ALEJO, COMMUNITY SUPERVISOR:  This community is resilient, it's strong. When these waters received Pajaro is going to rise. This is such a great hardship on this community, but we know that we will get through this. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia. With an atomic number of 11, which of these elements gets its symbol from the Latin word "natrium"? Nickel, Sodium, Sulfur or Nitrogen? If you missed this, don't be salty. With a symbol of Na, sodium is the correct answer here. Now, some creatures, like ocean animals, thrive in salt, but that could just be because pepper water would make them sneeze. Anyways, the World Health Organization is calling for us humans to cut back on the salt. They want salty food consumption to be monitored not only by individuals, but they're also calling on countries to implement policies that would set limits on the amount of salt in foods being served in public places like schools. Now, if you love French fries like me, you may just find this insulting. More now from CNN Health Reporter Jacqueline Howard. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER:  The World Health Organization wants people to cut back on salt. And we know that eating too much salt is one of the top risk factors for heart disease, stroke, and death. And the World Health Organization says that only nine countries have what they're calling a comprehensive package of policies to reduce sodium intake. Those countries are Brazil, Chile, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and Uruguay. And examples of these policies are reformulating foods, so they contain less salt or setting limits on foods high in salt being served at public places like hospitals or schools. And the WHO is now calling on all countries to implement sodium reduction policies. It says doing that could save an estimated 7 million lives globally by 2030. And it's considering extending its 30% target to 2030. And right now, Dr. Francesco Branca with the WHO says people living in high income countries consume a good amount of salt in one snack. DR. FRANCESCO BRANCA, WHO DIR., DEPARTMENT OF NUTRITION FOR HEALTH:  Just to give you an example, if you take an average bag of chips of 150 grams, only that bag of chips contains half of the salt we are supposed to consume every day. HOWARD:  And in the meantime, though, there are steps you can take personally to watch how much salt you eat. The WHO says, to cut back on salty sauces and condiments, avoid snacks that are high in salt. And when using canned or dried products, choose varieties without added salt and sugars. It's recommended to limit your salt intake to less than 5 grams per day. That's just one teaspoon. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  And In today's story, getting a 10 out of 10 is "sawsome." Some artists use a paintbrush, some use a pencil or chisel. But Glenn Richardson uses a chainsaw, baby. Richardson has carved chainsaw portraits of people since 2016. Now he's traveling the country in a yellow bus, making 19 stops along the way, carving people's portrait into wood, and then putting the finishing touches on. Look at that blowtorch. His goal is to hear people's stories and share them with others in hopes of bringing people together. Can you believe it only takes him about 17 minutes to create one of these. He starts on the East Coast in May and believes he can reach the Pacific Coast by October. That's tremendous. Now, don't get all sappy on me, but I'd carve each and every one of you out of wood if I could. But I'm not too experienced with carving. I only know a little. Now, on to my favorite part of the day. I want to give a special shout out to. Byers Middle School in Denver, Colorado. We see you. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10.

Like Mr. Sliz (ph) at Pine Valley Central School in South Dayton, New York, who I met recently. All of you, keep uplifting guiding and inspiring, helping us make sense of this world in which we live.  Students, go on and give your teachers some heart hands today and let them know you appreciate them for being the best that they can be for you. Now, we start today with news from the Black Sea, where a Russian fighter jet forced down a U.S. Air Force drone this week after damaging the propeller. The U.S. drone and two Russian aircraft were flying over the Black Sea when one of the Russian jets intentionally flew in front of and dumped fuel on the unmanned American drone several times. According to U.S. officials, the Russian aircraft then hit the propeller of the drone, prompting U.S. forces to bring the drone down to the water. The incident marks the first time Russian and U.S. military aircraft have come into direct physical contact since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine just over a year ago. And the incident this week is likely to increase tensions between the two nations. The U.S. called Russia's actions reckless, environmentally unsound, and unprofessional. But the Russian Ministry of Defense denies that the Russian jet made contact with the drone at all. This is a potentially dangerous escalation at a critical time in the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine. We'll hear now from CNN Pentagon Correspondent Oren Lieberman, who has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  All of this plays out early Tuesday morning in international airspace over the Black Sea when the U.S. says its MQ-9 Reaper drone was intercepted by two Russian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jets. That part is not that uncommon, and these sorts of intercepts have happened in the past. What is extremely rare is what happened as this played out. Over the course of 30 to 40 minutes. The Russian fighter jets, according to the Pentagon, repeatedly flew around and in front of the U.S. drone, dumped jet fuel in front of it, and even collided with it, damaging the propeller and forcing the U.S. to take down its own drone in international waters in the Black Sea. Now, the National Security Council's Coordinator for Strategic communications, John Kirby, told CNN that the U.S. took steps to protect its equities, but it's unclear exactly what that is, whether that was some sort of self-destruct or some other step to protect it.  Now, the drone has not been recovered, partially because at least there is no U.S. naval asset in the Black Sea to have carried out such a recovery. So the U.S. took some step to protect its own equities. This MQ-9 Reaper drone. But again, unclear what that is. Much of the response so far has been in the diplomatic lane. The U.S. summoning the Russian Ambassador to the U.S. and carrying out at least a 30 minutes conversation at the State Department.  Russia giving an entirely different version of events, saying there was no collision, there was no Russian jets firing at that U.S. drone, but Russia saying it does not want confrontations. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia.  Which of these U.S. states is nicknamed the Gem State? Oregon, Idaho, Arkansas, or Delaware? Idaho. The Gem State is the 14th largest, and it's bordered by Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, Washington and Oregon. We'll travel to Oregon now where some residents are pushing to move the state line so that they can join their neighboring state of Idaho. The movement known as Move Oregon's Border for a Greater Idaho is looking to redraw the border between Oregon and Idaho so that about 20 rural conservative Oregon counties can instead become part of Idaho. These counties say that they want to do this because they want a Republican led government. Oregon's state government is currently controlled by Democrats, while Idaho's state government is controlled by Republicans.  Critics of the idea have called the plan bad for America and have stated that the U.S. political system works best when there's a balance of different viewpoints. But members of the group pushing for change have said rural Oregon is politically outnumbered in its state and that their voices have been ignored for years.  The group believes their livelihoods, industries and freedoms are hurt by the policies of a government that doesn't share their values. Still, those opposed to the idea believe dividing America into politically like-minded people is the opposite of a healthy country.  We'll hear now from CNN National Correspondent Kyung Lah looking at both sides of this debate. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SANDIE GILSON, GREATER IDAHO MOVEMENT:  It's extremely frustrating. The rules and regulations that they're making that make sense in the city don't make sense out here. KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Out here in eastern Oregon, the expansive rural region and Sandie Gilson's home where we're walking is a world away from the urban cities of the state. (On camera):  Do you have anything in common with Portland? GILSON:  Oh, sure, we're all people.  LAH (voice-over):  But she says that's about it. And the signs dotting the east tell you what many people here want known as the Greater Idaho Movement. Redraw the state line so liberal Portland and the other democratic cities are Oregon. And eastern Oregon overwhelmingly Republican joins largely conservative Idaho. Nearly all of Oregon's 17 eastern county governments have approved plans to leave and form a larger Idaho resembling the logo on Sandie Gilson's hat.  (On camera): Is this about politics or differences? GILSON:  Both. We are very different people. I don't believe that the Oregon government as a whole and the supermajority that has been in power there for many decades is listening to eastern Oregon at all.  BARBARA EHARDT, IDAHO STATE HOUSE: It just overwhelmingly hit me this makes sense. LAH:  So much so that Idaho State Representative Barbara Ehardt, a Republican, co-sponsored a bill to begin dialogue with Oregon. EHARDT:  This is where all the big decisions are made for the Idaho legislature. LAH:  The bill passed the Idaho House and is now before the Senate. Idaho's government is officially on a path to redraw its state line for the first time since 1864. EHARDT:  The country is so torn apart right now. LAH:  By ideology? EHARDT:  Yes. LAH:  Is this your vision of peace? EHARDT:  It is one of the solutions, yes. ILANA RUBEL, IDAHO STATE HOUSE:  Are we going to carve Georgia out of Atlanta? Are we going to carve Austin out of Texas? Are we going to slice Michigan's? It's a ridiculous road to start to go down.  LAH:  State Representative Ilana Rubel knows all about being a political minority. She's a Democrat in Ruby Ridge, Idaho and voted against the state bill. (On camera):  Are you surprised that it has already gotten this far?  RUBEL:  I'm saddened, but I'm not surprised. We are in a time, I think, of unprecedented partisanship and hostility. GILSON:  Portland's changed. Salem's changed. Eugene has changed. LAH:  What do you say when the people of those cities say that they're changing with the times and that's the America of today. GILSON:  They say it's more progressive to have government tell you what to do. But the people here haven't changed. LAH:  If these two states do agree to redraw the state lines, then Congress has to get involved and Congress has to approve this entire measure. But how would this work if they do, do all of this? This is Oregon on that side of the river, that is Idaho. Oregon, where I am standing, would become Idaho. Just like 250 miles to my north, to the west and to the south. It would form one of the largest states in the entire country, a new Idaho. Organizers say it would be approximately the size of Montana. (END VIDEOTAPE)  WIRE:  I love shoes. So if you're a sneakerhead like I am, we might be soul mates.  And you're going to love today's story, getting a 10 out of 10, an exorbitant price tag for some shoes. A pair of Air Jordan 13s are expected to shatter auction records with a high estimate of $4 million.  Worn by the legend Michael Jordan himself in the 1998 NBA Finals, the last championship series, by the way, he won with the Chicago Bulls. The current record is another pair of Jordan's game worn shoes which went for 1.47 million 2 years ago.  Open bidding is set to take place online starting April 3. Shulala weh weh. Those are sweet. All right. So many great. Your word Wednesday submissions yesterday on my @coywire social accounts. Thanks to today's winner @Brady E. Ellison (ph) for exorbitant. Did you hear it? It's an adjective meaning unreasonably high when talking about a price or amount charged. Our special shout out today is going to Redwood Collegiate Academy in Ukiah, California. Big love for the third biggest state in America. Do you remember which state is the largest in the country? It was on yesterday's show. I'll ask somebody. See you tomorrow, lovely people.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, lovely people. It's Friday, March 17, St. Patrick's Day. So happy St. Patrick's Day, y'all. The weekend is upon us, and we have had an awesome week. So let's lock in and finish this week strong. We start with a trip to Japan today, where the number of births last year dropped to a record low.  This population decline is a trend for the island nation that experts are worried about. Deaths have outpaced births for more than a decade, so Japan now has a huge elderly population and a shrinking workforce. There's no population to fund pensions and health care as demand from the aging population rises, Japan's Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, warned citizens that the country is on the brink of not being able to maintain social functions.  A government agency was even set up to focus on this issue. One reason for the population loss is Japan's high cost of living. There is also limited space in the cities and a lack of childcare support, which makes it challenging to raise children in Japan.  Let's learn more and head to one rural town where more than half of the village is over the age of 65. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Just after sunrise in the Japanese countryside, no alarm clock needed. The Yokobori family feeds their flock of chickens, feeding themselves freshly laid eggs.  French toast for breakfast, bread baked on a wood burning stove. Wood they chopped from cedar forests surrounding their home. Ten years ago, Miho was an office worker in Tokyo. Today, she's a homemaker. Former graphic designer Hirohito (ph) now a woodworker. The couple runs a small bed and breakfast. For them, city life lost its luster in 2011. A new life in the mountains of Nara Prefecture. Their home miles from the nearest train station. Around here, you need a car to get around. (On camera):  It's so beautiful. But you're so far away from all of the 24/7 convenience of Japanese city life. (Voice-over):  They move to Kawakami Village, a tiny township tucked way on windy roads, the trees taller than most buildings. When the young couple got to know their neighbors, they got quite a shock. (On camera):  Did you guys know before moving out here that the average age was as old as it is? MIHO YOKOBORI, KAWAKAMI VILLAGE RESIDENT:  No. RIPLEY:  You didn't know? (Voice-over):  The mayor tells me more than half the village is over 65.  TADAAKI KURIYAMA, KAWAKAMI VILLAGE MAYOR (through translator):  40 years ago, the population was around 6000. Today it's 1156. RIPLEY (voice-over):  The village population plunging faster than anywhere else in Japan. Some say it's in danger of disappearing for good as people pass away, abandoned homes sit empty. Others sit underwater. Casualties of a dam and reservoir finished a decade ago. (On camera):  When you see the prediction of, you know, under 300 people living here 20 years from now, how do you -- what do you do as mayor to try to stop that from happening?  KURIYAMA:  I'm not optimistic, but I don't think it will be that bad. I believe that people should live in such a nice place. RIPLEY:  The population data is dire, and not just in Kawakami Village. Nearly every local government in Japan predicts a lower population and higher average age by 2045. Entire villages on the verge of extinction. Japanese society is shrinking and aging so fast its future survival is at stake. I'm going to one of the few places in Japan with population growth. You can probably guess where it is. (On camera):  For decades, Japanese young people have been fleeing their small rural towns, lured by the draw of big cities like Tokyo and Osaka, all of them connected by the bullet train. (Voice-over):  But there's no magic bullet for Japan's population problems. Even in Tokyo, the towers are high. Birth rates hit record lows. Japan's population plummeting for more than five years. If the trend continues, experts fear it will fall past the point of no return.  (On camera):  Why are so few women in Japan having children? YUKA OKADA, DOCTOR (through translation):  People usually, for now, don't have the money. RIPLEY:  Is life here in Tokyo too busy for a lot of people to find a partner? OKADA:  Working not in the office, at home, so it's very difficult to meet other people. RIPLEY:  It sounds like there's a lot of lonely people in this big, massive city. OKADA:  Yeah, so -- I think so, too. RIPLEY:  New parents in Japan already get a baby bonus thousands of dollars to cover medical costs.  For singles, a state sponsored dating service powered by artificial intelligence.  So far, boosting Japan's birth rate has been a losing battle. The Yoko Boris (ph) are doing their part. (On camera):  So when he was born, he was the first child in this village in how many years? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  25 years. RIPLEY:  25 years. (On camera):  Also a big challenge raising a child in the mountains, no neighborhood kids to play with. Just six children in his kindergarten class 30 minutes away. The nearest high school more than 2 hours away. MIHO YOKOBORI, KAWAKAMI VILLAGE RESIDENT:  We'll do the best we can, but the rest is up to Kintaro (ph). RIPLEY:  Both say it's OK if their son decides to leave someday. Population data does show more young people moving to the countryside, lured by the low cost of living, clean air, and low stress lifestyle.  The key question, is Japan doing enough to pull up its plunging population before it's too late? (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia. What planet as closest to Earth when it passes by? Mercury, Venus, Mars or Jupiter? It might not be the closest on average, but Venus's orbit brings it closer to Earth than any other planet. Up next, an out of this world story where, for the first time, scientists discovered evidence of recent volcanic activity on Venus. A closer look at archival radar images taken by NASA's Magellan spacecraft in the early 1990s revealed the new evidence on the surface of the planet.  But the new analysis shows that a region near Venus' equator grew over an 8th month span. And experts say this is geological evidence of volcanic activity. The Magellan mission ended in 1994. But NASA has new missions to Venus planned within a decade. Scientists are excited about what else they might discover about this enigmatic, rocky, potentially lava flowing planet. For today's story, getting a 10 out of 10, we're soaring to new heights.  Luke Czepiela attempting a world record, becoming the first to land a plane on top of Dubai's famed Burj Al-Arab hotel. It's actually a helipad, just 88 feet long, but Luke nails it. This is 56 stories above the ground. The red bull air race champ makes it look easy. But he's preparing since 2021, completing over 650 flight test landings on ground level.  So greatness does not come easy. The habits you're creating right now are creating the future you. This reminds me of a fable I heard. The great artist Picasso was walking down the street and he heard a young person yelling, "Picasso, Picasso, you're my favorite artist. Can you can you sign this napkin for me?" Picasso go makes a breathtaking piece of art. "Picasso, this is so beautiful. It only took you 5 seconds to do this." "My child," Picasso said, "It took me 20 years to be able to do this for you in 5 seconds." Master your craft, practice and outwork everyone every single day. Shout out to Carlson High School in Gibraltar, Michigan. Today from me and my CNN team, have a wonderful weekend, everyone. I'm Coy Wire and it's been a blessing to spend this week with. END230320

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, everyone. I'm Coy Wire. Hope you had a wonderful weekend. I am grateful to be right here with you to help jumpstart your week for the best ten minutes in news right here on CNN 10. Let's start today with an update on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  The International Criminal Court issued a war crimes arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday. This for an alleged scheme to deport thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia. Now, Russia called the actions outrageous and unacceptable and said the court's decisions are null and void in their country.  Like the U.S., China and other nations, Russia isn't a member of the court, so they don't recognize its jurisdiction. So the chances of Putin actually being in a courtroom over this seem slim to none. Putin and any other official would have to be arrested outside of Russia or handed over.  And if you think justice in general moves slowly, experts say international justice barely moves at all. But anyone accused of a crime in the jurisdiction of the court can be tried, even presidents. The court tries people, not countries, and focuses on those who hold the most responsibility.  That being said, this court is meant as a, "last resort," and it's not meant to replace any country's justice system. The White House has said that it welcomed accountability for perpetrators of war crimes, but stopped short of a full endorsement. And the U.S. also said they will continue to help Ukraine document Moscow's misdeeds.  Ten-second Trivia. Which of these terms refers to the red, green, and brown marine algae growing along seashores? Coral, Anemones, Seaweed, or Seagrass? Normally anchored to the sea floor seaweed can also be found floating on the ocean surface.  There's been a growing threat to tourism in the Caribbean in recent years. And now parts of Florida could be next. Seaweed is overwhelming normally beautiful beaches. A 5000 miles wide mass of seaweed is headed for Florida right now. That's twice as wide as the entire U.S. And it can smell like rotten eggs or sulfur when it washes ashore. For years, it's been wreaking havoc in the Caribbean and on some beaches around Cancun in Mexico. And it's getting worse.  Experts say one potential cause is agricultural runoff. Fertilizers, for example, for crops that wash into rivers and then eventually out to sea. Workers at some resorts are having to fill up dump trucks every day and haul mounds of the algae away. But it's relentless frustrating tourists in places where tourism is the heartbeat of the economy. Here's more now from our friend Leyla Santiago, our correspondent who's on the story in Florida.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOE KAPLAN, KEY WEST RESIDENT:  It's thick in the summertime, builds up and smells terrible.  LEYLA SANTIAGO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Joe Kaplan captured these images about a week ago. Massive amounts of seaweed washing up at Smathers Beach, a beach he knows well because he walks it several times a week.  KAPLAN:  I was shocked when I saw it that day where it wasn't even spring yet. It's still winter, which is very unusual.  CHUANMIN HU, USF COLLEGE OF MARINE SCIENCE:  And this is about a 5000 miles long.  SANTIAGO:  Professor Chuanmin, who is one of the leading experts on what many have referred to as a massive blob of seaweed heading to Florida's coast. (On camera):  Fair to call it a blob?  HU:  No. SANTIAGO:  No, we can't call it a blob, OK. HU:  I would never call that a blob. OK. SANTIAGO:  OK, why?  HU:  Because it's not.  SANTIAGO:  Satellite images, he says, show it's not one massive body of seaweed, rather a bunch of patchy clumps traveling from west Africa. It's called the Atlantic Sargassum Belt and is considered a natural phenomenon. Right now, it's twice the width of the U.S. carrying 6 million tons of seaweed and headed to the east coast.  HU:  In June of this year, it may turn into 20 million tons.  SANTIAGO:  So let me get this straight, this, what we're seeing the last month is 6 million tons and it's going to get bigger? HU:  Yes. There's no way to stop that. This is nature, just like no one can stop a hurricane.  SANTIAGO:  Should we be worried about that?  HU:  Nope.  SANTIAGO:  Why?  HU:  Reason is sargassum is not toxic. SANTIAGO:  But it smells pretty bad and it's a nuisance for those trying to keep beaches clean to attract tourists. Just a few years ago, here's what it looked like in Mexico, officials in Monroe county, which includes the Florida Keys, have set aside more than $200,000 to clean and remove sargassum from its beaches.  CAPTAIN DAN MATTHEWS, MISS CHIEF FISHING CHARTER:  Seaweed is a mixed blessing. We need it. Seaweed is a nursery for all these large pelagic fish. The negative side to that seaweed is if it comes in the concentrations that are believed, we're going to see our fishing grounds are going to be completely covered with it. There's almost no point to fishing because we're going to be spending the entire day cleaning weed off our lines.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Did you know that as of last summer, half of young adults ages 18 to 29 have roommates that are named mom and dad? Millions of young adults are living with their parents, and that's the most since the great depression. Some choose to live with their parents to save money and build for their futures. But many don't have a choice. The cost of housing is rising. Student loan debt is piling. So here's CNN's Correspondent Gabe Cohen who's been speaking to people across the country who are living at home after college.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GRACE LEMIRE, LIVES WITH PARENTS:  Yeah, it feels like home.  GABE COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Grace Lemire shows us her Massachusetts home.  LEMIRE:  So this is my childhood bedroom. COHEN:  Well, her parents' home. LEMIRE:  This is my mom's office.  COHEN:  The 24-year-old moved back after college and hasn't left, even though she's now making close to six figures running her own content marketing business.  LEMIRE:  I mean, it's been huge. I've been able to completely save an emergency fund. I have been able to put a lot of money onto my student loans. I have a bigger down payment for a future home. Those are things that are important to me and make living at home make more sense for me.  COHEN:  She posts about it on TikTok. LEMIRE:  But have you seen the rent prices out there?  COHEN:  And she's not alone.  JORDAN HOWLETT, LIVES WITH PARENTS:  Living by yourself is almost impossible.  COHEN:  Millions of young adults moved home during the pandemic, and many haven't left.  EMILY STONE, LIVES WITH PARENTS:  It's something that I used to be almost like, embarrassed or ashamed of, but not anymore.  COHEN:  As of last summer, 50% of adults 18 to 29 years old were living with their parents, according to Pew, down just slightly from 52% at the peak of the pandemic, the most since the Great Depression.  LEMIRE:  I would say most of my friends are actually living at home with their parents.  COHEN:  Housing costs are a key reason. The average rent nationwide, nearly $2,000 is 26% higher than at the start of COVID and only rising amid this high inflation.  CHRISTINE BRUNIK, LIVES WITH PARENTS:  I can't be financially stable if I want to go out and live on my own.  COHEN:  23-year-old Christine Brunilk has lived with her parents in a Minnesota suburb since finishing college. Renting her own place, she says, could cost half her marketing salary.  BRUNIK:  I feel kind of, like in a stagnant position.  COHEN (on camera):  What's your plan as of now? BRUNIK:  I'm hoping to move out in August, but again, that depends if I find roommates. COHEN:  Then there's student loan debt.  JON WILLIAMS, LIVES WITH PARENTS:  The goal is to just clear that out as quickly as I can.  COHEN:  26-year-old Jon Williams, a pharmacist in Michigan, moved into his parents basement after finishing grad school with $180,000 of student debt, he says.  WILLIAMS:  It has been a very minimalist lifestyle. I've saved over 80% of my net income.  COHEN:  When do you think you'll be able to clear your student debt?  WILLIAMS:  Probably late fall. I'm about three quarters of the way through it right now.  COHEN:  Are you getting antsy?  WILLIAMS:  I am getting slightly antsy. I do feel like 2023 would probably be a good year for me to move out.  COHEN:  Many Americans don't like this trend, 36% say that more young adults living with parents is bad for society, while 6% say it's good. According to Pew Research. LEMIRE:  I've been called a fraud and a freeloader.  COHEN:  Grace's mom had a different take.  NANCY LEMIRE, GRACE'S MOTHER:  If she's in a better position, then that gives us peace of mind. And when we get older, if we need help, she'll be in a better position to help us, right?  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Up next, let's hang 10 for CNN 10's 10 out of 10 story. Australian surf coach Blake Johnston broke the world record for longest surf session. He did it on Friday, surfing 40 straight hours in Sydney, Australia, breaking the previous record by about 10 hours. Stung by jellyfish thinking about potential shark attacks, he rode more than 600 waves for nearly two whole days. Think about how scary it must have been at nighttime.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10, and you are awesome. We have a great show for you today, so let's get to it. We're going to begin with the latest news on the protests in Israel. For the past 11 weeks on Saturday nights, protesters have taken to the streets in Israel to call for a government overhaul. Roughly half a million Israelis each week voicing their opposition to the government. That's 5% of the total population.  Protesters are angry at the government's plans to overhaul the country's judicial system, which would give Israeli's parliament the power to overrule Supreme Court decisions. Critics accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of pushing the legislation in order to get out of a corruption trial that he is currently facing.  But Netanyahu denies that, saying that the trials are collapsing on their own and that the government overhaul is necessary. On Monday, though, Netanyahu announced a key change to part of his plans due to the massive public protests and international pressure.  The concession would give Israeli governments less power to select new judges, but still more power than it has now. About 66% of Israelis believe the Supreme Court should have the power to strike down laws incompatible with Israeli's basic laws. And about the same proportion, 63% say they support the current system of nominating judges. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST:  As surely as night follows day, Saturday night these past eleven weeks in Israel has meant mass demonstrations against the government's judicial overhaul. Protesters are concerned it will remove pretty much all checks and balances on the government, allowing it to appoint allies as top judges and removing the Supreme Court's ability to strike down laws except in very narrow circumstances.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who leads the most right wing and religiously conservative government in Israel's history, says his overhaul is required to restore the balance between the government and the judiciary. But the protesters don't buy it. They worry it will rode Israel's claim to be a liberal democracy and that will damage the economy and infringe upon their freedoms of expression, worship, and the right to demonstrate.  President Isaac Herzog's attempts to broker compromise unveiled earlier this week were rejected by the government. And though his warnings of civil war seem far-fetched for now, so long as the overhaul continues its passage through parliament, the protest will continue.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Now for another installment of our CNN series, Call to Earth. We're traveling to Sydney, Australia, where one organization called Living Seawalls is changing the way we think about building infrastructure in the ocean. Experts are engineering seawalls to create critical habitats that are more hospitable to marine life that grows there. We're going to hear from marine experts who believe it's just as important to save the little creatures in the ocean as it is the big ones.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. ARIA LEE, LIVING SEAWALL PROJECT MANAGER:  I started getting into marine science when I was in my twenty s and was doing a lot of scuba diving. I was really interested in the tiny critters that were living in the marine environment. There's a lot of attention with biodiversity and conservation around the large fish like the sharks and the whales. But you have to remember that these organisms rely on smaller organisms in order to survive. We really need to start at the bottom and build up a really strong base on which to build up this food web. My name is Dr. Aria Lee and I'm the project manager for Living Seawall.  The problem in urbanized areas such as Sydney Harbor is that so much of the shoreline has been built over with artificial structures. Over 50% of the shoreline in Sydney Harbor has some sort of structure built upon it, whether it be a seawall, wharf or pontoon. And these artificial structures have taken away the sort of microhabitats like rock pools, crevices, tiny holes that you would see on a natural rocky shoreline.  So what Living Seawalls is doing is bringing back these natural habitat features to an artificial structure such as a sea wall. We, as marine ecologists went out and identified features of a natural shoreline that are missing from a flat featureless seawall. And we've translated that onto a Living Seawalls panel.  The panels are designed digitally and then a prototype is 3D printed. There are currently 14 Living Seawall sites around Sydney and around the entire world. We've installed over 1000 Living Seawalls habitat panels. We can certainly see the difference that the living SeaWorld panels make. The textures can provide seaweed a really strong hold onto the surface.  And that's extremely valuable for all the marine organisms that rely on the kelp, not just for protection and for homes, but as a food source. When there is a new construction, we want the designers to think about how they can design the structure to benefit both humans and the natural environment.  Right now, seawalls are really only useful for humans. They stop erosion. They protect the property that's behind it. What we want to do in the future is think about what the marine environment needs as well as what humans need, and that way we can build more sustainably for the future.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second Trivia. The childhood home of which fictional character was located at 4 Private Drive? Sherlock Holmes, Charlie Brown, Harry Potter or Katniss Everdeen? Set mostly in a fictional Britain, Harry Potter lived at his muggle home at 4 Privet Drive.  And for today's story, getting a 10 out of 10. We're traveling far from the British movie studios that produce the wonderful world of Harry Potter to Japan, where fans will be able to immerse themselves in some of the series most iconic moments at our parent company's, Warner Bros Studio Tour Tokyo, the Making of Harry Potter. Did you know the Harry Potter book series has sold a record half a billion copies, and it's been translated into at least 88 different languages.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Harry Potter's magic --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You're a wizard, Harry. STEWART:  -- is transporting to Tokyo. It's on this massive lot where fans will see some of the series most iconic sets, like the Great Hall at Hogwarts and the Forbidden Forest. It's part of the new Warner Bros Studio, soon to open in Japan.  (On camera):  What goes through your mind when you -- when you see the train, you see the sets, you see the costumes? JEFF NAGLER, PRESIDENT, WARNER BROTHERS WORLDWIDE STUDIO OPERATIONS:  Wow, I can't believe it. And when I come here, I have to remember that I'm here on a business trip and not to be looking at this as if I'm just a fan.  STEWART:  Jeff Nagler is President of Warner Brothers Worldwide studio operations.  (On camera):  Why Japan?  NAGLER:  I think that was one of the easiest decisions for us, actually, because of the whole global interest in Harry Potter after the United States and after the U.K., Japan is the third best area for Harry Potter fandom.  STEWART:  The Tokyo studio is modeled after the one in London and will be larger, a big draw, the Hogwarts Express train that was made in London, transported by land and by sea to its new home here in Japan.  (On camera):  It's not just about the sets, it's about the accessories, the costumes, the props, like the ones you've seen in the movies.  NOZOMI ANDO, TOU GUIDE (through translator):  We normally don't get to see what goes on behind the scenes in movies, but here we get to see how films get made. For example, it shows us how the people who work in the costume, props, movie set departments all work as a team.  STEWART:  Music a glimpse into movie magic far from Harry Potter's roots in the U.K.  (On camera):  Do you see Asia as a growth market for experiences like this?  NAGLER:  Absolutely. We do look at China and we look at Japan. We look at South Korea. We have a big fan base in Australia and New Zealand as well. All of that's not Asia, it's the whole Asia Pacific region.  STEWART:  Stories of imagination appealing to audiences around the world.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  That's all we have time for, for now. Wherever you go today, be awesome.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Wonderful Wednesday to you. It's #Yourwordwednesday. Follow me at Coy Wire on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, and put your unique vocabulary word in the comment section of my most recent post. And we'll choose one, fun one to work into tomorrow's show.  Last week word from @Brady E. Ellison was exorbitant, meaning unreasonably high price.  We're starting out today with news out of Los Angeles, where half a million students can't go to school because of a worker strike. The union, representing school custodians, cafeteria workers, bus drivers, and other support staff, is forcing the nation's second largest district to be shut down. Teachers are also participating in a strike this week in solidarity, and here's what the union wants, equitable wage increases, more full-time work, respectful treatment, and increased staffing. The union workers have an average salary of $25,000 a year, and most work part time, which has led to staffing shortages, according to the union. The cost of living in L.A. is relatively high now. The superintendent of the school district says they've tried to negotiate in good faith, but California law prevents the school system from putting itself in a position that could lead to bankruptcy. And if they gave in to all the demands of the union, well, they say, that's exactly where they'd be.  While some argue that the school workers strike this week would negatively impact students, the district is trying to offset that by offering help to families, by opening 24 grab and go food sites, having 154 schools provide student supervision, plus about 120 city run sites at libraries, recreation centers, and other locations.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  More than half a million kids will not be going to school today. The second largest district in the nation, more than a thousand schools in all, shut down by this strike, called by the union that reps the bus drivers, cafeteria workers, special ed assistants, and custodians. Like Jose Tovar, whose current wage puts him below the poverty line.  JOSE TOVAR, CUSTODIAN:  We're asking for the world, but they live above water.  MAX ARI, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SEI LOCAL 99:  One in three of our members is either homeless or has been houseless while working for LAUSD.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Their union is demanding large pay hikes, more full- time jobs, more staff, and, "respectful treatment." Some parents are sympathetic.  JENNA SCHWARTZ, PARENT:  We have some of our most underpaid workers doing some of the most challenging jobs on our campuses. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The district made an offer, including a pay rise, but only half the 30% demanded.  ALBERTO M. CARVALHO, SUPERINTENDENT, LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT:  Under California law, we cannot drive the school system into a bankruptcy position. And if we were to acquiesce to all of the demands, that is exactly where we would be. That is not legally allowable.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So half a million kids don't go to school while the adults argue.  MIKE BER, PARENT:  I support my kids, and ultimately, I feel that they're probably being left behind in a battle between, you know, adults.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Apparently, it's gotten ugly. The district calls this strike illegal, claiming it's all about the money, not the other stuff.  CARVALHO:  We have not been presented with compelling evidence that there's widespread abuses. Are there issues? Yes. Each one of them is vigorously investigated, and consequences are applied.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  During the strike, there will be some childcare provided at a few schools and parks and box lunches for the many who rely on free school meals.  The union claims 96% of its 30,000 or so members who work in the district voted for this, a strike scheduled to last three days. So barring any breakthroughs, there's no school until Friday.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia.  Which of these insects belongs to the genus Bombus?  Beetle, Butterfly, Bumblebee, or Bookworm? Times up, bumblebees, if you please, belong to the genus Bombus.  Some folks may think bees just randomly fly around feeding on flowers, pushing around pollen, and then hang out in the hives making honey. Turns out these insects are organized, smart and coachable. A recent study shows that bees can be trained to solve puzzles, and other bees can study a demonstrator bee to then accurately solve the puzzle themselves.  No wonder bees are able to divvy out responsibilities in hives with specific jobs and roles to strategically live their daily lives. Let's learn more now how for bees, teamwork makes the dream work.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Check this out, these bumblebees learned how to solve a puzzle. Then they taught their friends how to do it. The prize sugar. Researchers studied bumblebee colonies to see if they developed social learning, also known as learned behavior.  Scientists designed a two-option puzzle box that could be opened by pushing a red tab clockwise or a blue tab counterclockwise. One set of bees, called the demonstrator bees, were trained to use the blue or red tab. Other observer bees watched, and when it was their turn, most bees chose the same option they had observed from the trained bee. One professor said, our research shows, however, that new innovations can spread like social media memes through insect colonies, indicating that they can respond to wholly new environmental challenges much faster than by evolutionary changes. The researchers concluded that bees, like humans, are capable of culture by socially learning behavior.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story tallying a 10 out of 10 is a tale about tater tots. Now, don't get me wrong, it's super important to eat mostly fruits and vegetables and minimally processed, healthy foods that are good for our body and mind. When I played in the NFL, my motto was eat for purpose, not pleasure. But all of us, pro athlete or not, we have to eat some treat foods every now and then, right? Tater tots were invented back in 1953 in Oregon as a way to keep potato scraps from going to waste.  Let's go be spectators in Portland. Now, to learn more about the history of the tot and to see some wild and tasty tater creations.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDREA DAMEWOOD, PORTALND MERCURY, FOOD WRITER AND RESTAURANT CRITIC:  The food scene in Portland is really eclectic right now. When you're able to walk into a restaurant and see like, they're doing what now with tots, I got to try that.  One of the things that we do best is feel good, exciting, high low junk food. It's always going to be an element of Portland, and people love to eat that stuff. I mean, who doesn't want tots with mac and cheese and fried chicken on it?  If you can think about the cuisine, we have a tot for it. So there's Oaks Bottom, which coined the term totcho. That obviously has a Mexican bent to it. There's Japanese restaurant Boxer Ramen, and they do an okonomiyaki tot that is savory and is served with bonito flakes, which are fish flakes that kind of dance in the heat.  There's Korean tots, Cajun tots, Greek tots. I'm starting to feel like Bubba in Forrest Gump talking about shrimp. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp.  DAMEWOOD:  We basically have all of the tots. Tater tots were invented in Oregon in the 1950s, and that was the Ore-Ida company. And they took a look at a lot of potato scraps that they had and said, here's a way to monetize them. And so they formed them into these tots and they're now the tots we know and love today. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Heartbreak Hotel, we wrapped the bacon.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thanks, look at that.  DAMEWOOD:  In its own way, it's kind of a version of eating locals still in, like, a very hilarious frozen food way. Because Ore-Ida is an Oregon company.  ANTHONY BROWN, NACHEAUX, OWNER AND FLAVOR MASTER: Well, tater tot is very versatile. So I was thinking, how do I make this dish tater tots? House made sauce. How do you elevate tater tots? We'll do tot tacos as more and more people are doing things with tots I feel like the bar went from here to up here. So I feel like I need to, you know, just to stay relevant and make sure that we're still crushing it.  DAMEWOOD:  I think most people who come to Portland are into food. Pound of tots, grilled onions, bacon and cheddar cheese with a fried egg on top, brunch in a bowl. This is a place where if you like to eat and you also want to be able to walk it off in between meals, this is it. This is the spot.  (END VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Coy? WIRE:  Oh, sorry, Jeremy. I was in deep time (ph). I want to thank everyone for commending my dad jokes and asking me to do more of them. I don't always tell dad jokes, but when I do he laughs.  And now, special shout out going to Utah today. Kanab High School in Kanab. We see you, Ta. Did you know that Utah's nicknamed the Beehive State, coming from the belief that each person works together to support one another. You better believe we appreciate you. Much love and many blessings.  I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10. END230323

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Hope you're having a great week. But for those of us who are having a tough one, they're unavoidable, they happen. Remember, tough times make us tougher. So just smell the flowers and cool the soup and know that you will be OK. It's Thursday. Happy Friday Eve. Welcome to CNN 10. I'm Coy Wire. Let's start with the latest on Ukraine as the country continues to fight Russia's invasion, the United States and other countries around the world are sending weapons to Ukraine to help them defend their homeland. The State Department said on Monday that the U.S. will send Ukraine $350 million in weapons and equipment. The latest aid includes rockets, fuel tanker trucks, and riverboats. The U.S. will also deploy its Abrams tanks, which has advanced capabilities and speed. And did you know that at Fort Sill in Oklahoma, the U.S. has been instructing top Ukrainians on U.S. weapons systems. So, they'll be prepared to use the equipment and training in the conflict? The Ukrainian soldiers apparently picked up the material so quickly that they were given more instruction than originally planned the individuals training in the U.S. were handpicked by Ukrainian military leaders. This comes amid concerns from the United States and its allies that China may plan to send lethal aid to Russia, though China denied it earlier this month. CNN White House Reporter Natasha Bertrand traveled to Oklahoma to see the training taking place at Fort Sill. So, let's hear more about what she's learned. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: The United States fast tracking key weapons for Ukraine's fight against Russia heavy U.S. tanks now set to be deployed to the country faster than originally planned. BRIG. GEN. PATRICK RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: DoD, in close coordination with Ukraine, has made the decision to provide the M1A1 variant of the Abrams tank which will enable us to significantly expedite delivery timelines and deliver this important capability to Ukraine by the fall of this year. BERTRAND: Patriot missile defense systems also due to arrive in Ukraine in the coming weeks, defense officials told CNN much sooner than anticipated. REAR ADMIRAL JOHN KIRBY, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR: They're wrapping up training on things like the Patriot air defense system. I mean, we're doing everything we can to make sure that they're ready as best they can be for these critical weeks and months ahead. BERTRAND: CNN was invited to observe the Patriot training here in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where 65 Ukrainian soldiers, ages 19 to 67 have been undergoing an intensive 10-week training course on the Patriot systems. Here you can see behind me a decommissioned system much like the one the Ukrainians will be using once they get back to their home country. BRIG. GEN. SHANE MORGAN, COMMANDING GEN. FIRES CENTER OF EXCELLENCE: Our assessment is that the Ukrainian soldiers are impressive and absolutely a quick study due to their extensive air defense knowledge and experience in a combat zone. It was easier, though never easy, for them to grasp the Patriot system operations and maintenance concepts. BERTRAND: But the stakes are so high that CNN was not allowed to film or photograph the training, an effort to protect the Ukrainians who will be back on the front lines in just a matter of weeks and to shield the U.S. from blowback from Moscow. U.S. officials emphasizing that the Patriots are purely defensive and not a threat to Russia. LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It's a point defense system. It's got to be placed in a location that is defending a target like a capital city, Kyiv or a port city like Odesa. So this is not a weapon system that can be moved around on the battlefield based on changing threats. BERTRAND: The systems will, however, help defend Ukraine against near daily missile barrages by Russia and will now likely be on the battlefield in time to support a looming Ukrainian counter offensive. REP. MIKE QUIGLEY, CO-CHAIR, CONGRESSIONAL UKRAINE CAUCUS: What did Zelenskyy say when I met him in Kyiv? He said, help us win quickly. It's exactly what he said when he visited Washington, D.C. recently. And is even what Secretary Austin said he said Ukraine doesn't have time. This spring offensive is coming. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Researchers at Columbia University set out on a mission to create the perfect cheesecake with 3D printing. Now, this concept of using a machine to make a three-dimensional, tangible, solid object from a digital file has been around for decades. It wasn't until around 2005 that 3D printing started to become more mainstream. Let's see how these scientists fared in their quest to create the perfect cheesecake using a printer. Something tells me that in the future, many of us are going to be reminiscent about the halcyon days when our food was made with a human's touch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. JONATHAN BLUTINGER, CREATIVE MACHINES LAB, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY: The general principle here is as soon as you kind of touch software with an industry, you don't really go back. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jonathan Blutinger and his team at Columbia's Creative Machines Lab attempted over and over and over to make that very satisfying cheesecake using a 3D printer. The results were terrible until they realized cheesecake's creamy, soft texture required some rethinking. To back up, 3D printed food has been around for years. You can find companies working on candies, sugar decorations and pancakes. One California company, Sugar Lab, has treats you can purchase right now for around $20. But at Columbia University, the researchers were dealing with something that's pretty well mushy. BLUTINGER: We didn't really think about the rheology of jelly and banana being so soft and kind of mushy that it kind of just crumbled as soon as the graham cracker paste kind of created a ceiling on top of it. So, it was a -- it was sobering experience. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If they could figure it out, this technology could give cooks greater control over nutrition and calorie counts. And 3D printing cuts down on human handling, which minimizes potential contamination. After a few more tries, they discovered the tricks that worked. BLUTINGER: Then we quickly started to think and try to create little walls and kind of little pockets to hold some of these softer ingredients. We got to a point that was pretty exciting. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The now well-structured cheesecake just needed a finishing touch. In this case, the added flair was one that separates Columbia from their 3D printing counterparts. Blutinger used a touch of laser cooking that toasted the top with exacting precision not found in any other cooking appliance. And the taste? BLUTINGER: Because the ingredients were packed together, you can really taste each ingredient in waves. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Now, it's time for a story that's dyno mite and it's getting today's 10 out of 10. The dad of two fur babies, two dogs played an epic prank on his pups by putting on a puffed-up T. rex costume. And then he prowled around in the backyard. And what ensued was a dorosauruval. Our Jeanne Moos has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT: A mere glimpse of green, some sort of alien being out in the backyard. And these two boxers, brother and sister, go nuts. T. rex taunting them through the glass at their Las Vegas home. (On camera): So, who is in that costume? JANEEN WALSH: Oh, it was my husband. MOOS (voice-over): Janeen Walsh put her husband Andrew up to it. Nico and Stella were wary at first but got bolder and bolder. Janeen could barely stifle her laughter. Jurassic Bark with one commenter, though, in that movie franchise, the dinosaur scared a dog to death. But Nico and Stella were fearless. (On camera): You don't think they smelled your husband and recognized him? WALSH: At first, they didn't. I could tell at first, they had no idea what it was. MOOS (voice-over): These are dogs not afraid to rum with a rumba. WALSH: No. MOOS: Their pursuit of the T. rex lasted about a minute before he went down for the count. MOOS: Janeen says her husband wasn't scared. Andrew has rolled around with the dogs before, minus the dino suit. MOOS: Finally, Janeen stopped laughing long enough to ask. WALSH: Are you OK? MOOS: The boxers didn't bite, but they made holes. WALSH: This is where Nico then decided he wanted to dive inside of it and get my husband. MOOS: At least, unlike the dinosaurs, her husband didn't go extinct. WALSH: Are you alive? (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right, everyone. We had so many. great, Your Word Wednesday submissions yesterday. Thanks to today's winners from Mr. Charles (ph) class at Dwight D. Eisenhower in West Berlin, New Jersey.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, hello, hello. We made it. Friday is here. The most wonderful time of the week. And it's been an awesome one. We've had some fun, learned a lot, and I've even got to meet one of you from Booker T. Washington Magnet High School in Montgomery, Alabama. What's up, Asha (ph)? And Dr. Simone Thomas, thanks for making us part of your class each and every day.  All right, we're starting today with the latest news from Capitol Hill, where the CEO of TikTok is facing withering criticism from lawmakers. The app, which has a reported 150 million users in the United States alone, is facing a potential U.S. ban over national security concerns. This stems from the fact that its parent company, ByteDance, is based in China. And on Thursday, some lawmakers made their case at the TikTok congressional hearing.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CATHY M. RODGERS, (R) CHAIR, ENERGY & COMMERCE COMMITTEE:  We do not trust TikTok will ever embrace American values, values for freedom, human rights, and innovation. TikTok has repeatedly chosen the path for more control, more surveillance, and more manipulation. Your platform should be banned.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Now, the CEO, Shou Chew, is pushing back hard, saying the app is not a vehicle for the Chinese government to spy or spread propaganda in the United States, and that its new security model has American users data being stored in America by an American company. Here's part of his testimony yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHOU CHEW, TIKTOK CEO:  The bottom line is this, American data stored on American soil by an American company overseen by American personnel. We call this Initiative Project Texas. That's why Oracle is headquartered. Today, U.S. TikTok data is stored by default in Oracle service only vetted personnel operating in a new company called TikTok. U.S. data security can control access to this data.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Let's go to CNN Business Writer Clare Duffy for more.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER:  Yeah, it does sort of feel like deja vu from 2020. We were having a lot of these same conversations about whether TikTok would be banned in the U.S. except for now it is so much more popular than It was even back then.  LUCY HOCKINGS:  TikTok --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here's what you need to know about TikTok and why there's so much pressure to ban it.  SEN. JOHN THUNE (R) SOUTH DAKOTA:  But I'm particularly concerned about TikTok's connections to the Chinese Communist Party, which repeatedly --  DUFFY:  So, there are range of concerns about TikTok, but the main concern is really rooted in TikTok's connection to China. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance is based in China, and lawmakers are concerned that the Chinese government could use that connection to access U.S. user data.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  TikTok collects a range of data from its users, including users location, IP addresses, what type of device they're using, and even what users are typing on their keyboards. Under Chinese Communist Party laws, the Chinese government can demand TikTok hand over that data.  DUFFY:  And so it's really a range of data, and some of it, you could say, you know, what is the Chinese Communist Party really going to do with what kind of device I'm accessing TikTok on? But I think the concern is that some of that information, like location data, could be used for intelligence operations for certain folks using the app. That's why a lot of state governments have banned government officials from using the app on their phone.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Those concerns aren't without merit. In December of 2022, ByteDance admitted that employees within the company had accessed the personal data of at least two foreign journalists, including information about their location.  OLIVER DOWDEN, CHANCELLOR, THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER:  We are also going to ban the use of TikTok on government devices.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The U.S. government, it's military, multiple state governments, the E.U., U.K and Canada have all restricted the use of TikTok on government devices, citing security concerns.  DUFFY:  There's also a concern that the Chinese government could force TikTok to spread propaganda to U.S. users, and that would affect users much more broadly than just government officials.  VANESSA PAPPAS, TIKTOK'S CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER:  We have never shared data with the Chinese government, correct.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  With the Chinese Communist Party?  PAPPAS:  Yes, correct.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  TikTok's Chief Operating Officer told Congress that the company would not give US. User data to the Chinese government, but avoided saying whether or not its parent company, ByteDance, would do the same.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's not the point. That's not my question. That's not my question. My question is, does any employee who has access to U.S. user data, are they members of the Chinese Communist Party? You won't answer that question? PAPPAS: And again, as a Global Tech --  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  China has said numerous times that fears about the government's influence are overblown.  WANG WENBIN, SPOKESPERSON, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY (through translation):  So far, the United States has been able to provide any evidence that TikTok is a national security threat. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In the end, it's pretty safe to say that if TikTok was owned by a U.S.-based company, you wouldn't be hearing anything at all about national security concerns, after all, many apps on your phone are already collecting similar data that TikTok does, including your location.  DUFFY:  It's a question of how much you're comfortable with your data being shared with any app? I think it's a question that people should be asking about all of their app usage, and you should be paying attention to, you know, the settings that you have in your apps. Do you -- how much do you allow your apps to access your location data or your contacts? Are you comfortable with that? I think this is something that people should be thinking about with TikTok, but also beyond TikTok, with all the apps that they use on their phones.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia.  What's the largest country in Western Europe?  The United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, or France?  At over 200,000 square miles, France is about the size of one and a half California's or two Colorado.  We're heading to France now where the country continues to face ongoing protests over the government's plan to overhaul the pension system. The government wants to change the national retirement age from 62 to 64 and the government says the current system is already not economically sustainable and says that citizens are living longer now. So something needs to change.  Here's CNN's Senior International Correspondent Sam Kiley on the ground in Paris with more.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Violent protests, garbage on the streets and two no confidence votes, President Macron's plan to overhaul the French pension system has caused uproar.  But why all the fuss? As France's population ages and the French live longer, the government here says that it can't afford the pension scheme that allows retirement at 62, so it's raising the majority pensionable age to 64. Opponents of the reform argue that the changes will hit blue collar workers because they start work earlier in life and women unfairly.  The opposition has been vocal and strikes have hit across the country since mid-January. Parisian streets have been choked with 10,000 tons of rubbish as a result of a garbage collector's strike. But public transport and even the oil industry have been affected. Aside from the content of the reform, many in France have been upset by the manner in which they've been rammed through without parliamentary support.  Fearing that the law wouldn't secure a majority vote for pension reform in the National Assembly, Macron's Prime Minister invoked a constitutional mechanism that allows the President to force fiscal legislation onto the statute book without a vote, and that sparked nationwide demonstrations and violence in Paris, especially. On Monday, the government survived two national assembly no confidence votes.  The bills are now likely to become law, and Macron faces opposition from the French far right, the far left and a sizable chunk of the center. And the angers against the reforms show no signs of ending and could hobble his second term in the Elysee Palace.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10, it's unbearably cute. How would you like to become a professional bear hugger? Yep, that's right. It's plausible to get paid to give literal bear hugs. The details of New Mexico Department of Game and Fish's job listing for conservation officer includes the willingness to crawl into bear dens and hug baby bears like this one. Look at those cute little paws.  But my question is, wouldn't mama bear be a little upset about this? I'm cool. I'm going to just stick with virtual bear hugs and air hugs to all of you.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hey, everyone. Terrific Tuesday to you. I'm Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. You're off to great places. Today is your day. Your mountain is waiting, so get on your way. Dr. Seuss, y'all got to love it. Today's top story has taken us to Israel. Unprecedented wave of protests and strikes is bringing the country to the brink of a shutdown. For months, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets, protesting changes to Israel's legal system.  But over the weekend, tensions rose higher when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suddenly fired the country's Defense Minister, who'd called for a pause in the government's judicial reform efforts.  The country's proposed overhaul would give Israel's parliament more control over the judiciary, including how judges are selected, what laws the Supreme Court can rule on, and it would also give the power to the government to overturn Supreme Court rulings.  Critics say these changes threaten the country's democracy, removing checks and balances on the government, saying that there is no check on the government's power other than the Supreme Court. Critics worry that if politicians have more control, the rights of minorities in Israel, especially Palestinians, would suffer.  The government maintains that it received a mandate to pass this reform when it was elected last November. And Netanyahu and his supporters argue that they've called for reform because Israel's judiciary has no written constitution, only a set of basic laws making the Supreme Court too powerful.  They also say the Supreme Court doesn't represent the Israeli people and that it has overstepped its bounds on certain issues. Protest, organizers said that they would continue to intensify demonstrations until the legislation was halted and seemingly in an effort to bring down tensions, a deal to postpone the government's judicial reform efforts was reached yesterday afternoon. You can head to CNN.com for updates.  Ten second trivia.  Which of these names translates to "snow covered mountains"? Pyrenees, Sierra Madre, Appalachian, or Sierra Nevada?  In Spanish, Sierra means mountain range. Nevada means snowclad.  California has been through it when it comes to weather. For the last three years, the state has been in a desperate need of rain. Just a month ago, about 33 million people were facing what's been called a mega drought. But now the pendulum has swung. Atmospheric rivers or narrow corridors of intense moisture in the atmosphere, dumping record rain and snowfall across the state. It's led to flooding, mudslides and more. Our CNN Meteorologist, Alli Chinchar is here to take us on a tour of the Sierra Nevada and break it all down for us. Also telling us how much rain and snow we're talking about.  ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Coy, it has been a record-breaking season of snowfall across the sierras this year. Take a look at this video. The snowfall piling up as high as a two-storey house and then some. This video is even taken back on February 28, and they've had even more snow since then.  But here's the thing about the sierras. It's broken into three separate categories. You have the northern, the central, and the southern region of the sierras. And all three of them, when you look, have actually been very impressive this year. But specifically, the southern sierras picking up 200, 86% of their snow water equivalent. What is that? Basically what it is. It takes into account all the snow pack that's on the ground. But then if you melted it, what would the water equivalent be?  And in the case of the southern sierras, it's been record breaking snow water equivalent. But how does this year compare to other years in the past? Let's break it down. This year has been extremely impressive, 228% of normal for that snow water equivalent.  When you look back at the previous years, they haven't even made it to normal amounts, let alone the impressive amount that we've had so far this year. But one thing to note is the impact it's had on the drought.  Now, when you get numerous systems like this and we've had at least a dozen atmospheric river events back-to-back, basically all of that water has to go somewhere. It's not just the rain coming down from the sky, but it melts some of that snowpack.  And then all of that water flows into rivers, creeks, and streams, and also onto roadways, into homes, into businesses, because those rivers, creeks, and streams end up becoming swollen and it's too much for the ground to absorb all at once.  Now, in the short-term, however, though, this has been very beneficial for the short-term drought. Look at California just back on December 6, when we had the extreme and exceptional drought categories. Fast forward to just a few days ago. Not a single portion of California is in those exceptional and extreme drought categories anymore.  WIRE:  Now, that's a good thing. Thanks, Alli. Any weather questions, reach out to @ Allison Chinchar on social.  All right. Up next, some inspiration and motivation from one of our CNN heroes, John Watson. He's a fitness instructor who created bloom fitness in honor of his daughter Emma. Mr. Watson leads students facing intellectual and developmental challenges through classes that unite, uplift and invigorate with great passion and energy.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOHN WATSON, BLOOM FITNESS INSTRUCTOR:  Yes. Come on, Cheryl. I need you.  When I'm front of them, it's an explosion of excitement every single time.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to do a spring cycle class.  ATHLETES:  Yes.  WATSON:  Bloom's mission is to lead people with intellectual and developmental disabilities to a lifetime of fitness.  (On camera):  These are really good bikes. You're going to love it. OK. (Voice-over):  Wellness and movement for this population, that's critical.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Amy is our fourth child.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Heart problems are very common for people with down syndrome, so fitness is very important.  WATSON:  All right, so you all been very patient today, so I might make some mistakes. You all okay with that?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Rafi has Prader-Willi syndrome. She has a very low metabolism, so she needs to keep moving and keep motivated. WATSON:  Let's rock and roll. We all know the benefits of fitness. Physical, emotional, and cognitive but they don't usually connect those dots.  (On camera):  Two, one, go.  (Voice-over):  Safety is first. But we want them to have fun. We want them to want to do it.  (On camera):  There you go. I love it. How are you cracking it over there? Hello, baby. You got it.  (Voice-over):  We wanted to make sure that the athlete that's in the room feels seen.  My daughter, Emma. Her diagnosis is basically cerebral palsy. She has balance problems. She's legally blind. She developed epilepsy, some seizures. But it's easy with them on to focus on the good parts.  Emma, you hoping to get a low one here?  EMMA:  No.  WATSON:  You're inspired how they work through challenges. I was looking for services for Emma and ways to help other parents. And so I came across a service provider. And when we walked around, they had a room with broken down fitness equipment. Guys, what happens here? They said nothing happens here. And I said, well, do you mind if I buy some bikes?  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Hi, Richanna (ph). Come on in. WATSON:  We partner with these organizations that provide services for adults with disabilities. The cost to the athlete is nothing.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Both arms up overhead, inhale deeply.  WATSON:  All of our instructors are volunteers. We do Pilates, yoga, dance. Our classes are modified.  (On camera):  We're going to do little steps. That's where we're going to start.  (Voice-over):  We have a wide range of abilities. Somebody that may have limited movement. We specifically try to get them to move to how they can.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The energy, the excitement that they have to be a part of a team that means a lot to them.  WATSON:  Ryan, killing it. Come on, Cheryl, we're almost done.  (voice-over):  You're an athlete, no matter what your ability level is.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 musical artist, The Weeknd becoming the first in Spotify history to reach 100 million monthly listeners. It's a new Guinness World record. The Weeknd started making his name back in 2009, but this recent streaming surge was due to a collaboration with singer Ariana Grande that went viral on TikTok in 2021.  I wanted what Guinness World Record we could try to break right here on CNN 10. Maybe we'll figure it out.  Now, I went to a bookstore and I saw a book titled, How to End 50% of Your Problems. So I bought two of them. Dad Jokes onto my favorite part of the day.  Now, I want to give a special shout out to Kernersville Middle School in Kernersville, North Carolina. We see you.

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, everyone. Coy Wire here. Wishing a wonderful Wednesday to you. I know we're just halfway through the week, but we're going to keep on grinding and shining, looking to be a little better today than we were yesterday. Now we are looking to the skies for our lead story today for the latest news on travel. March and April, they're considered peak season for spring break travel in America, and industry officials expect that upwards of 150 million people will fly during that two-month window alone. Travel is so busy during this time that officials at major spring break destinations like Miami, Orlando, Phoenix, Las Vegas and Los Angeles are asking passengers to arrive three hours early to the airport. One of our CNN 10 producers, Maya, said that she'd never seen security so packed at LaGuardia Airport in New York when she flew over the weekend. But tourism experts say that travel during this year's spring break actually isn't even as bad as it could have been. Bad flying experiences from last year have made some people skeptical about flying. Canceled flights and missed layovers left hundreds of thousands of travelers stranded. A series of close calls on runways has left some worried about their safety. And staffing shortages of aircraft technicians, flight dispatchers and pilots have some folks worrying about the efficiency of airlines and airports. So given all that, experts say that some travelers are playing it safe this year. Staying close to home. We'll hear now from CNN Correspondent Pete Muntean with tips for traveling from experts and passengers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT:  Spring break travel is soaring back to normal and renewing worry that your flight could be canceled. Meltdowns plagued the FAA in January. Southwest airlines over the holidays and industry wide last summer. GEOFF FREEMAN, PRESIDENT & CEO, U.S. TRAVEL ASSOCIATION:  The air travel system is under great stress. MUNTEAN:  The Federal Aviation Administration is already warning of a shortage of air traffic controllers that could cause increased delays. At New York's three major airports this summer, there a key air traffic control facility is at only 54% staffing. FREEMAN:  We're seeing it with delays, we're seeing with cancellations and that is leading some travelers to say, you know what, I would travel more if we could fix that air travel experience. MUNTEAN:  The latest figures from travel site Hopper show many travelers are concerned about flight disruptions. 20% of Hopper's spring break travelers are buying extra trip protection. That's on top of rising airfare up 4%, Hopper says, compared to 2019. KEN DANIELS, TRAVELER:  They were quite pricey this time of year. I guess due to spring break and due to what's going on in the economy. BYRON WITHERSPOON, TRAVELER:  They go up one day, they go down the next day. Just be diligent and be on point and when you see that good price, you won't hit the button. MUNTEAN:  Even still industry figures say 158 million Americans will fly for spring break. That's an average of 2.6 million travelers each day. HAYLEY BERG, LEAD ECONOMIST, HOPPER:  We're expecting this spring break to likely break records for number of travelers who are getting out there and how much they're spending given the huge demand coming out of the pandemic. MUNTEAN:  The top destinations Las Vegas, Orlando, Phoenix, Los Angeles and Miami where the airport says demand is 20% higher than 2019. So high that officials are asking you to show up three hours before a domestic flight instead of the typical two hours. GREG CHIN, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:  There are very few off-peak times right now for us. We have been the best alternative to leaving the country since COVID. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten second trivia. What country shown here is located between India and Myanmar? Bangladesh, Thailand, Laos or Nepal? Home to over 165 million people, Bangladesh is the country shown on the map. A tech company is looking to bring a technology called iFarmer to farmers in Bangladesh, which provides them with financial resources and advice. The company's mission is to empower the farmers to yield more from the same amount of land. The catch is that investors in the technology charge the farmers a commission on their output, and that could be seen as taking advantage of those doing the hard labor. We'll learn more now about the software, which is said to have furthered the livelihood of 17 million farming households. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Here along the banks of the Jamuna River, around 100 miles northwest of Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, Hanufa Bibi farms chili peppers and corn. Yield is low recently, she says, due to changing weather conditions. But the 35-year-old farmer is looking to technology for solutions, an app called iFarmer. HANUFA BIBI, FARMER (through translator):  After iFarmer help we've had a good experience. We've got a good yield of corn, a good harvest, and we are profiting well. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  iFarmer hopes to further the livelihoods of Bangladesh's 17 million farming households. FAHD IFAZ, FOUNDER AND CEO, IFARMER:  iFarmer is an agri-tech company that provides farmers with access to finance, access to advisory services, and we help farmers to take their produce to the market. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Established in 2019, the startup scaled rapidly from a team of four to over 250 employees today, facilitating more than $19 million in small loans for farmers across the country, so far, they say. Agriculture is a vital part of Bangladesh's economy. Nearly half of the country's population is employed in the industry, with more than 70% of its land used for farming. However, farming's contribution to GDP is in decline. 25-year-old corn farmer, Jahidul Islam (ph), says the startup helped him set up a bank account and apply for a loan of around $470. And use soil sensors to give him personalized information about his crops. At the nearby iFarmer Center, Islam can also get advice on farming and purchase seeds, pesticides and fertilizers. iFarmer opened 100 of these centers, which it says supports more than 87,000 farmers using its platform. The startup plans to launch 1000 centers by the end of the year, with the hope of supporting half a million farmers by 2025. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 is a real catch. A women's high school softball game in Texas took an unexpected turn when a base runner dodged and danced and pulled off an unbelievable prank on the catcher. It's not all that off base to say that this is an all-time must-see base running fake. Jeanne Moos has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Forget strikeouts, this was a fake out. Jada Walton from Carthage High School in East Texas headed for home plate, almost got tagged out and then pointed to first base. It's the classic made you look, look over there. The oldest trick in the book. And take another look. JADA WALTON, CARTHAGE SENIOR:  I really had no idea what to do. I was really just goofing around because I thought I was going to be out. MOOS:  Jada made it to home plate using the technique some use to steal food off a plate. The same Russ Marty used to sucker punch biff. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whoa biff? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What? MOOS:  And Back to the future that Arnold deployed -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Elephant. MOOS:  -- who escape in Last Action Hero Inside Edition dubbed Jada. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The Houdini of Softball. MOOS:  Even Major League Baseball gushed, you must see this all-time great base running fake out. As for those who said, the catcher deserves to be benched, Jada cried foul. I probably would have fell for it. Anybody would because she is really like a good player. Like she's the best on the team. MOOS:  By the way, Carthage won the game seven to five. And Jada won, bragging right. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Now that was awesome. We love when you touch base with us. It's #yourwordwednesday. So, follow me at Coy Wire on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok and put your unique vocab word in the comments section of my most recent post. And we're going to choose one fun one to work into tomorrow's show. Last week's vocab word was from Mr. Tros (ph) class at Dwight D. Eisenhower in West Berlin. Halcyon, meaning happier, peaceful times of the past. Now, for a special shout out, let's go to Michigan, Fruitport, Michigan and say, what's up, Fruitport Middle School, rise up. Thanks for all the love. Love right back at you. See you tomorrow, everyone. I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10. END230330

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hey, everybody, happy Thursday, or as I like to say, happy Friday eve. Overmorrow it will be Saturday. But first, let's finish this week strong. We've got a lot to get to, not a lot of time to do it, so let's get to it.  Now, teacher we're going to whip through some headlines, and as always, we recommend you preview each episode of CNN 10. One of them today involves coverage of school safety concerns following news out of Nashville this week. Here are some headlines from around the world.  This month, the U.S. and South Korea restarted joint military drills on the Korean Peninsula, including this simulated storming of a beach. These drills previously took place annually, but they hadn't happened at this scale in five years. The U.S. maintains that the drills are defensive in nature, while North Korea views this military cooperation as a threat.  In the United States, six people were killed in a school shooting in Nashville on Monday. This marked the 16th school shooting this year in the U.S. The tragic event has sparked further debate among lawmakers in Washington, D.C. over U.S. gun control laws and has many parents and school officials reviewing their safety protocols yet again.  Finally, in the art world, scientists say they've identified a secret ingredient in Leonardo da Vinci's paintings, egg yolks. That's right. According to a new study published this week, European painting masters like da Vinci may have used proteins, especially egg yolks, in their oil paintings.  This new study finds that the inclusion of egg was intentional and was a technique used to fine tune properties of the paint. That wraps your quick look at the headlines. Now pop quiz, hotshot.  Ten second trivia.  What is the capital of Australia? Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne or Brisbane?  Though Melbourne was once the capital, Canberra became the official capital of Australia in 1927.  Being a firefight fighter is one of the most dangerous professions on the planet. And did you know that wildfires in Australia are some of the largest and hottest on the planet? They can be devastating, completely destroying homes and habitats alike. But there's a group of volunteer firefighters in New South Wales working without pay to keep people and animals safe. We're going to meet two of these heroic people to hear why they're willing to risk it all to keep others safe.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAUREN WILSON, ADVANCE FIREFIGHTER, OAKS RURAL FIRE BRIGADE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL: When I tell people I'm a firefighter, I actually get a lot of mixed reactions. Oh, you do all that for free? What makes you do that? It really does spark a lot of curiosity in people.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Australia battles some of the largest and hottest wildfires on the planet. The fire season in Australia typically runs from October until the end of March, when temperatures are at their highest. Most of the firefighting is conducted by the Rural Fire Service, a volunteer force separate to state emergency services. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service has more than 70,000 members.  ANDREW HAIN, SENIOR DEPUTY CAPTAIN, PICTON RURAL FIRE BRIGADE INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT PLANNER: We were founded in 1939 by local farmers and local residents that needed a firefighting service in the area, and it was a bunch of guys with old trucks or trailers. Now we're sitting here in a million dollar plus facility with these trucks that are basically a multi- tool. We do flood work in this. We do fires, car accidents, house fires.  WILSON: We're coming into a family of a long line of firefighters. I believe there is that little bit of pressure. I can remember when I first told my father-in-law that I had joined. The first thing he said to me was, as long as you can operate a pump, you'll be fine.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As a volunteer service, recruits come from all walks of life and require intense training before being deployed.  HAIN: It's a huge amount of effort. A lot of hours go into training a new recruit. It's not for bragging rights, it's because they've got to go out on the truck with you. You need to be able to work with everybody from different backgrounds. You know, people that work in corporate, people that work in construction, you'd name it. We've probably got it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (Inaudible) they've come Picton 1 blue.  HAIN: The common thing is this desire to help people. So you've got to be willing to give your time to someone else for a thank you.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In 2019 and 2020, what became known as the Black Summer Fires burned 10.3 million land across the country.  HAIN: We were tasked to go into property protection, but the house was in a spot that was very difficult to defend. One road in, one road out. But then you walk around this house and you look in the back window and it is a carbon copy of my kids bedroom. There's Lego all over the floor, there's posters on the wall. This family have literally bundled everything they can into the car and they've left. They don't know that there's someone there to look after their house, but you staying there and maybe putting in that extra time and that extra work is going to be the reason they have a house to come back to.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The deadly fires claimed 33 lives, including nine firefighters. More than 3000 homes were destroyed. The house Andrew and his crew protected was one of 14,000 saved in New South Wales. Recent years have seen some of the largest fires ever recorded. Unchecked climate change means they could grow larger still.  HAIN: When I was growing up, there'd be fires and they'd occur, but there was nothing massive. Now they seem to be getting bigger and they talk about megafires and giga fires just on that scale. I don't recall anything like that.  The balance for work life, family life and the RFS can be difficult. I've got a five-year-old and a seven-year-old kid.  There any little boys at home?  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Daddy. Daddy.  HAIN: Hello, buddy.  They see the yellow shirt goes on and they know something's happening. You know, they'll be like, handing me car keys as I'm going out the door. They're like a little support crew. It's quite funny.  It gets difficult to juggle, but the rewards worth it. When someone says, you know, we need help, and then you can be the person to go and deliver that help, that's very rewarding.  There's nothing tangible that you get given for it. It's just a sense of pride. I'll be with the service for as long as I can be, but whether that's time and an able body, or whether it just ends up not maybe being an able body. I'm just one of those old guys telling war stories. If it's of benefit, I'll be here for as long as they'll have me.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  I don't know if I need to quack any jokes today, because today's story, getting a 10 out of 10 about ducks is funny enough. There's an historic hotel in Memphis, Tennessee, called the Peabody, and it's said that the famous Peabody ducks own the hotel. They're basically celebrities treated like royalty. And hundreds of people gather every day to see a tradition that dates back 90 years, the March of the Peabody Ducks.  Why don't you see this? Meet the Duckmaster, Mr. Kenon Walker.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KENON WALKER, DUCKMASTER, THE PEABODY MEMPHIS: The duck march ceremony is exclusive to the Peabody Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee. There was a general manager back in 1933 that went on a duck hunting trip with a friend of his over in Arkansas. As a practical joke, they decided to bring back the live duck decoys that they were using and set them loose inside that fountain. Now, when the general manager woke back up the next morning in a clear mindset, I'm sure he probably got up and was like, when he got down here, there was a crowd of people standing around the fountain staring at these ducks.  So that led to ducks living in the fountain. But then seven years later, a man by the name of Edward Pembroke just so happened that he was an animal trainer in the Ringling Brothers in Barnum in Bailey Circus as a young man. And he was the one that came up with the idea of turning the ducks that's living in the fountain into a ceremony.  I have the honor and the pleasure of marching the ducks for you all this morning.  My title here at the Peabody Hotel is of the Duckmaster. A very unusual title to hold. It's my job to train the team of ducks that we have here and they have a $200,000 Duck Palace upstairs on the rooftop. There would be at least two to 300 people on the busy days. The number of people doing the duck march, we're talking into the thousand.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ladies and gentlemen, if I may direct your attention to the elevators having just left their penthouse on the roof to join you. Looking good. Ladies and gentlemen, the march of the world-famous Peabody Ducks.  WALKER: All the way to the fountain, I need everybody to use the steps. Come on, duckies. Let's do it. Everybody say good morning, Duckies.  CROWD: Good morning, Duckies:  WALKER: Fantastic. Everybody use those steps for me. Everybody up the steps. Looking good there's. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Great job, Duckies.  To know you're providing an experience that's unlike any other, it's a privilege. I don't consider it a job. I feel like it's no pun intended, but it's a calling.  (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  We love puns, and they should always be intended. All right. I told a taradiddle I will quack a joke today. What do ducks wear to fancy parties? A duck-sedo. All right. We had some great your word Wednesday submissions. Vocabulary words are off the charts. Awesome. Thanks to @Mikayla04264. Taradiddle, a noun meaning a petty lie.  And thanks to Pocono Mountain East High School for overmorrow, meaning the day after tomorrow. Well done. Shoutout time now, we're headed to Massachusetts to Tyngsborough, home of the Griffins, Greater Lowell Technical High School, you rock. We hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one.  I'm Coy Wire, and we are CNN 10.  END230331

COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR: Hello, lovely people. It's Friday. Finally, happy that you're spending some time with me. If you're hyped and you're liking this rhyme with me, we'll do it again on the 10. That'd be fine by me. Hey, now, let's go. It's been an awesome week and we're going to finish this week strong. We're starting today's show, we're going to talk about the big news on the artificial intelligence front. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is, in simple terms, technology that enables machines to mimic human intelligence. It includes a wide range of technology, though. There are personal assistants like Siri on smartphones or Alexa on devices in houses. There are self-driving cars, food serving robots and lots more. AI technology is rapidly evolving, and it has the potential to completely change society even more as we know it. A product launched this year called ChatGPT is grabbing headlines because of its uncanny ability to have intelligent conversations with humans, answer questions in written form and mimic people nearly perfectly. Experts are now voicing some serious concerns. There's potential for AI to increasingly take more jobs away from people, allow students to easily cheat in school, and for people to use other identities to spread misinformation. In some cases, AI technology is now being created to combat the problems that were caused by AI in the first place. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EDWARD TIAN, FOURNDER, GPTZERO:  It's incredible innovation. At the same time, it's like opening a Pandora's box. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS & POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Which is why Edward Tian, a 22-year-old Princeton student himself, spent his winter break building GPTZero, which he says can detect whether something is likely written by a human or ChatGPT. He says teachers use it to check their students' papers. (On camera):  Is this like one AI cross checking another AI? TIAN:  In a sense, yeah. (On camera):  But can it spot misinformation? TIAN:  Oh, OK. Yeah. So as opposed to misinformation, it's more of like it can only spot if something is AI generated or human generated. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Major leaders in tech like Elon Musk, professors and researchers, are so concerned about the rapid development of artificial intelligence that they're now calling for AI labs to stop developing the technology completely for at least six months. They signed a letter which is published by the Future of Life Institute, a nonprofit backed by Musk. The letter comes just two weeks after OpenAI announced GPT-4, an even more powerful version of the ChatGPT technology. This version was able to pass tests, create websites, even draft lawsuits. The tech leaders want experts to develop a set of protocols or rules for AI, and they said if they don't, the government needs to step in and stop it. CNN's Correspondent Donie O'Sullivan met with a professor at UC Berkeley School of Information and tried out an AI software that mimics voices to see how powerful and dangerous this technology could be. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NOREEN O'SULLIVAN, MOTHER OF DONIE O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Hello? A.I. DONIE O'SULLIVAN:  Hi, mom. N. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Hi, Donie. How are you? A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  Does my voice sound different to you? N. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Yeah, I just said that to Sinead (Donie's sister). I said Donie sounds so American. (LAUGHTER) A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  This is not actually me. This is a voice made by computer. N. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Oh, my God. Are you serious? A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  Yeah, sorry. DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  There has been an explosion and fake audio and voices being generated through artificial intelligence technology. AI-GENERATED VOICE:  This is an A.I. clone version of Walter White's voice. AI-GENERATED VOICE:  This is an A.I. clone version of Leonardo de Caprio's voice. O'SULLIVAN:  All you need is a couple minutes recording of anyone's voice and you can make it seem like they have said just about anything, even -- AI-GENERATED VOICE:  Anderson Cooper. We've come here to U.C. Berkeley today to talk to Hany Farid, a digital forensic expert, about just how easy it is to put words into other people's mouths. O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  It's a lot of fun. HANY FARID, PROFESSOR, UC BERKLEY SCHOOL OF INFORMATION:  Sure. O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  But it's also really scary. FARID:  I think once you put aside that Jewish (ph) factor, I don't think it takes a long time to look at the risks. AI-GENERATED VOICE:  This is Wolf Blitzer. Hany Farid, you're in the situation room. FARID:  That's good. O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  That sounds real. (Voice-over):  By uploading just a few minutes of me and so my colleagues' voices to an A.I. audio service, I was able to create some convincing fakes. The technology did struggle with my Irish accent, but we decided to put it to the ultimate test with my parents. (On camera):  I'm about to try call my mom back in Ireland and see if I can trick her with this voice. FARID:  Yeah. O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  Let's see if we are going to be successful. FARID:  I'm nervous. My hands are. (LAUGHTER) O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  All right. (RINGING) N. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Hello? A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  Hi, mom. N. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Hi, Donie. How are you? A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  Just finished shooting our story here. I'm going to the airport in a while. N. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  There seems to be a delay in the phone, Donie. A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  Can I say a quick hello to dad? N. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Yep. DONAL O'SULLIVAN, FATHER OF DONIE O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Hi, Donie. A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  Hi, dad. D. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  How are you doing? A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  How are you? D. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Good, yourself? A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  Just finished shooting our story here. I am going to the airport in a while. D. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Oh, you're going back to New York? A.I. O'SULLIVAN:  Are Kerry playing this weekend? D. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  They're playing Tyrone Sunday. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  My dad went on to have a conversation with the A.I. Donie about how Kerry, our home football team, had a game that weekend. Eventually, I had to come clean. (On camera):  Dad, I will give you a call better later on. Can you just put me back to mom for a second? (Voice-over):  My parents knew something was off, but ultimately, they still fell for it. N. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Oh, yeah, some of it don't be bad, but it was like -- it was like your voice was a little tone lower and it sounded like very serious like you had something serious to say. Because I went, oh, jeez, my heart was hopping first. O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  Oh, sorry. D. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  I thought the voice was very funny. Thought the voice was very funny, yeah. O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  All right, I'll call you later, dad. D. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  OK, bye-bye. O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  Bye. FARID:  This is not classic. The mom is like, something is wrong with my son. The dad is like, everything is fine. (LAUGHTER) AI-GENERATED VOICE:  I'd like to close out today's ceremony with a question. If you are given a choice, would you choose to have unlimited bacon but no more video games? O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  With fake Biden and Trump recordings going viral online, Farid says this could be something to be wary of going into the 2024 election. FARID:  When we enter this world where anything can be fake, any image, any audio, any video, any piece of text, nothing has to be real, we have what's called a liars' dividend, which is that anybody can deny reality. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  With a flood of new A.I. tools releasing online, he says companies developing this powerful technology need to think of its potential negative effects. FARID:  There is no online and offline world. There is one world. And it is fully integrated. When things happen on the internet, they have real implications for individuals, for communities, for societies, for democracies. And I don't think we as a field have fully come to grips with our responsibility here. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  In the meantime, I will continue annoying my colleagues. (On camera):  Hear this thing Anderson said. AI-GENERATED VOICE:  I have been doing this a long time. I have to say, Donie O'Sullivan is probably the best in the business. O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  Incredible. FARID:  Very good. O'SULLIVAN (on camera):  That's very kind of him to say that as well. FARID:  You know, you should be honored, really.

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  What's up, everyone? I'm Coy Wire, coming to you from Houston, Texas, today. Rise up.  I am here covering all the action at this year's final four and the college basketball national championship game. I am so grateful to be here with you to help you jump start your week right here on CNN 10. Now we do start today with some tragic news for our lead story. The communities in the South and Midwest regions of the United States were hit by severe tornadoes, more than 50 preliminary tornado reports were recorded Friday in at least seven states and communities across the country faced absolute devastation this weekend. Neighborhoods were leveled with homes and businesses destroyed, the roofs of buildings were torn off by wind and as of Sunday, when we recorded our show, 27 people have been reported dead.  And the threat of more tornadoes had shifted to the southern plains where nearly 13 million people in north Texas, including the Dallas-Fort Worth area face an enhanced risk for severe weather. The latest destructive weather across the South and Midwest comes just a week after a severe tornado walloped up the southeast, killing at least another 26 people and destroying much of Rolling Fork, Mississippi.  In addition, storms have also knocked out power to these struggling communities. When we recorded our show Sunday, more than 30,000 customers in Arkansas remain impacted by power outages, with hundreds of thousands more without power across the south and northeast, including 120,000 in Pennsylvania, 73,000 in Ohio.  The governors of Indiana, Iowa, Illinois and Arkansas have all declared emergency or disaster declarations in their states to provide immediate assistance to impacted counties. President Joe Biden has also issued a major disaster declaration for Arkansas.  We'll hear now from CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam who's currently in Wynne, Arkansas, assessing the damage. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  We are in badly devastated Wynne, Arkansas, where electrical vehicles and companies are on the scene, trying to assess the initial damage here that the mayor described has literally split his town in half. And we are standing directly in that path from this devastating tornado.  I want you to see behind me, this is a home, that is a living room and that's somebody's piano. There's no music being played there today. This house has been vacated. There have been injuries.  Overnight, there were active search and recovery efforts taking place. We've walked around this area. The Wynne high school here in Arkansas, home to the Yellowjackets, their home football field was decimated by this tornado and I want you to see it from the air because you can notice the kind of indiscriminate nature of a tornado and how its path of destruction is very concentrated.  It's literally like peeling back the skin off of an orange, took the artificial turf and ripped it off of their home field. But on the other side of the football field, it was left untouched so were some homes. but the areas where it hit hardest of course completely devastated and we have seen just the true nature of how incredible Mother Nature can be. It is a scary morning as we get first light and get a idea of just how bad this tornado really was. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Former President Donald Trump is expected to appear in a New York courtroom tomorrow, following a formal criminal charge late last week by a Manhattan grand jury. The charges include more than 30 counts related to business fraud, but the specific details of the indictment have not been made public. This is the first time in U.S. history that a current or former president has been criminally charged.  But did you know that Ulysses S. Grant was once arrested for speeding. That's right, speeding on his horse-drawn carriage all the way back in 1872. Now, in response to the charges, the former president has maintained his innocence and claims that the charges are politically motivated. The unprecedented nature of bringing a former U.S. president in for criminal charges has activated a complex choreographed security effort in the city of New York. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz is in Manhattan as the city prepares for Tuesday's arraignment. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  With an unprecedented indictment comes immense security challenges. The NYPD, along with court officers U.S. marshals and the United States secret service are running through logistics of how Tuesday's historic arraignment of the former president will go down. Law enforcement sources telling CNN officials are conducting a dry run of Trump's movements including his motorcade route to the courthouse in downtown Manhattan where he is expected to be arraigned Tuesday afternoon. How he will get inside the courtroom flanked by Secret Service and what will the arrest process look like. Will he be treated like any other defendant?  The former president expected to be fingerprinted and photographed for a mug shot. It's a massive effort starting when Trump arrives by plane Monday, securing Trump Tower, the court and the motorcade route. KENNETH COREY, FORMER NYPD CHIEF OF DEPARTMENT:  In this case though where you have a former president and certainly a president with as large a following as former President Trump, there's a lot of unique concerns that are going to come into play. I think that the bigger unknown here is going to come in the form of protests or potential protests.  PROKUPECZ:  Officials are also bracing for protests after Trump urged his supporters to protest his arrest when news of the indictment reportedly neared.  So far, the mayor's office says there are no credible threats to the city and out of an abundance of caution, every member of the NYPD, some 35,000 officers, are reporting for duty in uniform and prepared for mobilization. COREY:  The challenge for the NYPD is going to be protecting everybody's First Amendment right, allowing everybody to have their voice heard and to do so in a way that keeps the peace. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Next, we're catching up with Nelly Cheboi who was named CNN Hero of the Year. Her non-profit organization TechLit has gained widespread recognition for its efforts to up-cycle old computers and provide tech education to rural communities in Kenya. We'll delve into Nelly's experiences since winning the award and here firsthand what it meant to achieve such a momentous victory. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON COOPER AND KELLY RIPA, CNN TOP CNN HEROES HOSTS:  Nelly Cheboi. (CHEERS) NELLY CHEBOI, CNN HERO OF THE YEAR:  You can only imagine like how crazy it was when I was named the CNN Hero of the Year. I thought I was like, I'm about to fall down. I look at the audience. You know, it was my mom screaming back at me. Like most women that come before her, they die in poverty like that's all they know -- poverty. I don't think it can get any bigger than that.  It was really heartwarming to see that the work was bigger than me now. WILLIAM RUTO, KENYAN PRESIDENT:  We also congratulate Nelly Cheboi. CHEBOI:  The president of Kenya congratulated me, talked about TechLit, which has become a household name in Kenya. Everyone knows that we are teaching kids computer skills. What I'm really excited about is the future in Kenya and in the rest of the continent where kids are going to be learning about the tech world. Let's start with him. There's hope like poverty has an expiration date, right?  When you were growing up in poverty, you think of yourself as less than. I knew just how powerful the kids celebrating this award was, I wanted to turn that into like hey, yes, this can happen for you, too. Yes. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: Who invented the game of basketball? Jerry West, James Naismith, Abner Doubleday or Walter Camp? On December 21st, 1891, PE instructor James Naismith using a soccer ball and two peach baskets created what was called a new game of ball. (MUSIC) WIRE:  Today's story getting a out of is from right here in Texas. We've had a ball covering what's been called the wildest final four of all time, women's and men's. Last night in the women's championship game, it was LSU winning it all. They've been led all season by superstar Angel Reese and their hall of fame coach, of course, Kim Mulkey, who has some of the most flamboyant fashion in all of sports. You go, Tigers! Congrats to LSU.  And tonight, right here in Houston in that stadium behind me, the men's title game. It'll be San Diego State and UConn playing for all the marbles. I caught up with the head coaches from each team and found out that they are both superstitious. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIAN DUTCHER, SAN DIEGO STATE MEN'S BASKETBALL COACH:  I wear the same shoes, the same socks, you know, I'm -- I'm -- I'm trying to stay consistent with what I've got on for every game. We're on a win streak, I don't want to change anything. WIRE:  Same shoes, how long you've been wearing them? DUTCHER:  They've been through two Gatorade baths, two cutting down of nets. WIRE:  Is it true that you've been wearing a certain same sort of a clothing article for superstitious reasons? DAN HURLEY, UCONN MEN'S BASKETBALL COACH:  Yeah, I -- that's definitely true, as well as the socks. But the socks are unremarkable, they're just a blue pair. WIRE:  But the same pair. HURLEY:  Same pair and I've gone back to an older pair of shoes that I won at Rhode Island when we -- when we won in the NCAA tournament there. (END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE:  Now, I'm not superstitious, but I am sometimes a little bit stitches. How about you? Any superstitions?  One thing we always do though because we believe it keeps the good mojo flowing is give a shout-out every show to show you some love.  Today's shout out is going to Rochester, Minnesota. Willow Creek Middle School, go Wildcats! We see you we hope you and everyone watching around the world have a wonderful one. I'm Coy Wire and we are CNN 10. END230404

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
COY WIRE, CNN 10 ANCHOR:  Hello, lovely people. Terrific Tuesday to you.  I'm still here in Houston after watching a great NCAA men's national championship basketball game last night. It has been awesome. Running into some of you while I've been here. Thanks for all the love. All right. Let's get this show started, shall we?  Let's start among the stars with some news from outer space, as it's looking likely that we'll be seeing some history being made. NASA's Frank Rubio on track to become the first American astronaut to spend a full year in space. Rubio traveled to the International Space Station back on September 21st, thinking it would be just a six-month mission.  He was expected to land back on Earth this spring, but the Russian spacecraft that carried Rubio and two of his Russian colleagues actually had a coolant leak in December. Russia's space agency later announced that it wouldn't have been safe for the spacecraft to bring all the astronauts home. This means Rubio has to stay even longer in space. NASA announced the early is he can return to earth now will be on September 27th and that would mean he'd be logging at least 371 days in orbit.  Rubio's tour of duty would be historic as it would surpass the previous American record which is 355 days set just last year. The world record still belongs to a Russian cosmonaut who logged 437 continuous days in orbit aboard Russia's Mir space station back in 1994 and '95.  Now, this is all really a unique situation particularly because even though the U.S. and Russia have intense geopolitical tensions here on Earth, both superpowers are working hand in hand when it comes to space exploration. Our Michael Holmes has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A collaboration in space when relations between Russia and the U.S. on earth are at their worst in decades. NASA and Russia's space agency Roscosmos say they've signed a long-sort seat swapping agreement which would allow astronauts and cosmonauts to exchange places on missions. NASA says the first of these cross flights is expected when U.S. astronaut Frank Rubio blasts off to the International Space Station on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft. And cosmonaut Anna Kikina joins the fifth SpaceX crew Dragon launch the same month. Historic rivals space exploration has always been a point of highs and lows for Russia in the U.S., both trying to outdo each other in the 1960s space race. The Soviet Union sending the first man into outer space, the U.S. landing the first crew on the moon. But in recent decades, space has been more of a joint effort between the two nations, especially after the creation of the ISS, which is operated by NASA, Roscosmos and several other space agencies.  Both the U.S. and Russia have hitched rides with each other. Russian cosmonauts flew on the U.S. space shuttle before the fleet was replied in 2011. After that, American astronauts traveled to the ISS on Soyuz spacecraft, until NASA resumed its own launches in 2020 by partnering with the commercial space company SpaceX.  (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  When Arkansas,  home of the Yellowjackets, we are currently standing on what was the home football field for the Wynne high school.  Look at this -- this is one of the light structures that were supposed to illuminate this field. You can see some of the broken lights here below us.  But what's most astounding to this meteorologist is just the true force of this powerful twister that tore this path of devastation. Hard to get the perspective but I'll show you an aerial what you're looking at is the peeled back artificial turf that was sucked up by the powerful updraft of this tornado.  There it is still in place in the distance and then look at what's behind me here, like a skin of an orange being peeled back. This is what's left leaving the rock exposed below it and behind me, Wynne Yellowjackets proudly displayed on the water tower. This area has received significant to catastrophic damage. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  Ten-second trivia: in which of these countries would you find the world's tallest waterfall? Venezuela, Canada, Peru or Zimbabwe? Located in the South American country of Venezuela, the 3,200-foot Angel Falls is the tallest fall of them all. Now, some people don't go chasing waterfalls. They stick to the rivers and lakes that they're used to. But in Venezuela, some things just aren't what they used to be like news anchors. Venezuelans are seeing increased fake news and widespread misinformation about their country through avatars, fake anchors made of artificial intelligence reporting the news.  Though the avatars may have been created as a faster way to communicate information these fake videos are now being used to hide real problems going on inside Venezuela and many see it as propaganda. Stefano Pozzebon is on the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  This isn't actually a real person. Take a closer look. This fake avatar was created using artificial intelligence to look like a real human. In recent months, videos like these have been shared across Venezuelan social media and even on state-run television to spread misinformation about the country. FAKE AVATAR:  Media from different countries had described the event organized by Venezuela as a total and unexpected success. POZZEBON:  This year, Venezuelans have been taken to the street to demand better living conditions. The country's minimum wage is less than ten dollars a month. And last year, inflation was over 200 percent.  But this artificial news clips have been trying to make the country look more prosperous. Marivi Marvin Vasquez (ph), the executive director at ProBox, a Venezuelan- based organization that monitors for online misinformation, says that these A.I.-generated people have been created and spread with a specific purpose. MARIVI MARVIN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, PROBOX:  To sell to the international community a different reality about the country, of success, happiness and stability that really doesn't exist. FAKE AVATAR:  So how true is it that Venezuela is such a poor country? Has the media exaggerated things in that place? POZZEBON:  And it's not just social media. The Venezuelan government itself is helping to spread these videos on social media and even on state-run television. Even Nicolas Maduro, the country's embattled president, has shared the videos. NICOLAS MADURO, VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT (translated):  They are all artificial intelligence. They do not exist. They are robots created by artificial intelligence. I am robot.  POZZEBON:  These fake videos are often in English with Spanish subtitles and are shared on social media which is often a trusty source of news for many Venezuelans, because the government imposes strict controls on the country's traditional media. CRISTINA TARDAGUILA, SENIOR PROGRAM DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR JOURNALISTS:  You go from completely lack of reliable information in the traditional media, in your region, and then you go towards the other end. So, you're suddenly like eating, drinking, smelling everything that is on your WhatsApp or your telegram or your social media. FAKE AVATAR:  Start by selecting an A.I. avatar. FAKE AVATAR:  Like me. FAKE AVATAR:  Or me. FAKE AVATAR:  Or me. POZZEBON:  These A.I. avatars are advertised as a way for companies to create easy to make instructional videos for example. The company behind the technology says that it's not intended to spread false narratives. When asked for comment, the company told CNN that it has since banned House of News from using it's A.I. software. YouTube has also removed the channel from its platform.  It's still unclear who originally created these videos, as well as if the Venezuelan government was involved. The government did not respond to CNN's request for comment. FAKE AVATAR:  Hey there. I'm Matt and I can -- POZZEBON:  If you're unsure about whether or not a video that you're watching is done by one of these fake avatars, pay close attention to their speech and mouth movement. FAKE AVATAR:  Has a dozen pavilions that occupy 23 hectares. POZZEBON:  Do their words align with the movements of their mouth. Do this movement feel awkward or constricted.  FAKE AVATAR:  Security will be in charge of guards from the general directory. POZZEBON:  If that is the case, you're watching a digital avatar. It's not a real person. FAKE AVATAR:  In Venezuela, it is estimated that 8 million people will mobilize in the next vacation. POZZEBON:  When your friend and your own government are sharing this misinformation, it demands a lot more vigilance to see through the lies and find the truth. (END VIDEOTAPE) WIRE:  All right. We started this show way up high in the sky in space but now we're taking you way down underwater for today's 10 out of 10.  Scientists filmed the deepest fish on record. They released this footage of a young snail fish swimming deep in the trenches off of Japan at a depth of more than 27,000 feet. That's almost as deep as the 29,000-foot Mount Everest is high, and this fish is about 2,000 feet deeper than the previous record. Marine biologists said that younger deep sea snail fish like this one often stay as deep as possible to avoid being eaten by bigger predators swimming above. Now some other fish are swimming down solo because they dropped out of school. Hey, yo, dad jokes for you. Let's finish this strong with my favorite part of the show. I want to give a special shout out to Park Middle School in Lincoln, Nebraska. We see you representing the Corn Husker State.  Thanks for subscribing and commenting on our CNN YouTube Channel, and thanks for all the love. Many blessings y'all. Go out and make it an awesome day. I'm Coy Wire and we are CNN 10. END
